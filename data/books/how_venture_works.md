nvention and innovation drive the U.S. economy.
What’s more, they have a powerful grip on the nation’s 
collective imagination. The popular press is ﬁlled with
against-all-odds success stories of Silicon Valley entrepre-
neurs. In these sagas, the entrepreneur is the modern-day
cowboy, roaming new industrial frontiers much the same
way that earlier Americans explored the West. At his side
stands the venture capitalist, a trail-wise sidekick ready
to help the hero through all the tight spots – in exchange,
of course, for a piece of the action.

As with most myths, there’s some truth to this story.
Arthur Rock, Tommy Davis, Tom Perkins, Eugene Kleiner,
and other early venture capitalists are legendary for the

panies, and venture capitalists. It is located in Menlo Park, California.

parts they played in creating the modern computer
industry. Their investing knowledge and operating
experience were as valuable as their capital. But as
the  venture  capital  business  has  evolved  over  the
past 30 years, the image of a cowboy with his side-
kick  has  become  increasingly  outdated.  Today’s
venture capitalists look more like bankers, and the
entrepreneurs  they  fund  look  more  like  M.B.A.’s. 
The  U.S.  venture-capital  industry  is  envied
throughout  the  world  as  an  engine  of  economic
growth.  Although  the  collective  imagination  ro-
manticizes  the  industry,  separating  the  popular
myths from the current realities is crucial to under-
standing how this important piece of the U.S. econ-
omy operates. For entrepreneurs (and would-be en-
trepreneurs), such an analysis may prove especially
beneﬁcial. 

Venture Capital Fills a Void
Contrary  to  popular  perception,  venture  capital
plays only a minor role in funding basic innovation.
Venture capitalists invested more than $10 billion
in 1997, but only 6%, or $600 million, went to start-
ups. Moreover, we estimate that less than $1 billion
of the total venture-capital pool went to R&D. The
majority of that capital went to follow-on funding
for  projects  originally  developed  through  the  far
greater  expenditures  of  governments  ($63 billion)
and corporations ($133 billion).

Where venture money plays an important role is
in the next stage of the innovation life cycle – the
period in a company’s life when it begins to com-
mercialize  its  innovation.  We  estimate  that  more
than 80% of the money invested by venture capital-
ists goes into building the infrastructure required to
grow the business – in expense investments (manu-
facturing,  marketing,  and  sales)  and  the  balance
sheet (providing ﬁxed assets and working capital).
Venture money is not long-term money. The idea
is to invest in a company’s balance sheet and infra-
structure until it reaches a sufficient size and credi-
bility so that it can be sold to a corporation or so
that  the  institutional  public-equity  markets  can
step in and provide liquidity. In essence, the ven-
ture  capitalist  buys  a  stake  in  an  entrepreneur’s
idea, nurtures it for a short period of time, and then
exits with the help of an investment banker. 

Venture  capital’s  niche  exists  because  of  the
structure  and  rules  of  capital  markets.  Someone
with an idea or a new technology often has no other
institution to turn to. Usury laws limit the interest
banks can charge on loans – and the risks inherent
in  start-ups  usually  justify  higher  rates  than  al-
lowed by law. Thus bankers will only ﬁnance a new

Profile of the Ideal
Entrepreneur

From a venture capitalist’s perspective, the ideal
entrepreneur:

n is qualiﬁed in a “hot” area of interest,

n delivers sales or technical advances such as FDA

approval with reasonable probability,

n tells a compelling story and is presentable to

outside investors,

n recognizes the need for speed to an IPO for 

liquidity, 

n has a good reputation and can provide references

that show competence and skill,

n understands the need for a team with a variety 

of skills and therefore sees why equity has to be 
allocated to other people,

n works diligently toward a goal but maintains

ﬂexibility,

n gets along with the investor group,

n understands the cost of capital and typical deal

structures and is not offended by them,

n is sought after by many VCs, 

n has realistic expectations about process and 

outcome.

business  to  the  extent  that  there  are  hard  assets
against which to secure the debt. And in today’s in-
formation-based  economy,  many  start-ups  have
few hard assets. 

Furthermore, investment banks and public equity
are both constrained by regulations and operating
practices meant to protect the public investor. His-
torically,  a  company  could  not  access  the  public
market without sales of about $15 million, assets of
$10 million, and a reasonable proﬁt history. To put
this in perspective, less than 2% of the more than 
5 million  corporations  in  the  United  States  have
more than $10 million in revenues. Although the
IPO  threshold  has  been  lowered  recently  through
the issuance of development-stage company stocks,
in general the ﬁnancing window for companies with
less than $10 million in revenue remains closed to
the entrepreneur.

Venture capital ﬁlls the void between sources of
funds for innovation (chieﬂy corporations, govern-
ment  bodies,  and  the  entrepreneur’s  friends  and
family) and traditional, lower-cost sources of capi-

132

tal available to ongoing concerns. Filling that void
successfully  requires  the  venture  capital  industry
to provide a sufficient return on capital to attract
private equity funds, attractive returns for its own
participants, and sufficient upside potential to en-
trepreneurs  to  attract  high-quality  ideas  that  will
generate high returns. Put simply, the challenge is
to  earn  a  consistently  superior  return  on  invest-
ments in inherently risky business ventures.

Sufficient Returns at Acceptable Risk
Investors in venture capital funds are typically very
large institutions such as pension funds, ﬁnancial
ﬁrms, insurance companies, and university endow-
ments – all of which put a small percentage of their
total funds into high-risk investments. They expect
a return of between 25% and 35% per year over the
lifetime  of  the  investment.  Because  these  invest-
ments represent such a tiny part of the institutional
investors’ portfolios, venture capitalists have a lot
of latitude. What leads these institutions to invest
in  a  fund  is  not  the  speciﬁc  investments  but  the
firm’s overall track record, the fund’s “story,” and
their conﬁdence in the partners themselves. 

How do venture capitalists meet their investors’
expectations at acceptable risk levels? The answer
lies  in  their  investment  proﬁle  and  in  how  they
structure each deal.

The Investment Proﬁle. One myth is that venture
capitalists  invest  in  good  people  and  good  ideas.
The reality is that they invest in good industries –
that is, industries that are more competitively for-
giving than the market as a whole. In 1980, for ex-
ample, nearly 20% of venture capital
investments  went  to  the  energy  in-
dustry. More recently, the ﬂow of cap-
ital  has  shifted  rapidly  from  genetic
engineering,  specialty  retailing,  and
computer  hardware  to  CD-ROMs,
multimedia, telecommunications, and
software companies. Now, more than
25%  of  disbursements  are  devoted 
to the Internet “space.” The apparent
randomness  of  these  shifts  among
technologies and industry segments is misleading;
the targeted segment in each case was growing fast,
and its capacity promised to be constrained in the
next ﬁve years. To put this in context, we estimate
that less than 10% of all U.S. economic activity oc-
curs in segments projected to grow more than 15% a
year over the next ﬁve years. 

In effect, venture capitalists focus on the middle
part  of  the  classic  industry  S-curve.  They  avoid
both the early stages, when technologies are uncer-

h ow   v e n t u r e   c a p i t a l   wo r k s

tain and market needs are unknown, and the later
stages, when competitive shakeouts and consolida-
tions are inevitable and growth rates slow dramati-
cally.  Consider  the  disk  drive  industry.  In  1983,
more than 40 venture-funded companies and more
than 80 others existed. By late 1984, the industry
market  value  had  plunged  from  $5.4 billion  to 
$1.4 billion. Today only ﬁve major players remain. 
Growing  within  high-growth  segments  is  a  lot
easier than doing so in low-, no-, or negative-growth
ones,  as  every  businessperson  knows.  In  other
words, regardless of the talent or charisma of indi-
vidual  entrepreneurs,  they  rarely  receive  backing
from  a  VC  if  their  businesses  are  in  low-growth
market  segments.  What  these  investment  ﬂows 
reﬂect, then, is a consistent pattern of capital allo-
cation  into  industries  where  most  companies  are
likely to look good in the near term. 

During this adolescent period of high and acceler-
ating  growth,  it  can  be  extremely  hard  to  distin-
guish the eventual winners from the losers because
their ﬁnancial performance and growth rates look
strikingly similar. (See the chart “Timing Is Every-
thing.”) At this stage, all companies are struggling
to  deliver  products  to  a  product-starved  market.
Thus the critical challenge for the venture capital-
ist is to identify competent management that can
execute – that is, supply the growing demand. 

Picking the wrong industry or betting on a tech-
nology  risk  in  an  unproven  market  segment  is
something VCs avoid. Exceptions to this rule tend
to involve “concept” stocks, those that hold great
promise  but  that  take  an  extremely  long  time  to
succeed. Genetic engineering companies illustrate

The myth is that venture
capitalists invest in good people
and good ideas. The reality is that
they invest in good industries.

this point. In that industry, the venture capitalist’s
challenge is to identify entrepreneurs who can ad-
vance  a  key  technology  to  a  certain  stage – FDA 
approval, for example – at which point the company
can be taken public or sold to a major corporation. 
By investing in areas with high growth rates, VCs
primarily  consign  their  risks  to  the  ability  of  the
company’s  management  to  execute.  VC  invest-
ments in high-growth segments are likely to have
exit opportunities because investment bankers are

timing is every thing

More than 80% of the money invested by venture
capitalists goes into the adolescent phase of a com-
pany’s  life  cycle.  In  this  period  of  accelerated
growth,  the  ﬁnancials  of  both  the  eventual  win-
ners and losers look strikingly similar.

continually  looking  for  new  high-growth  issues 
to bring to market. The issues will be easier to sell
and likely to support high relative valuations – and
therefore  high  commissions  for  the  investment
bankers. Given the risk of these types of deals, in-
vestment  bankers’  commissions  are  typically  6%

to  8%  of the  money  raised  through  an IPO. Thus 
an effort of only several months on the part of a few
professionals and brokers can result in millions of
dollars in commissions. 

As long as venture capitalists are able to exit the
company and industry before it tops out, they can
reap  extraordinary  returns  at  relatively  low  risk.
Astute venture capitalists operate in a secure niche
where  traditional,  low-cost  ﬁnancing  is  unavail-
able. High rewards can be paid to successful man-
agement teams, and institutional investment will
be available to provide liquidity in a relatively short
period of time.

The Logic of the Deal. There are many variants of
the basic deal structure, but whatever the speciﬁcs,
the  logic  of  the  deal  is  always  the  same:  to  give 
investors  in  the  venture  capital  fund  both  ample
downside  protection  and  a  favorable  position  for
additional investment if the company proves to be 
a winner.

In  a  typical  start-up  deal,  for  example,  the  ven-
ture capital fund will invest $3 million in exchange
for a 40% preferred-equity ownership position, al-
though recent valuations have been much higher.
The preferred provisions offer downside protection.
For instance, the venture capitalists receive a liqui-
dation preference. A liquidation feature simulates
debt  by  giving  100%  preference  over  common
shares held by management until the VC’s $3 mil-
lion is returned. In other words, should the venture
fail, they are given ﬁrst claim to all the company’s
assets  and  technology.  In  addition,  the  deal  often 
includes  blocking  rights  or  disproportional  voting
rights over key decisions, including the sale of the
company or the timing of an IPO. 

The contract is also likely to contain downside
protection in the form of antidilution clauses, or
ratchets. Such clauses protect against equity dilu-
tion  if  subsequent  rounds  of  ﬁnancing  at  lower
values  take  place.  Should  the  company  stumble
and  have  to  raise  more  money  at  a  lower  valua-
tion, the venture ﬁrm will be given enough shares
to  maintain  its  original  equity  position – that  is,
the total percentage of equity owned. That prefer-
ential treatment typically comes at the expense of
the  common  shareholders,  or  management,  as
well  as  investors  who  are  not  affiliated  with  the
VC ﬁrm and who do not continue to invest on a
pro rata basis. 

Alternatively,  if  a  company  is  doing  well,  in-
vestors enjoy upside provisions, sometimes giving
them  the  right  to  put  additional  money  into  the
venture at a predetermined price. That means ven-
ture investors can increase their stakes in success-
ful ventures at below market prices.

The venture capital industry has four main players: entrepreneurs who need funding; investors
who want high returns; investment bankers who need companies to sell; and the venture capi-
talists who make money for themselves by making a market for the other three.

VC  ﬁrms  also  protect  themselves  from  risk  by
coinvesting with other ﬁrms. Typically, there will
be a “lead” investor and several “followers.” It is
the exception, not the rule, for one VC to ﬁnance an
individual company entirely. Rather, venture ﬁrms
prefer to have two or three groups involved in most
stages of ﬁnancing. Such relationships provide fur-
ther portfolio diversiﬁcation – that is, the ability to
invest in more deals per dollar of invested capital.
They also decrease the workload of the VC partners
by  getting  others  involved  in  assessing  the  risks
during  the  due  diligence  period  and  in  managing 
the deal. And the presence of several VC ﬁrms adds
credibility. In fact, some observers have suggested
that the truly smart fund will always be a follower
of the top-tier ﬁrms. 

Attractive Returns for the VC
In return for ﬁnancing one to two years of a com-
pany’s  start-up,  venture  capitalists  expect  a  ten
times  return  of  capital  over  ﬁve  years.  Combined
with  the  preferred  position,  this  is  very  high-cost
capital: a loan with a 58% annual compound inter-
est rate that cannot be prepaid. But that rate is nec-
essary to deliver average fund returns above 20%.

Funds are structured to guarantee partners a com-
fortable income while they work to generate those
returns. The venture capital partners agree to return
all of the investors’ capital before sharing in the up-
side. However, the fund typically pays for the inves-
tors’  annual  operating  budget – 2%  to  3%  of  the
pool’s total capital – which they take as a manage-
ment fee regardless of the fund’s results. If there is 
a $100 million pool and four or ﬁve partners, for ex-
ample, the partners are essentially assured salaries
of $200,000 to $400,000 plus operating expenses for
seven to ten years. (If the fund fails, of course, the
group will be unable to raise funds in the future.)
Compare  those  figures  with  Tommy Davis  and
Arthur Rock’s ﬁrst fund, which was $5 million but
had a total management fee of only $75,000 a year.
The  real  upside  lies  in  the  appreciation  of  the
portfolio. The investors get 70% to 80% of the gains;
the  venture  capitalists  get  the  remaining  20%  to
30%.  The  amount  of  money  any  partner  receives
beyond salary is a function of the total growth of the
portfolio’s value and the amount of money managed
per partner. (See the exhibit “Pay for Performance.”)
Thus  for  a  typical  portfolio – say,  $20 million
managed per partner and 30% total appreciation on
the  fund – the  average  annual  compensation  per

These odds play out in venture capital portfolios:
more  than  half  the  companies  will  at  best  return
only the original investment and at worst be total
losses.  Given  the  portfolio  approach  and  the  deal
structure  VCs  use,  however,  only  10%  to  20%  of
the  companies  funded  need  to  be  real  winners  to
achieve the targeted return rate of 25% to 30%. In
fact, VC reputations are often built on one or two
good investments.

partner will be about $2.4 million per year, nearly
all  of  which  comes  from  fund  appreciation.  And
that  compensation  is  multiplied  for  partners  who
manage several funds. From an investor’s perspec-
tive,  this  compensation  is  acceptable  because  the
venture capitalists have provided a very attractive
return on investment and their incentives are en-
tirely aligned with making the investment a success. 
What part does the venture capitalist play in max-
imizing the  growth  of  the  portfolio’s  value?  In  an
ideal world, all of the ﬁrm’s investments would be
winners.  But  the  world  isn’t  ideal;  even  with  the
best management, the odds of failure for any indi-
vidual company are high. 

On  average,  good  plans,  people,  and  businesses
succeed only one in ten times. To see why, consider
that there are many components critical to a com-
pany’s success. The best companies might have an
80% probability of succeeding at each of them. But
even  with  these  odds,  the  probability  of  eventual
success will be less than 20% because failing to ex-
ecute on any one component can torpedo the entire
company.

Those probabilities also have a great impact on
how the venture capitalists spend their time. Little
time is required (and sometimes best not spent) on
the  real  winners – or  the  worst  performers,  called
numnuts (“no  money,  no  time”).  Instead,  the  VC 
allocates  a  significant  amount  of  time  to  those 
middle portfolio companies, determining whether
and how the investment can be turned around and
whether continued participation is advisable. The
equity ownership and the deal structure described
earlier give the VCs the ﬂexibility to make manage-
ment  changes,  particularly  for  those  companies
whose performance has been mediocre.

Most VCs distribute their time among many ac-
tivities (see the exhibit “How Venture Capitalists
Spend Their Time”). They must identify and attract
new  deals,  monitor  existing  deals,  allocate  addi-
tional capital to the most successful deals, and as-
sist with exit options. Astute VCs are able to allo-
cate their time wisely among the various functions
and deals. 

Assuming that each partner has a typical portfo-
lio  of  ten  companies  and  a  2,000-hour  work  year,
the  amount  of  time  spent  on  each  company  with
each  activity  is  relatively  small.  If  the  total  time
spent with portfolio companies serving as directors
and  acting  as  consultants  is  40%,  then  partners
spend 800 hours per year with portfolio companies.
That allows only 80 hours per year per company –
less than 2 hours per week.

The popular image of venture capitalists as sage
advisors is at odds with the reality of their sched-
ules. The ﬁnancial incentive for partners in the VC

136

harvard business review November–December 1998

ﬁrm is to manage as much
money  as  possible.  The
more money they manage,
the less time they have to
nurture  and  advise  entre-
preneurs.  In  fact,  “virtual
CEOs” are now being added
to the equity pool to coun-
sel company management,
which is the role that VCs
used to play. 

Today’s  venture  capital
fund is structurally similar
to its late 1970s and early
1980s  predecessors:  the
partnership  includes  both
limited  and  general  part-
ners,  and  the  life  of  the
fund is seven to ten years. (The fund makes invest-
ments over the course of the ﬁrst two or three years,
and any investment is active for up to ﬁve years. The
fund harvests the returns over the last two to three
years.) However, both the size of the typical fund
and  the  amount  of  money  managed  per  partner
have  changed  dramatically.  In  1980,  the  average
fund  was  about  $20 million,  and  its  two  or  three
general partners each managed three to ﬁve invest-
ments. That left a lot of time for the venture capital
partners  to  work  directly  with  the  companies,
bringing their experience and industry expertise to
bear. Today the average fund is ten times larger, and
each partner manages two to ﬁve times as many in-
vestments. Not surprisingly, then, the partners are
usually far less knowledgeable about the industry
and the technology than the entrepreneurs.

The Upside for Entrepreneurs 
Even though the structure of venture capital deals
seems to put entrepreneurs at a steep disadvantage,
they continue to submit far more plans than actu-
ally get funded, typically by a ratio of more than ten
to one. Why do seemingly bright and capable people
seek such high-cost capital? 

Venture-funded  companies  attract  talented  peo-
ple by appealing to a “lottery” mentality. Despite
the high risk of failure in new ventures, engineers
and  businesspeople  leave  their  jobs  because  they
are  unable  or  unwilling  to  perceive  how  risky  a
start-up can be. Their situation may be compared to
that of hopeful high school basketball players, de-
voting hours to their sport despite the overwhelm-
ing  odds  against  turning  professional  and  earning
million-dollar  incomes.  But  perhaps  the  entrepre-
neur’s behavior is not so irrational.

Consider  the  options.  Entrepreneurs – and  their
friends  and  families – usually  lack  the  funds  to  ﬁ-
nance  the  opportunity.  Many  entrepreneurs  also
recognize the risks in starting their own businesses,
so  they  shy  away  from  using  their  own  money.
Some also recognize that they do not possess all the
talent and skills required to grow and run a success-
ful business.

Most  of  the  entrepreneurs  and  management
teams that start new companies come from corpo-
rations or, more recently, universities. This is logi-
cal  because  nearly  all  basic  research  money,  and
therefore invention, comes from corporate or gov-
ernment funding. But those institutions are better
at  helping  people  ﬁnd  new  ideas  than  at  turning
them  into  new  businesses  (see  the  exhibit  “Who
Else Funds Innovation?”). Entrepreneurs recognize
that  their  upside  in  companies  or  universities  is
limited by the institution’s pay structure. The VC
has no such caps. 

Downsizing  and  reengineering  have  shattered
the  historical  security  of  corporate  employment.
The corporation has shown employees its version
of loyalty. Good employees today recognize the in-
herent insecurity of their positions and, in return,
have little loyalty themselves.

Additionally,  the  United  States  is  unique  in  its
willingness  to  embrace  risk-taking  and  entrepre-
neurship.  Unlike  many  Far  Eastern  and  European
cultures, the culture of the United States attaches
little, if any, stigma to trying and failing in a new
enterprise. Leaving and returning to a corporation
is often rewarded.

For all these reasons, venture capital is an attrac-
tive  deal  for  entrepreneurs.  Those  who  lack  new
ideas,  funds,  skills,  or  tolerance  for  risk  to  start
something alone may be quite willing to be hired

Who Else Funds
Innovation?

The venture model provides an engine for com-
mercializing technologies that formerly lay dor-
mant in corporations and in the halls of acade-
mia. Despite the $133 billion U.S. corporations
spend on R&D, their basic structure makes en-
trepreneurship nearly impossible. Because R&D
relies  on  a  cooperative  and  collaborative  envi-
ronment,  it  is  difficult,  if  not  impossible,  for
companies  to  differentially  reward  employees
working side by side, even if one has a brilliant
idea and the other doesn’t. Compensation typi-
cally comes in the form of status and promotion,
not  money.  It  would  be  an  organizational  and
compensation nightmare for companies to try to
duplicate the venture capital strategy. 

Furthermore,  companies  typically  invest  in
and protect their existing market positions; they
tend to fund only those ideas that are central to
their strategies. The result is a reservoir of talent
and  new  ideas,  which  creates  the  pool  for  new
ventures.

For its part, the government provides two in-
centives  to  develop  and  commercialize  new
technology. The ﬁrst is the patent and trademark
system,  which  provides  monopolies  for  inven-
tive products in return for full disclosure of the
technology. That, in turn, provides a base for fu-
ture technology development. The second is the
direct funding of speculative projects that corpo-
rations and individuals can’t or won’t fund. Such
seed funding is expected to create jobs and boost
the economy.

Although many universities bemoan the fact
that some professors are getting rich from their
research, remember that most of the research is
funded  by  the  government.  From  the  govern-
ment’s  perspective,  that  is  exactly  what  their
$63 billion in R&D funding is intended to do. 

The newest funding source for entrepreneurs
are  so-called  angels,  wealthy  individuals  who
typically  contribute  seed  capital,  advice,  and
support for businesses in which they themselves
are experienced. We estimate that they provide
$20 billion  to  start-ups,  a  far  greater  amount
than  venture  capitalists  do.  Turning  to  angels
may  be  an  excellent  strategy,  particularly  for
businesses in industries that are not currently in
favor among the venture community. But for an-
gels, these investments are a sideline, not a pri-
mary business.

into a well-funded and supported venture. Corporate
and academic training provides many of the tech-
nological and business skills necessary for the task
while venture capital contributes both the ﬁnanc-
ing and an economic reward structure well beyond
what corporations or universities afford. Even if a
founder  is  ultimately  demoted  as  the  company
grows, he or she can still get rich because the value
of the stock will far outweigh the value of any for-
gone salary.

By  understanding  how  venture  capital  actually
works,  astute  entrepreneurs  can  mitigate  their
risks  and  increase  their  potential  rewards.  Many
entrepreneurs  make  the  mistake  of  thinking  that
venture capitalists are looking for good ideas when,
in fact, they are looking for good managers in par-
ticular  industry  segments.  The  value  of  any  indi-
vidual to a VC is thus a function of the following
conditions: 
n the number of people within the high-growth 
industry that are qualiﬁed for the position;
n the position itself (CEO, CFO, VP of R&D, 
technician);
n the match of the person’s skills, reputation, 
and incentives to the VC ﬁrm;
n the willingness to take risks; and
n the ability to sell oneself. 
Entrepreneurs  who  satisfy  these  conditions  come
to the table with a strong negotiating position. The
ideal  candidate  will  also  have  a  business  track
record,  preferably  in  a  prior  successful  IPO,  that
makes the VC comfortable. His reputation will be
such that the investment in him will be seen as a
prudent  risk.  VCs  want  to  invest  in  proven,  suc-
cessful people.

Just like VCs, entrepreneurs need to make their
own assessments of the industry fundamentals, the
skills  and  funding  needed,  and  the  probability  of
success over a reasonably short time frame. Many
excellent entrepreneurs are frustrated by what they
see  as  an  unfair  deal  process  and  equity  position.
They don’t understand the basic economics of the
venture business and the lack of ﬁnancial alterna-
tives available to them. The VCs are usually in the
position of power by being the only source of capi-
tal and by having the ability to inﬂuence the net-
work. But the lack of good managers who can deal
with  uncertainty,  high  growth,  and  high  risk  can
provide  leverage  to  the  truly  competent  entrepre-
neur. Entrepreneurs who are sought after by com-
peting  VCs  would  be  wise  to  ask  the  following
questions:
n Who will serve on our board and what is that 
person’s position in the VC ﬁrm?
n How many other boards does the VC serve on?

harvard business review November–December 1998

n Has the VC ever written and funded his or her
own business plan successfully?
n What, if any, is the VC’s direct operating or 
technical experience in this industry segment?
n What is the ﬁrm’s reputation with entrepreneurs
who have been ﬁred or involved in unsuccessful
ventures?

The VC partner with solid experience and proven
skill is a true “trail-wise sidekick.” Most VCs, how-
ever, have never worked in the funded industry or
have never been in a down cycle. And, unfortunately,
many  entrepreneurs  are  self-absorbed  and  believe
that their own ideas or skills are the key to success.
In fact, the VC’s ﬁnancial and business skills play
an important role in the company’s eventual suc-
cess. Moreover, every company goes through a life
cycle; each stage requires a different set of manage-
ment skills. The person who starts the business is
seldom the person who can grow it, and that person
is seldom the one who can lead a much larger com-
pany. Thus it is unlikely that the founder will be
the same person who takes the company public. 

Ultimately, the entrepreneur needs to show the
venture  capitalist  that  his  team  and  idea  ﬁt  into 
the VC’s current focus and that his equity participa-

h ow   v e n t u r e   c a p i t a l   wo r k s

tion and management skills will make the VC’s job
easier and the returns higher. When the entrepre-
neur understands the needs of the funding source
and sets expectations properly, both the VC and en-
trepreneur can proﬁt handsomely.

Although venture capital has grown dramatically
over  the  past  ten  years,  it  still  constitutes  only  a
tiny part of the U.S. economy. Thus in principle, it
could  grow  exponentially.  More  likely,  however,
the cyclical nature of the public markets, with their
historic booms and busts, will check the industry’s
growth. Companies are now going public with val-
uations in the hundreds of millions of dollars with-
out  ever  making  a  penny.  And  if  history  is  any
guide, most of these companies never will.

The  system  described  here  works  well  for  the
players  it  serves:  entrepreneurs,  institutional  in-
vestors, investment bankers, and the venture capi-
talists themselves. It also serves the supporting cast
of  lawyers,  advisers,  and  accountants.  Whether  it
meets the needs of the investing public is still an
open question.
