The Social Radars (Jessica Livingston and Carolynn Levy) chat with Adora Cheung, Co-founder of Homejoy (YC S10) and now Instalab, an at-home blood testing service that helps you optimize your health by measuring over 60 biomarkers. The conversation is wide-ranging: from how to clean homes efficiently to how she helped defeat Trump in 2020 by getting hundreds of thousands of votes in swing states.
