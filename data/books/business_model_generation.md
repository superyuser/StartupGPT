Customer Segments

The Customer Segments Building Block deﬁ  nes 
the diΩerent groups of people or organizations an 
enterprise aims to reach and serve
Customers comprise the heart of any business model. Without 
(profi table) customers, no company can survive for long. In order 
to better satisfy customers, a company may group them into 
distinct segments with common needs, common behaviors, 
or other attributes. A business model may defi ne one or several 
large or small Customer Segments. An organization must make 
a conscious decision about which segments to serve and which 
segments to ignore. Once this decision is made, a business model 
can be carefully designed around a strong understanding of 
specifi c customer needs.

Customer groups represent separate segments if: 
•  Their needs require and justify a distinct oΩer
•  They are reached through diΩerent Distribution Channels
•  They require diΩerent types of relationships
•  They have substantially diΩerent profi tabilities
•  They are willing to pay for diΩerent aspects of the oΩer

Value Propositions

the bundle of products and services that create 
value for a speciﬁ  c Customer Segment
The Value Proposition is the reason why customers turn to one 
company over another. It solves a customer problem or satisfi es

Channels

The Channels Building Block describes how a 
company communicates with and reaches its 
Customer Segments to deliver a Value Proposition 
Communication, distribution, and sales Channels comprise a 
company's interface with customers. Channels are customer touch 
points that play an important role in the customer experience. 
Channels serve several functions, including:
•  Raising awareness among customers about a company’s 
  products and services
•  Helping customers evaluate a company’s Value Proposition
•  Allowing customers to purchase specifi c products and services
•  Delivering a Value Proposition to customers
•  Providing post-purchase customer support

Customer Relationships

The Customer Relationships Building Block 
describes the types of relationships a company 
establishes with speciﬁ  c Customer Segments 
A company should clarify the type of relationship it wants to 
establish with each Customer Segment. Relationships can range 
from personal to automated. Customer relationships may be 
driven by the following motivations:
•  Customer acquisition 
•  Customer retention 
•  Boosting sales (upselling)

In the early days, for example, mobile network operator Customer 
Relationships were driven by aggressive acquisition strategies 
involving free mobile phones. When the market became saturated, 
operators switched to focusing on customer retention and increas-
ing average revenue per customer. 
  The Customer Relationships called for by a company’s business 
model deeply inﬂ uence the overall customer experience.

Revenue Streams

The Revenue Streams Building Block represents 
the cash a company generates from each Customer 
Segment (costs must be subtracted from revenues to 
create earnings)
If customers comprise the heart of a business model, Revenue 
Streams are its arteries. A company must ask itself, For what value 
is each Customer Segment truly willing to pay? Successfully 
answering that question allows the fi rm to generate one or more 
Revenue Streams from each Customer Segment. Each Revenue 
Stream may have diΩerent pricing mechanisms, such as fi xed list 
prices, bargaining, auctioning, market dependent, volume depen-
dent, or yield management. 

A business model can involve two diΩerent types of Revenue Streams:
1.  Transaction revenues resulting from one-time customer payments
2.  Recurring revenues resulting from ongoing payments to either 
  deliver a Value Proposition to customers or provide post-purchase 
  customer support

Key Resources

The Key Resources Building Block describes 
the most important assets required to make a 
business model work  
Every business model requires Key Resources. These resources 
allow an enterprise to create and oΩer a Value Proposition, reach 
markets, maintain relationships with Customer Segments, and 
earn revenues. DiΩerent Key Resources are needed depending on 
the type of business model. A microchip manufacturer requires 
capital-intensive production facilities, whereas a microchip designer 
focuses more on human resources.
  Key resources can be physical, fi nancial, intellectual, or human. 
Key resources can be owned or leased by the company or acquired 
from key partners.

Cost Structure

The Cost Structure describes all costs incurred to 
operate a business model
This building block describes the most important costs incurred 
while operating under a particular business model. Creating and de-
livering value, maintaining Customer Relationships, and generating 
revenue all incur costs. Such costs can be calculated relatively easily 
after defi ning Key Resources, Key Activities, and Key Partnerships. 
Some business models, though, are more cost-driven than others. 
So-called “no frills” airlines, for instance, have built business models 
entirely around low Cost Structures.

HOW 
DO YOU 
USE THE 
CAnVAS?

I’m using the Business Model Canvas in 
Brazil to help artists, cultural producers, 
and game designers to envision innova-
tive business models for the Cultural 
and Creative Industries. I apply it in the 
Cultural Production MBA at FGV and in 
the Innovation Games Lab at COPPE/
UFRJ Business Incubator.
Claudio D'Ipolitto, Brazil

When you typically think of a business 
model, the conclusion is that it is a 'for 
profit' business. However, I found that 
the Canvas is also very effective in the 
non-profit sector. We used it to  

DESIGN
+ ALIGN

members of the leadership team during 
the formation of a new non-profit  
program. The Canvas was flexible 
enough to take into account the goals  
of this social entrepreneurial venture, 
and bring clarity to the true Value 
Proposition of the business and how  
to make it sustainable.
Kevin Donaldson, United States

I wish I had known the Canvas years 
ago! With a particular tough and 
complicated print-to-digital project 
within the publishing industry it would 
have been so helpful to  

show all project 
members in this 
visual way both  
the big picture,  
their (important) 
own roles in it 
and the inter-
dependencies. 

Hours of explaining, arguing, and mis-
understanding could have been saved. 
Jille Sol, Netherlands

A close friend was looking for a new 
job. I used the Business Model 
Canvas in order to assess her 
personal business model. 
Her core competences and Value 
Proposition were outstanding but  
she failed to leverage her strategic 
partners and develop appropriate 
Customer Relationships. This adjusted 
focus opened new opportunities.
Daniel Pandza, Mexico

The public sector is often challenged  
to implement private sector principles.  
I have used the Canvas to help a 
department view itself as a  service-
oriented business,  
establishing 
externalized as-is 
and to-be business 
models. 
It has created a whole new conversa-
tion around describing and innovating 
the business.
Mike Lachapelle, Canada

I consult with small companies on using 
the freemium business model. This 
model involves giving core products 
away for free, which is very counterin-
tuitive to most businesspeople. Thanks 
to the Business Model Canvas, I can  

easily illustrate 
how it makes 
financial sense.

Peter Froberg, Denmark

I help business owners plan their transi-
tion and exit from their companies. 
Success depends on sustaining long-
term company viability and growth. Key 
to this is a business model innovation 
program. The Canvas helps us identify 
and innovate their business models.

Imagine 60 first-year students, knowing 
nothing about entrepreneurship. In less 
than five days, thanks to the Business 
Model Canvas, they were able to pitch 
a viable idea with conviction and clarity. 
They used it as a tool to cover all the 
startup-building dimensions.
Guilhem Bertholet, France

I use the Business Model Canvas to 
teach early stage entrepreneurs  
across a wide range of industries as  
a much better way to

that they (will) need to operate their 
businesses and to ensure that they are 
focused properly on being customer-
centric in a way that makes the business 
as highly profitable as it can be.
Bob Dunn, United States

I have used the Canvas with a  
co-founder to design a business plan 
for a national level contest held by  
The Economic Times, India. The 
Canvas enabled me to think through 
all the aspects of the startup and put 
together a plan that VCs might find well 
thought out and attractive to fund.
Praveen Singh, India

We were asked to redesign the language 
service of an international nGO. The 
Business Model Canvas was especially 
helpful to show the links between 
the needs of people’s day-to-day 
work and a service that was felt 
too specialized, considered only as an 
afterthought, and far away from their 
priorities.
Paola Valeri, Spain 

As a startup coach I support teams to 
create new products and design their 
businesses. The Business Model Canvas 
does a great job assisting me to  

remind the 
teams to think 
holistically about 
their business 
and prevents 
them from  
getting stuck 
on details. This helps to 

make their new venture a success.
Christian Schüller, Germany 

 The Business Model 
Canvas has allowed 
me to establish a 
common language 
and framework with 
colleagues. 

I've used the Canvas to explore new 
growth opportunities, assess uses  
of new business models by competitors, 
and to communicate across the  
organization how we could  
accelerate technology, market, and  
business model innovations.
Bruce MacVarish, United States

The Business Model Canvas has helped 
several health care organizations in the 
netherlands to make the move from 
a budget driven governmental 
institution to an entrepreneurial 
value-adding organization.
Huub Raemakers, Netherlands

I used the Canvas with senior managers 
of a public company to help them 
restructure their value chain due to 
changes in sector regulation. The key 
success factor was to understand which 
new Value Propositions could be offered 
to their clients and then translated into 
internal operations.
Leandro Jesus, Brazil

51

The Business Model Canvas has proven 
to be a very useful tool for capturing 
ideas and solutions for e-commerce 
projects. Most of my clients are SMEs 
and the Canvas helps them to  
clarify their current 
business models and 
understand and focus on the impact  
of e-commerce on their organizations.
Marc Castricum, Netherlands

I applied the Canvas to help a company 
align key staff in order to determine 
shared goals and strategic priorities, 
which were used during the planning 
process and incorporated with the BSC. 
It also ensured that the chosen initia-
tives were clearly driven by the new 
strategic priorities.
Martin Fanghanel, Bolivia 

 We used 15,000 
post-its and 
more than 
100 meters of 
broWn paper 
to design a future organizational struc-
ture in a global manufacturing company. 
The key of all activities was, however, 
the Business Model Canvas. It con-
vinced us by its practical applicability, 
simplicity, and logical cause-and-effect 
relationships.
Daniel Egger, Brazil

I used the Canvas to do a  

reality 
check 

for my new startup Mupps, a platform 
where artists can make their own music 
apps for iPhone and Android phones  
in minutes. You know what? The Canvas 
made me even surer of the possible 
success! So I gotta go, work to do!

This section describes business models with similar characteristics,  
similar arrangements of business model Building Blocks, or similar  
behaviors. We call these similarities business model patterns. The  
patterns described in the following pages should help you understand 
business model dynamics and serve as a source of inspiration for  
your own work with business models. 

We’ve sketched out five business model patterns built on important  
concepts in the business literature. We’ve “translated” these into  
the language of the Business Model Canvas to make the concepts  
comparable, easy to understand, and applicable. A single business  
model can incorporate several of these patterns.

Concepts upon which our patterns are based include Unbundling,  
the Long Tail, Multi-Sided Platforms, FREE, and Open Business Models.  
New patterns based on other business concepts will certainly emerge 
over time. 

Our goal in defining and describing these business model patterns is  
to recast well-known business concepts in a standardized format—the  
Business Model Canvas—so that they are immediately useful in your  
own work around business model design or invention.

and Marc Singer, who coined 

the term “unbundled corporation,” 

believe that companies are composed of three 

very diΩerent types of businesses with diΩerent 

economic, competitive, and cultural imperatives:

On the 

following pages we 

show how the idea of unbundling 

applies to business models. In the fi rst 

example, we describe the confl icts and 

undesirable trade-oΩs created by a “bundled” 

business model within the private banking 

industry. In the second example we show 

how mobile telecom operators are 

unbundling and focusing on new 

core businesses.

services, while the role of infrastructure businesses is to build 

and manage platforms for high volume, repetitive tasks. Hagel 

and Singer argue that companies should separate these 

businesses and focus on only one of the three internally. 

Because each type of business is driven by diΩerent 

factors, they can confl ict with each other or 

produce undesirable trade-oΩs within the 

same organization.

Trade Offs

1 The bank serves two diΩerent markets with 
very diΩerent dynamics. Advising the wealthy 
is a long-term, relationship-based business. 
Selling fi nancial products to private banks is 
a dynamic, fast-changing business. 

2 The bank aims to sell its products to 
competing banks in order to increase 
revenues—but this creates a confl ict of interest.

3 The bank’s product division pressures advi-
sors to sell the bank’s own products to clients. 
This confl icts with client interest in neutral 
advice. Clients want to invest in the best 
products on the market, regardless of origin.

4 The cost- and eΩiciency-focused transaction 
platform business confl icts with the remuneration-
intensive advisory and fi nancial products business, 
which needs to attract costly talent.

5 The transaction platform business requires 
scale to drive down costs, which is diΩicult to 
achieve within a single bank.

6 The product innovation business is driven 
by speed and quick market entry, which is at 
odds with the long-term business of advising 
the wealthy.

Unbundling the
Mobile Telco

Mobile telecommunication ﬁ rms have started 

unbundling their businesses. Traditionally they 

competed on network quality, but now they are 

striking network sharing deals with competitors 

or outsourcing network operations altogether 

to equipment manufacturers. Why? Because 

they realize that their key asset is no longer the 

network—it is their brand and their Customer 

Relationships.

Unbundled Telco
After unbundling its infrastructure business, a telco can sharpen its focus on 

branding and segmenting customers and services. Customer relationships 

comprise its key asset and its core business. By concentrating on customers 

and increasing share of wallet with current subscribers, it can leverage invest-

ments made over the years acquiring and retaining customers. One of the fi rst 

mobile telcos to pursue strategic unbundling was Bharti Airtel, now one of 

India’s leading telcos. It outsourced network operations to Ericsson and Nokia

creative fi rms. Innovation requires creative talent, which smaller and more 

dynamic organizations typically do a better job of attracting. Telcos work 

with multiple third-parties that assure a constant supply of new technologies, 

services, and media content such as mapping, games, video, and music. Two 

examples are Mobilizy of Austria and Sweden’s tat. Mobilizy focuses on 

location-based service solutions for smartphones (it developed a popular mobile 

travel guide), and tat concentrates on creating advanced mobile user interfaces.

long tail business models are about selling less 

of more: They focus on oΩering a large number 

of niche products, each of which sells relatively 

infrequently. • Aggregate sales of niche items 

can be as lucrative as the traditional model 

whereby a small number of bestsellers account 

for most revenues. • Long Tail business models 

require low inventory costs and strong plat-

forms to make niche content readily available 

to interested buyers.

Old Model
We’ve all heard about aspiring authors who carefully craft and submit 

manuscripts to publishing houses in the hope of seeing their work in 

print—and face constant rejection. This stereotypical image of publishers 

and authors holds much truth. The traditional book publishing model 

is built on a process of selection whereby publishers screen many authors 

-

and manuscripts and select those that seem most likely to achieve mini-

mum sales targets. Less promising authors and their titles are rejected 

because it would be unproﬁ table to copyedit, design, print, and promote 

books that sell poorly. Publishers are most interested in books they can 

print in quantity for sale to large audiences.

A New Model
Lulu.com turned the traditional bestseller-centric publishing model on 

its head by enabling anyone to publish. Lulu.com’s business model is 

based on helping niche and amateur authors bring their work to market. 

It eliminates traditional entry barriers by providing authors the tools to 

craft, print, and distribute their work through an online marketplace. This 

-

contrasts strongly with the traditional model of selecting “market-worthy” 

work. In fact, the more authors Lulu.com attracts, the more it succeeds, 

because authors become customers. In a nutshell, Lulu.com is a multi-

sided platform (see p. 76) that serves and connects authors and readers 

with a Long Tail of user-generated niche content. Thousands of authors 

use Lulu.com’s self-service tools to publish and sell their books. This 

works because books are printed only in response to actual orders. The 

failure of a particular title to sell is irrelevant to Lulu.com, because such 

a failure incurs no costs.

multi-sided platforms bring together two or 

more distinct but interdependent groups of 

customers. • Such platforms are of value to  

one group of customers only if the other groups 

of customers are also present. • The platform  

creates value by facilitating interactions between 

the diΩerent groups. • A multi-sided platform

Sony and Microsoft competed with costly, proprietary, state-of-the-art

share and keep hardware prices aΩordable. Nintendo, on the other hand, 

focused on a market segment that was far less sensitive to technological

Apple’s Evolution into 
a Platform Operator

The evolution of Apple’s product line from the iPod to the iPhone high-

lights the company’s transition to a powerful platform business model 

pattern. The iPod was initially a stand-alone device. The iPhone, on the 

contrary, evolved into a powerful multi-sided platform for which Apple 

controls third party applications through its App Store.

Business models with a

have a distinct structure. 
They have two or more 
customer segments, each 
of which has its own Value 
Proposition and associated 
Revenue Stream. Moreover, 
one Customer Segment can-

Each Customer Segment 
produces a diΩerent

Receiving something free of charge has always 

been an attractive Value Proposition.  Any marketer or 

economist will confirm that the demand generated at a price of zero 

is many times higher than the demand generated at one cent or any other price 

point. In recent years free offers have exploded, particularly over the Internet. The ques-

tion, of course, is how can you systematically offer something for free and still earn substantial 

revenues? Part of the answer is that the cost of producing certain giveaways, such as online data storage 

capacity, has fallen dramatically. Yet to make a profit, an organization offering free products or services must 

still generate revenues somehow. 

There are several patterns that make integrating free products and services into a business model possible. Some of the tra-

ditional FREE patterns are well known, such as advertising, which is based on the previously discussed pattern of multi-sided 

platforms (see p. 76). Others, such as the so-called freemium model, which provides basic services free of charge and premium 

services for a fee, have become popular in step with the increasing digitization of goods and services offered via the Web. 

Chris Anderson, whose Long Tail concept we discussed previously (see p. 66), has helped the concept of FREE gain widespread 

recognition. Anderson shows that the rise of new free-of-charge offers is closely related to the fundamentally different econom-

ics of digital products and services. For example, creating and recording a song costs an artist time and money, but the cost of 

digitally replicating and distributing the work over the Internet is close to zero. Hence, an artist can promote and deliver music 

to a global audience over the Web, as long as he or she finds other Revenue Streams, such as concerts and merchandis-

ing, to cover costs. Bands and artists who have experimented successfully with free music include Radiohead and Trent 

Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.

In this section we look at three different patterns that make FREE a viable business model option. Each 

has different underlying economics, but all share a common trait: at least one Customer Segment 

continuously benefits from the free-of-charge offer. The three patterns are (1) free offer based 

on multi-sided platforms (advertising-based), (2) free basic services with optional 

premium services (the so-called “freemium” model), (3) and the “bait & 

hook” model whereby a free or inexpensive initial offer lures 

customers into repeat purchases.

platform pattern (see p. 76). One side of the 

platform is designed to attract users with free 

content, products, or services. Another side of 

the platform generates revenue by selling space 

to advertisers. 

  One striking example of this pattern is Metro, 

the free newspaper that started in Stockholm 

and is now available in dozens of cities around 

the world. The genius of Metro lies in how it 

modiﬁ ed the traditional daily newspaper model. 

First, it offered the paper for free. Second, it 

focused on distributing in high-trafﬁ c com-

muter zones and public transport networks by 

hand and with self-service racks. This required 

Metro to develop its own distribution network, 

but enabled the company to quickly achieve 

broad circulation. Third, it cut editorial costs to 

produce a paper just good enough to entertain 

younger commuters during their short rides

The term “freemium” was coined by Jarid

Fred Wilson on his blog. It stands for business 

models, mainly Web-based, that blend free 

basic services with paid premium services. The 

freemium model is characterized by a large user

base beneﬁ ting from a free, no-strings-attached 

offer. Most of these users never become paying 

customers; only a small portion, usually less 

than 10 percent of all users, subscribe to the paid 

premium services. This small base of paying 

users subsidizes the free users. This is possible 

because of the low marginal cost of serving addi-

tional free users. In a freemium model, the key 

metrics to watch are (1) the average cost of serv-

Skype

Skype offers an intriguing example of a free-

mium pattern that disrupted the telecommuni-

cations sector by enabling free calling services 

via the Internet. Skype developed software by 

the same name that, when installed on comput-

ers or smartphones, enables users to make calls 

from one device to another free of charge. 

Skype can offer this because its Cost Structure 

is completely different from that of a telecom 

carrier. Free calls are fully routed through 

the Internet based on so-called peer-to-peer 

technology that employs user hardware and 

the Internet as communications infrastructure. 

Hence, Skype does not have to manage its own 

network like a telco and incurs only minor costs

Skype disrupted the telecommunications 
industry and helped drive voice communica-
tion costs close to zero. Telecom operators 
initially didn’t understand why Skype would 
offer calls for free and didn’t take the company 
seriously. What’s more, only a tiny fraction 
of the traditional carriers’ customers used 
Skype. But over time more and more customers 
decided to make their international calls with 
Skype, eating into one of the most lucrative 
carrier revenue sources. This pattern, typical of 
a disruptive business model, severely affected 
the traditional voice communication business, 
and today Skype is the world’s largest provider 
of cross-border voice communication services, 
according to telecommunications research 
fi rm Telegeography.

Many paying users

In the freemium model a small base of customers 

paying for a premium service subsidizes a large 

base of non-paying customers. The insurance 

model is actually the opposite—it’s the freemium 

model turned on its head. In the insurance 

model, a large base of customers pay small regu-

lar fees to protect themselves from unlikely—

but ﬁ nancially devastating—events. In short, a 

large base of paying customers subsidizes a small 

group of people with actual claims—but any 

one of the paying customers could at any time 

become part of the beneﬁ ciary group.

  Let’s look at REGA as an example. REGA 

is a Swiss non-proﬁ t organization that uses 

helicopters and airplanes to transport medical 

staff to the scene of accidents, notably in the 

mountainous areas of Switzerland. Over two 

million so-called “patrons” ﬁ nance the organiza-

tion. In return, patrons are exempt from paying 

any costs arising from being rescued by REGA. 

Mountain rescue operations can be extremely 

expensive, so REGA patrons ﬁ nd the service 

attractive in protecting them against the high 

cost of accidents during skiing vacations, sum-

mer hikes, or mountain drives.

“Bait & hook” refers to a business model pattern 

characterized by an attractive, inexpensive, or 

free initial offer that encourages continuing 

KP

future purchases of related products or services. 

This pattern is also known  as the “loss leader” 

or “razor & blades” model. “Loss leader” refers 

to a subsidized, even money-losing initial offer 

with the intention of generating proﬁ ts from 

subsequent purchases. “Razor & blades” refers 

to a business model popularized by an American 

device 
manufacturers

businessman, King C. Gillette, inventor of the 

disposable razor blade (see p. 105). We use the 

C$

term bait & hook pattern to describe the general 

idea of luring customers with an initial offering, 

while earning from follow-up sales.

  The mobile telecommunications industry 

provides a good illustration of the bait & hook 

pattern with a free offer. It is now standard 

practice for mobile network operators to offer 

free telephone handsets bundled with service 

subscriptions. Operators initially lose money 

by giving away mobile phones for free, but 

they easily cover the loss through subsequent 

monthly service fees. Operators provide instant 

gratiﬁ cation with a free offer that later gener-

ates recurring income.

The form of the bait & hook pattern known as 

the razor and blades model derives from the 

way the ﬁ rst disposable razors were sold. In 

1904 King C. Gillette, who commercialized the 

ﬁ rst disposable razor blade system, decided to 

sell razor handles at a steep discount or even 

give them away with other products in order to 

create demand for his disposable blades. Today 

Gillette is still the preeminent brand in shaving 

products. The key to this model is the close link

Procter & Gamble: 
Connect & Develop

In June of 2000, amid a continuing slide in 

Procter & Gamble’s share price, longtime P&G 

executive A.G. Laﬂ ey got the call to become the 

consumer product giant’s new CEO. To rejuve-

nate P&G, Laﬂ ey resolved to put innovation back 

at the company’s core. But instead of boosting 

R&D spending, he focused on structuring a 

new innovation culture: one that moved from 

an internally focused R&D approach to an open 

R&D process. A key element was a “Connect & 

Develop” strategy aimed at exploiting internal 

research through outside partnerships. Laﬂ ey 

set an ambitious goal: create 50 percent of P&G’s 

innovations with outside partners at a time when 

that ﬁ gure was closer to 15 percent. The com-

pany surpassed that goal in 2007. Meanwhile, 

R&D productivity had soared 85 percent, even 

though R&D spending was only modestly higher 

compared to when Laﬂ ey took over as CEO. 

In order to link its internal resources and 

R&D activities with the outside world, Procter 

& Gamble built three “bridges” into its busi-

ness model: technology entrepreneurs, Internet 

platforms, and retirees. 

1 Technology entrepreneurs are senior scien-
tists from P&G business units who systemati-
cally develop relationships with researchers 
at universities and other companies. They also 
act as “hunters” who scan the outside world 
for solutions to internal P&G challenges. 

2 Through Internet platforms, P&G connects 
with expert problem-solvers around the world. 
Platforms such as InnoCentives (see p. 114) 
allow P&G to expose some of its research prob-
lems to non-P&G scientists around the globe.
Respondents earn cash prizes for developing 
successful solutions.

3 P&G solicits knowledge from retirees 
through YourEncore.com, a platform the com-
pany launched specifi cally to serve as an open 
innovation “bridge” to the outside world.

Unused internal ideas, 
R&D, and intellectual 
property related to 
diseases in poor nations 
have substantial value 
when “pooled”

The inside-out approach to open innova-

tion ordinarily focuses on monetizing unused 

internal assets, primarily patents and technol-

ogy. In the case of GlaxoSmithKline’s “patent 

pool” research strategy, though, the motivation 

was slightly diΩerent. The company’s goal was 

to make drugs more accessible in the world’s 

poorest countries and to facilitate research 

into understudied diseases. One way to achieve 

this was to place intellectual property rights 

relevant to developing drugs for such diseases 

into a patent pool open to exploration by other 

researchers. Since pharmaceutical companies 

focus mainly on developing blockbuster drugs, 

intellectual property related to less-studied 

diseases often lies idle. Patent pools aggregate 

intellectual property from diΩerent rights-

holders and makes it more accessible. This helps 

prevent R&D advances from being blocked by 

a single rights-holder.

Taking advantage of outside

It costs money to acquire 
innovation from outside 
sources. But by building on 
externally-created knowl-
edge and advanced research 
programs, a company can 
shorten time-to-market and 
increase its internal R&D 
productivity.

Established companies with 
strong brands, strong Distribution

Relationships are well suited to 
an outside-in open business model. 
They can leverage existing Customer

Organizations with 
substantial internal R&D 
operations typically possess 
much unutilized knowledge, 
technology, and intellectual 
property. Due to sharp focus 
on core businesses, some 
of these otherwise valuable 
intellectual assets sit idle. 
Such businesses are good 
candidates for an "inside-
out" open business model.

By enabling others to exploit 
unused internal ideas, 
a company adds “easy” 
additional revenue streams.

This section describes a number of techniques and tools from the world  
of design that can help you design better and more innovative business 
models. A designer’s business involves relentless inquiry into the best pos-
sible way to create the new, discover the unexplored, or achieve the func-
tional. A designer’s job is to extend the boundaries of thought, to generate 
new options, and, ultimately, to create value for users. This requires the 
ability to imagine “that which does not exist.” We are convinced that the 
tools and attitude of the design profession are prerequisites for success in 
the business model generation. 

Businesspeople unknowingly practice design every day. We design orga-
nizations, strategies, business models, processes, and projects. To do this, 
we must take into account a complex web of factors, such as competitors, 
technology, the legal environment, and more. Increasingly, we must do so in 
unfamiliar, uncharted territory. This is precisely what design is about. What 
businesspeople lack are design tools that complement their business skills. 

The following pages explore six business model design techniques:  
Customer Insights, Ideation, Visual Thinking, Prototyping, Storytelling, and 
Scenarios. We introduce each technique with a story, then demonstrate 
how the technique applies to business model design. Here and there we've 
added exercises and suggestions for workshop activities that show you 
specifically how the design technique can be applied. Book references are 
provided at the end for those interested in exploring each technique in 
more depth.

nearly every mobile phone sports a camera, photo sharing is of 

keen interest to cellular operators. Ling’s research will help Telenor 

capture the “big picture” of photo sharing. He focuses not just on 

existing and potential new mobile photo sharing services, but on 

broader issues, such as the role photo-sharing plays with respect 

to trust, secrecy, group identity, and the social fabric linking these 

young men. Ultimately, his work will enable Telenor to design

As pioneering automaker Henry Ford once said, “If 

I had asked my customers what they wanted, they 

would have told me ‘a faster horse.’”

Another challenge lies in knowing which cus-

tomers to heed and which customers to ignore. 

Sometimes tomorrow’s growth segments wait 

at the periphery of today’s cash cows. Therefore 

business model innovators should avoid focusing 

exclusively on existing Customer Segments and 

set their sights on new or unreached segments. 

A number of business model innovations have 

succeeded precisely because they satisfied the 

unmet needs of new customers. For example, 

Stelios Haji-Ioannou’s easyJet made air travel 

available to lower- and middle-income customers 

who rarely flew. And Zipcar allowed city dwellers 

to eliminate the hassles of metropolitan car owner-

ship. Instead, customers who pay an annual fee can 

rent automobiles by the hour. Both are examples of 

new business models built on Customer Segments 

located at the periphery under incumbent models: 

traditional air travel and traditional car rentals.

Understanding a B2B customer 
using the Empathy Map

In October 2008, Microsoft announced plans to provide 

its entire suite of OΩice applications online. According 

to the announcement, customers will eventually be able 

to use Word, Excel, and all other OΩice applications 

through browsers. This will require Microsoft to signifi -

cantly reengineer its business model. One starting point 

for this business model renovation could be to create a 

customer profi le for a key buying segment: chief informa-

tion oΩicers (CIO), who defi ne IT strategy and make 

overarching purchasing decisions. What might a CIO 

customer profi le look like?

The goal is to create a customer viewpoint for continu-

ously questioning your business model assumptions. 

Customer profi ling enables you to generate better 

answers to questions such as: Does this Value Proposition 

solve real customer problems? Would she really be willing 

to pay for this? How would she like to be reached?

. . . Peter works for a pharmaceutical group that has hired Elmar’s 

innovation consultancy, Creaholic, to help with a breakthrough 

product. The two men are part of a six-person innovation team 

holding a three-day offsite meeting. 

The group is deliberately heterogeneous, a pastiche of differ-

ent experience levels and backgrounds. Though all members are 

accomplished specialists, they joined the group not as technicians, 

but as consumers unsatisfi ed with the current state of affairs. 

Creaholic instructed them to leave their expertise at the door and 

carry it with them only as a “backpack” of distant memories. 

For three days the six form a consumer microcosm and 

unleash their imaginations to dream up potential breakthrough 

solutions to a problem, unbridled by technical or fi nancial 

constraints. Ideas collide and new thinking emerges, and only 

after generating a multitude of potential solutions are they asked 

to recall their expertise and pin down the three most promising 

candidates. 

Elmar Mock boasts a long track record of breakthrough inno-

vation. He is one of two inventors of the legendary Swatch watch. 

Since then, he and his team at Creaholic have helped companies 

such as BMW, Nestlé, Mikron, and Givaudan innovate success-

fully. 

Elmar knows how diffi cult it is for established companies to 

innovate. Such fi rms require predictability, job descriptions, and 

fi nancial projections. Yet real innovations emerge from something 

better described as systematic chaos. Creaholic has found a 

way to master that chaos. Elmar and his team are obsessed by 

innovation.

resource-driven innovations originate from 
an organization’s existing infrastructure 
or partnerships to expand or transform the 
business model.

offer-driven innovations create new value 
propositions that affect other business 
model building blocks.

The Power of “What If” Questions

I

n
o
t
a
e
d

I

We often have trouble conceiving innovative business 

models because we are held back in our thinking by the 

status quo. The status quo stifl es imagination. One way 

to overcome this problem is to challenge conventional 

140

140

assumptions with “what if” questions. With the right 

business model ingredients, what we think of as impos-

sible might be just doable. “What if” questions help 

us break free of constraints imposed by current models. 

n
g
I
s
e
d

They should provoke us and challenge our thinking. 

They should disturb us as intriguing, diffi cult-to-execute 

propositions. 

Managers of a daily newspaper might ask themselves: 

What if we stopped our print edition and went to 

entirely digital distribution, through Amazon’s Kindle 

e-book reader or through the Web? This would allow the 

newspaper to drastically reduce production and logistics 

costs, but would require making up lost print advertising 

revenues and transitioning readers to digital Channels. 

“What if” questions are merely starting points. They 

challenge us to discover the business model that could 

make their suppositions work. Some “what if” questions 

may remain unanswered because they are too provoca-

tive. Some may simply need the right business model to 

become reality.

The ideation process can take several forms. Here we outline a general approach 

to producing innovative business model options:

1. team composition

business model ideas?

ideas. Members should be diverse in terms of seniority, age, experience level, business

tion time, revenue potential, possible customer resistance, and impact on competitive 

2. immersion

Key question: Which elements must we study before generating 
business model ideas?

Ideally the team should go through an immersion phase. which could include general 

research, studying customers or prospects, scrutinizing new technologies, or assessing 

existing business models. Immersion could last several weeks or could be as short as a 

couple of workshop exercises (e.g. the Empathy Map). 

3. expanding

Key question: What innovations can we imagine for each business 
model building block?

During this phase the team expands the range of possible solutions, aiming to generate 

as many ideas as possible. Each of the nine business model building blocks can serve as 

a starting point. The goal of this phase is quantity, not quality. Enforcing brainstorming 

rules will keep people focused on generating ideas rather than on critiquing too early in 

the process (see p. 144). 

advantage.

5. “prototyping”

Key question: What does the complete business model for each 
shortlisted idea look like?

With criteria defi ned, the team should be able to reduce the number of ideas to a 

prioritized shortlist of three to fi ve potential business model innovations. Use the 

Business Model Canvas to sketch out and discuss each idea as a business model 

prototype (see p. 160).

That’s why assembling the right task force is a critical prerequisite for generating 

new business model ideas. Thinking about business model innovation should not be 

confi ned to the R&D unit or the strategic planning offi ce. Business model innova-

tion teams should have a diverse membership. The diversity will help you generate, 

discuss, and select new ideas. Consider adding outsiders, or even children. Diversity 

works. But make sure to teach people how to listen actively, and consider engaging 

a neutral facilitator for key meetings.

stray too far; always bring it back to the problem statement.

Enforce rules

Clarify the brainstorming rules upfront and enforce them. The most 

important rules are "defer judgment," "one conversation at a time," 

"go for quantity," "be visual," and "encourage wild ideas."  Facilitators 

should enforce the rules.

Think visually

Write ideas down or sketch them out on a surface everyone can see. A 

good way to collect ideas is to jot them down on Post-it™ notes and stick 

these to a wall. This allows you to move ideas around and regroup them.

Prepare 

Prepare for brainstorming with some sort of immersion experience 

related to the problem at hand. This could be a fi eld trip, discussions with 

customers, or any other means of immersing the team in issues related 

to your problem statement.

  Dave Gray, founder and chairman of consultancy XPLANE, 

is facilitating the meeting. XPLANE uses visual thinking tools 

to help clients clarify problems involving everything from 

corporate strategy to operational implementations. Together 

with an XPLANE artist, Dave helps the 14 HP specialists gain 

a better understanding of the big picture of information sharing 

in a global enterprise. The group uses the posted sketches 

to discuss information sharing, to identify relationships 

between elements, to fi ll in missing pieces, and to develop a 

joint understanding of multiple issues. 

  With a knowing smile, Dave talks about a common miscon-

ception: that one shouldn’t draw something until one under-

stands it. On the contrary, he explains, sketches—however 

rudimentary or amateurish—help people better describe, discuss, 

and understand issues, particularly those of a complex nature. 

For the 14 Hewlett-Packard collaborators, XPLANE’s visualization 

approach has worked beautifully. They gathered as 14 specialists 

with deeply individual understandings, but parted with a simple 

one-page image of how a global enterprise should manage infor-

mation. XPLANE’s client roster, which reads like a who’s who of 

the world’s most successful companies, testifi es to the growing 

number of organizations that understand the value of this type of 

visual thinking.

A set of Post-it™ notes is an indispensable tool that everyone refl ecting on business 

models should keep handy. Post-it™ notes function like idea containers that can be added, 

removed, and easily shifted between business model building blocks. This is important 

because during business model discussions, people frequently do not immediately agree 

on which elements should appear in a Business Model Canvas or where they should be 

placed. During exploratory discussions, some elements might be removed and replaced 

multiple times to explore new ideas. 

Here are three simple guidelines: (1) use thick marking pens, (2) write only one element 

per Post-it™ note, and (3) write only a few words per note to capture the essential point. 

Using thick markers is more than a detail: it prevents you from putting too much informa-

tion on a single Post-it™, and makes for easier reading and overview. 

Keep in mind, too, that the discussion leading to the fi nal business model picture created 

by all the Post-it™ notes is just as important as the outcome. Discussion around which 

notes to place on or remove from the Canvas and debate over how one element infl uences 

others give participants a deep understanding of the business model and its dynamics. 

Consequently, a Post-it™ note becomes more than just a piece of sticky paper represent-

ing a business model building block; it becomes a vector for strategic discussion.

A powerful way to explain a business model is to tell a story one image at a time. 

Presenting a full description within the Business Model Canvas can overwhelm an 

audience. It’s better to introduce the model piece by piece. You could do this by drawing 

one piece after another, or by using PowerPoint. An appealing alternative is to pre-draw 

all the elements of a business model on Post-it™ notes, then put them up one after 

another as you explain the model. It allows the audience to follow the build-up of the 

model, and the visuals complement your explanation.

•  Begin by mapping out a simple, text-

•  Mapping can be done individually

•  One at a time, take each Post-it™ 
note and replace it with a drawing 
representing the content. 

•  Keep the images simple: omit detail.  

•  Try different paths. You might start 
with Customer Segments, or maybe 
the Value Proposition. 

•  Drawing quality is unimportant as 
long as the message is conveyed.

•  Basically, any starting point is possible 
if it effectively supports your story.

Note: Depending on the context and 
your personal preferences, you may

Su mm er,  2000

With a look bordering 
on panic, Weatherhead 
School of Management 
Professor Richard 
Boland Jr. watched as 
Matt Fineout, an 
architect with Gehry 
& Associates, casually 
tore up plans for a new 
school building . . .

. . . Boland and Fineout had been struggling for two full days to 

remove some 5,500 square feet from the fl oor plan designed by 

star architect Frank Gehry, while leaving room needed for meeting 

spaces and offi ce equipment. 

  At the end of the marathon planning session, Boland had 

breathed a sigh of relief. “It’s fi nally done,” he thought. But at that 

very moment, Fineout rose from his chair, ripped the document 

apart, and tossed the scraps into a trash bin, not bothering to 

retain a single  trace of the pair’s hard labor. He responded to 

Professor Boland's shocked expression with a gentle shrug and a 

soft remark. “We’ve shown we can do it; now we need to think 

of how we want to do it.” 

Looking back, Boland describes the incident as an extreme 

example of the relentless approach to inquiry he experienced 

while working with the Gehry group on the new Weatherhead 

building. During the design phase, Gehry and his team made hun-

dreds of models with different materials and of varying sizes, sim-

ply to explore new directions. Boland explains that the goal of this 

prototyping activity was far more than the mere testing or proving 

of ideas. It was a methodology for exploring different possibilities 

until a truly good one emerged. He points out that prototyping, as 

practiced by the Gehry group, is a central part of an inquiry pro-

cess that helps participants gain a better sense of what is missing 

in the initial understanding of a situation. This leads to completely 

new possibilities, among which the right one can be identifi ed. 

For Professor Boland, the experience with Gehry & Associates 

was transformative. He now understands how design techniques, 

including prototyping, contribute to fi nding better solutions for 

the entire spectrum of business problems. Together with fellow 

professor Fred Collopy and other colleagues, Boland is now spear-

heading the concept of Manage by Designing: the integration of 

design thinking, skills, and experiences into Weatherhead’s MBA 

curriculum. Here, students use tools of design to sketch alterna-

tives, follow through on problem situations, transcend traditional 

boundaries, and prototype ideas.

Businesspeople are likely to display one of two reactions to this 

process of business model inquiry. Some might say, "Well, that 

is a nice idea, if we only had the time to explore different options." 

Others might say that a market research study would be an 

equally good way to come up with new business models. Both 

reactions are based on dangerous preconceptions. 

The fi rst supposes that “business as usual” or incremental 

improvements are suffi cient to survive in today’s competitive 

environment. We believe this path leads to mediocrity. Businesses

The second reaction assumes that data is the most important 

consideration when designing new strategic options. It is not. 

Market research is a single input in the long and laborious process 

of prototyping powerful new business models with the potential 

to outperform competitors or develop entirely new markets. 

Where do you want to be? At the top of the game, because you’ve 

taken the time to prototype powerful new business models? 

Or on the sidelines, because you were too busy sustaining your 

existing model? We're convinced that new, game-changing 

business models emerge from deep and relentless inquiry.

Design Attitude

“If you freeze an idea too quickly, you fall in love with it. 
If you refi ne it too quickly, you become attached to it 
and it becomes very hard to keep exploring, to keep 
looking for better. The crudeness of the early models 
in particular is very deliberate.”

  Such comments alarm John, because he 

believes his industry employs some of the brightest 

minds in business. After much thought, he has con-

own company’s approach. John aims to make hourly

sure how to do so. 

  Help John by providing him with some fresh per-

spectives on innovative consulting business models.

Colebrook Bosson Saunders, a designer and 

manufacturer of award-winning oΩice furniture 

accessories. Anab is a storyteller and designer, 

and the fi lms she is working on are part of a 

project to help Colebrook Bosson Saunders make 

sense of how the future of work and the work-

place could look. To make this future tangible, she 

invented three protagonists and projected them 

into 2012. She gave them new jobs based on 

research into new and emerging technologies and 

the impact of demographics and environmental 

risks on our future lives. The fi lms then show 

this near future. But rather than describing 2012, 

Anab takes the role of the storyteller, visiting this 

future environment and interviewing the three 

protagonists. They each explain their work and 

show objects they use. The fi lms are real enough 

to cause viewers to suspend their disbelief and 

become intrigued by the diΩerent environment. 

That is exactly what companies that hire Anab 

Jain, like Microsoft and Nokia, are looking for: 

stories to make potential futures tangible.

in the world of business. Let’s examine how storytelling can serve 

as a powerful tool to make new business models more tangible. 

By their very nature, new or innovative business models can be 

diffi cult to describe and understand. They challenge the status 

quo by arranging things in unfamiliar ways. They force listeners 

to open their minds to new possibilities. Resistance is one likely 

reaction to an unfamiliar model. Therefore, describing new busi-

ness models in a way that overcomes resistance is crucial.

Making Business Models Tangible?

The goal of telling a story is to introduce a new business model in an engaging, 

tangible way. Keep the story simple and use only one protagonist. Depending on 

the audience, you can use a different protagonist with a different perspective. 

Here are two possible starting points.

perspective

Employee Observer

Explain the business model in the form of a story told 

from an employee’s perspective. Use the employee as the 

protagonist who demonstrates why the new model makes 

sense. This may be because the employee frequently 

observes customer problems that the new business model 

solves. Or it may be that the new model makes better or 

different use of resources, activities, or partnerships com-

pared to the old model (e.g. cost reduction, productivity 

improvement, new revenue sources, etc.). In such a story, 

the employee embodies the inner workings of an organiza-

tion and its business model and shows the reasons for 

transitioning to a new model.  

customer
perspective

Customer Jobs

The customer perspective provides a powerful starting 

point for a story. Cast a customer as the protagonist and 

tell the tale from her point of view. Show the challenges 

she faces and which jobs she must get done. Then outline 

how your organization creates value for her. The story can 

describe what she receives, how it fi ts into her life, and 

what she is willing to pay for. Add some drama and emotion 

to the story, and describe how your organization is making 

her life easier. Ideally, weave in how your organization gets 

these jobs done for the customer, with which resources and 

through which activities. The biggest challenge with stories 

told from a customer perspective is keeping them authentic 

and avoiding a facile or patronizing tone.

Making the Future Tangible

Stories offer a wonderful technique for blurring the lines 

separating reality and fi ction. Thus stories provide a 

powerful tool for imparting tangibility to different versions 

of the future. This can help you challenge the status quo 

or justify adopting a new business model. 

what future business model?

current business model

Provoke Ideas

Sometimes a story’s sole purpose is to challenge the 

organizational status quo. Such a story must bring vividly 

to life a future competitive environment in which the 

current business model is severely challenged or even 

obsolete. Telling a story like this blurs the lines between

reality and fi ction and catapults listeners into the future.

This suspends disbelief, instills a sense of urgency, and 

opens the audience’s eyes to the need to generate new 

business models. Such a story can be told from either an

Sometimes an organization has strong ideas about how

its competitive landscape will evolve. In this context, 

a story’s purpose is to show how a new business model 

is ideally suited to help an organization compete in the 

new landscape. Stories temporarily suspend disbelief 

and help people imagine how the current business model 

should evolve to remain effective in the future. The 

story’s protagonist could be a customer, an employee, 

or a top manager.

. . . Huang and Waldvogel were brought in to 

conceive the architectural design of the building, 

which, rather than issuing visas, will serve as a 

networking and knowledge exchange hub. The 

two are studying several scenarios of how people 

will use the Swisshouse, and have constructed 

both physical models and screenplay-like texts 

designed to make tangible the purpose of this 

unprecedented government facility. 

  One scenario describes Nicolas, a brain 

surgeon who has just moved to Boston from 

Switzerland. He visits the Swisshouse to meet 

likeminded scientists and other members of the 

Swiss-American community. A second scenario 

tells the story of a Professor Smith, who uses 

the Swisshouse to present his MIT Media Lab 

research to Boston’s Swiss community and to 

academics at two Swiss universities, using a 

high-speed Internet connection. 

These scenarios, while simple, are the result 

of intensive research into roles the new type of 

consulate might play. The stories illustrate the 

Swiss government’s intentions and serve as think-

ing tools to guide the building’s design. Ultimately, 

the new facility effectively accommodated the 

applications imagined and fulfi lled its objectives. 

Today, almost a decade after its conception, 

the Swisshouse enjoys an outstanding reputa-

tion for helping build stronger international 

ties in greater Boston’s science and technology 

communities. Under the banner of the Swiss 

Knowledge Network, or swissnex, the Swisshouse 

has inspired “colleague” facilities in Bangalore, 

San Francisco, Shanghai, and Singapore.

Scenario-Guided 
Business Model Design 
—

Scenarios can be useful in guiding the design of new business 

ments. The strategy literature discusses this practice in detail 

models or innovating around existing models. Like visual thinking 

under the topic of “scenario planning.”  Applying scenario 

(p. 146), prototyping (p. 160), and storytelling (p. 170), scenarios 

planning techniques to business model innovation forces 

render the abstract tangible. For our purposes, their primary 

refl ection on how a model might have to evolve under certain 

function is to inform the business model development process 

conditions. This sharpens understanding of the model, and of 

by making the design context specifi c and detailed.

prepare for the future. 

Here we discuss two types of scenarios. The fi rst describes differ-

ent customer settings: how products or services are used, what 

kinds of customers use them, or customer concerns, desires, and 

objectives. Such scenarios build on customer insights (p. 126), 

but go a step further by incorporating knowledge about custom-

ers into a set of distinct, concrete images. By describing a specifi c 

situation, a customer scenario makes customer insights tangible. 

A second type of scenario describes future environments 

in which a business model might compete. The goal here is 

not to predict the future, but rather to imagine possible 

futures in concrete detail. This exercise helps innova-

improved diagnostic tools and a better understanding of 

the links between diseases and individual genetic profi les. 

These two trends—the rise of personalized drugs 

and the increasing importance of prevention—have 

completely transformed the traditional pharmaceutical 

manufacturing business model. The twin trends have 

had a dramatic impact on pharma’s Key Resources and 

Activities. They’ve transformed the way drug makers 

approach customers and provoked substantial changes 

in how revenue is generated.

The new pharma landscape has taken a heavy toll on 

incumbents. A number were unable to adapt quickly 

enough and disappeared or were acquired by more agile 

players. At the same time, upstarts with innovative 

business models were able to acquire signifi cant market 

share. Some were themselves acquired and integrated 

into the operations of larger but less nimble companies.

In my work with non-profit organiza-
tions, the biggest obstacles to business 
model innovation are 1. inability 
to understand the existing business 
model, 2. lack of a language to talk 
about business model innovation,  
and 3. counterproductive constraints 
on imagining the design of new  
business models.
Jeff De Cagna, United States

The management of an SME (wood 
manufacturing industry-WMI) did not 
begin changing its business model 
until the bank no longer wanted to give 
them credit. The biggest obstacle to 
business model innovation (in the WMI 
case and likely every case) is the people 
who resist any changes until problems 
appear and need corrective actions.

The biggest obstacle to business  
model innovation is not technology:  
it is we humans and the institutions  
we live in. Both are stubbornly resistant  
to experimentation and change.
Saul Kaplan, United States

I have found that the management 
and key employees in many SME 
companies lack a common framework 
and language for discussing business 
model innovation. They do not have the 
theoretical background, but they are  
essential to the process because they 
are the ones who know the business.
Michael N. Wilkens, Denmark

 METRICS 
OF SUCCESS: 

They can direct the scope and ambition 
of behavior. At best they can allow  
for the agility that brings truly disruptive 
innovation; at worst they reduce vision 
to near term iterative cycles of  
evolution that fail to take opportunity 
from changing environments.

Fear to take risks. As a CEO you need 
courage to take a business model

is now internationally recognized as an

In my experience with a large archive, 
the biggest hurdle was to make them

1. Organizational antibodies that attack 
a project as resources drawn from 
their area conflict with their business 
objectives. 2. Project management 
processes that can’t deal with risks/
uncertainties associated with bold 
ideas so leaders decline or claw ideas 
back to existing comfort zones.

The biggest obstacle is a belief that

a lot but settle for simplicity once they

 In my experience, 

the biggest obstacle 
is failure to change 
the thinking process 
from the traditional 
linear way to holistic 
and systemic.
Entrepreneurs need to make a concerted 
effort to develop the capability to envi-

The lack of candor and fear of deviating 
from the status quo sets in groupthink. 
Executives are comfortable with exploit

unknown and hence risky.
Cheenu Srinivasan, Australia

In my experience as an Internet 
entrepreneur and investor, the biggest 
obstacles are lack of vision and bad 
governance. Without good vision and 
governance a company will miss the 
emerging industry paradigm and avoid 
reinventing the business model in time.
Nicolas De Santis, U.K.

Within large multinationals it is key to

On an organizational level, the biggest

can be an obstacle. Risk management 
and due diligence color the perceived

design constraints (e.g. regulatory trends, dominant competitors, etc.). This

more informed decisions. With a breakthrough business model, you may 

even become a shaper and transformer of this environment, and set new 

standards for your industry. 

To get a better grasp on your business model “design space,” we suggest 

roughly mapping four main areas of your environment. These are (1) market 

forces, (2) industry forces, (3) key trends, and (4) macroeconomic forces. 

If you’d like to deepen your analysis of the landscape beyond the simple 

mapping we propose, each of these four areas is backed by a large body of 

literature and specifi c analytical tools.

how should your 
business model evolve 
in light of a changing 
environment?

210

A competitive business model that makes sense in today’s environment 

might be outdated or even obsolete tomorrow. We all have to improve 

our understanding of a model’s environment and how it might evolve. 

Of course we can’t be certain about the future, because of the complexities, 

uncertainties, and potential disruptions inherent in the evolving business 

environment. We can, however, develop a number of hypotheses about the 

future to serve as guidelines for designing tomorrow’s business models. 

Assumptions about how market forces, industry forces, key trends, and 

macroeconomic forces unfold give us the “design space” to develop potential 

business model options or prototypes (see p. 160) for the future. The role 

of business model scenarios (see p. 186) in forecasting should also be evi-

dent by now. Painting pictures of the future makes it much easier to generate 

potential business models. Depending on your own criteria (e.g. acceptable 

level of risk, growth potential sought, etc.) you may then select one option 

over another.

evaluating business models

212

Like seeing the doctor for an annual exam, regularly assessing

a business model is an important management activity that allows an 

organization to evaluate the health of its market position and adapt accord-

ingly. This checkup may become the basis for incremental business model 

improvements, or it might trigger a serious intervention in the form of a 

business model innovation initiative. As the automobile, newspaper, and 

music industries have shown, failing to conduct regular checkups may 

prevent early detection of business model problems, and may even lead 

to a company’s demise.

In the previous chapter on the business models environment (see p. 200), 

we evaluated the infl uence of external forces. In this chapter, we adopt the 

point of view of an existing business model and analyze external forces from 

the inside out. 

The following pages outline two types of assessment. First, we provide a 

big picture assessment of Amazon.com’s online retailing model circa 2005 

and describe how the company has built strategically on that model since. 

Second, we provide a set of checklists for assessing your business model’s 

strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) and to help 

you evaluate each Building Block. Keep in mind that assessing a business 

model from a big picture perspective and assessing it from a Building Block 

perspective are complementary activities. A weakness in one Building 

Block, for example, may have consequences for one or several other 

Building Blocks—or for the entire model. Business model assessment, 

therefore, alternates between individual elements and overall integrity.

elements of a business model, while the Business Model Canvas provides 

the focus necessary for a structured discussion.

216

SWOT analysis is familiar to many businesspeople. It is used to analyze 

What are your business model’s . . . 

an organization’s strengths and weaknesses and identify potential opportuni-

ties and threats. It is an attractive tool because of its simplicity, yet its use 

can lead to vague discussions because its very openness offers little direc-

tion concerning which aspects of an organization to analyze. A lack of useful 

outcomes may result, which has lead to a certain SWOT-fatigue among 

managers. When combined with the Business Model Canvas, though, SWOT 

enables a focused assessment and evaluation of an organization’s business 

model and its Building Blocks.

SWOT asks four big, simple questions. The fi rst two—what are your 

organization’s strength and weaknesses?—assess your organization inter-

nally. The second two—what opportunities does your organization have 

and what potential threats does it face?—assess your organization’s posi-

— helpful —

— harmful —

(strengths and opportunities) and two address harmful areas. It is useful to 

ask these four questions with respect to both the overall business model and 

each of its nine Building Blocks. This type of SWOT analysis provides a good 

basis for further discussions, decision-making, and ultimately innovation 

around business models.

using swot assessment analysis results to 
design new business model options

A structured SWOT assessment of your business model yields two results. 

It provides a snapshot of where you are now (strengths and weaknesses) 

and it suggests some future trajectories (opportunities and threats). This is 

valuable input that can help you design new business model options toward 

which your enterprise can evolve. SWOT analysis is thus a signifi cant part 

of the process of designing both business model prototypes (see p. 160) and, 

with luck, a new business model that you will eventually implement.

revisit them from the perspective of the established organization, as  

business model innovation in enterprises already executing on one  

or more existing business models requires taking additional factors 

into account.

assumes that it is difficult to design an outstanding alternative,

5 Phases

The business model design process we propose has five phases: 

Mobilize, Understand, Design, Implement, and Manage. As previ-

ously mentioned, the progression through these phases is rarely 

as linear as depicted in the table on the right. In particular, the 

Understanding and Design phases tend to proceed in parallel. Busi-

ness model prototyping can start early in the Understanding phase, 

in the form of sketching preliminary business model ideas. Similarly, 

prototyping during the design phase may lead to new ideas requiring 

additional research—and a revisiting of the Understand phase. 

Finally, the last phase, Manage, is about continuously managing your 

business model(s). In today’s climate, it’s best to assume that most 

248

business models, even successful ones, will have a short lifespan. 

Considering the substantial investment an enterprise makes in 

producing a business model, it makes sense to extend its life through 

continuous management and evolution until it needs complete 

rethinking. Management of the model’s evolution will determine 

which components are still relevant and which are obsolete.

For each process phase we outline the objective, the focus, and 

which content in Business Model Generation supports that phase. 

Then we outline the five phases in more detail, and explain how the 

circumstances and focus can change when you are working with an 

existing business model in an established organization.

innovative business models, but we’d also like to offer some sug-

gestions on implementing new business models, particularly within 

established organizations. 

Once you’ve arrived at a final business model design, you will start 

translating this into an implementation design. This includes defining all 

related projects, specifying milestones, organizing any legal structures, 

preparing a detailed budget and project roadmap, and so forth. The 

implementation phase is often outlined in a business plan and itemized 

in a project management document.

Particular attention needs to be paid to managing uncertainties. This 

implies closely monitoring how risk/reward expectations play out 

against actual results. It also means developing mechanisms to quickly 

adapt your business model to market feedback.

We hope we’ve shown you how visionaries, game changers, and  
challengers can tackle the vital issue of business models. We hope  
we’ve provided you with the language, the tools and techniques, and  
the dynamic approach needed to design innovative and competitive  
new models. But much remains to be said. So here we touch on five  
topics, each of which might well merit its own book. 

The first examines business models beyond profit: how the Canvas can 
drive business model innovation in the public and non-profit sectors.  
The second suggests how computer-aided business model design might 
leverage the paper-based approach and allow for complex manipulation 
of business model elements. The third discusses the relationship between 
business models and business plans. The fourth addresses issues that 
arise when implementing business models in either new or existing  
organizations. The final topic examines how to better achieve business 
model and IT alignment.

Third-Party Funded Models

In this type of enterprise model, the product or service recipient is 

not the payer. Products and services are paid for by a third party, 

which might be a donor or the public sector. The third party pays the 

organization to fulfill a mission, which may be of a social, ecological, 

or public service nature. For example, government (and indirectly, 

taxpayers) pays schools to deliver education services. Likewise,

Triple Bottom Line Business Models

Earlier we shared the story of how Iqbal Quadir, an investment 

banker in New York, set out to build Grameenphone. His goal was to 

provide universal access to telecommunications services in remote, 

rural areas of his home country of Bangladesh. He achieved his aim 

with a for-profit model that had a profound, positive impact on rural 

Bangladesh. Grameenphone eventually provided over 200,000 

women in rural areas with income-earning opportunities, raised their

reached 100 million people, turned a profit, and became the Bangla-

deshi government’s biggest taxpayer. 

To accommodate triple bottom line business models, we can 

extend the Canvas with Blocks illustrating two outcomes: (1) the 

social and environmental costs of a business model (i.e. its negative 

impact), and (2) the social and environmental benefits of a business 

model (i.e. its positive impact). Just as earnings are increased by 

minimizing financial costs and maximizing income, the triple bottom 

line model seeks to minimize negative social and environmental 

impacts and maximize the positive.

Structure

The characteristics of a business model determine the optimal  

organizational structure for its execution. Does your business model  

call for a highly centralized or decentralized organizational structure?  

If you will implement the model in an established business, should 

the new operation be integrated or spun off (see p. 233)?

business and IT alignment. 

272

recommends that CIOs use the Business Model Canvas to align IT 

and key business processes. This helps them align business and IT 

decisions without diving too deeply into tactical issues.

  We find it useful to pair the Canvas with an Enterprise Archi-

tecture approach. Many of the various Enterprise Architecture 

concepts describe the enterprise from three perspectives: the busi-

ness perspective, the applications perspective, and the technology 

perspective. We recommend using the Canvas to guide the business 

perspective, then align the business with the applications and tech-

nology perspectives. 

In the application perspective, you describe the portfolio of 

applications that leverage aspects of your business model (e.g. 

recommendation systems, supply chain management applications, 

etc.) and you describe all the business model’s information require-

ments (e.g. customer profiles, warehousing, etc.). In the technology 

perspective you describe the technology infrastructure that drives 

your business model (e.g. server farms, data storage systems, etc.).

 process 

The core team, consisting of Alexander, Yves, and Patrick start the project 

with a number of meetings to sketch out the business model of the book. 

The Hub is launched to co-create the book with business model innovation 

practitioners throughout the world. Creative Director Alan Smith of The 

Movement hears about the project and puts his company behind it. Finally, 

Hub member Tim Clark joins the core team after recognizing the need for an 

editor. The group is completed by JAM, a company that uses visual thinking 

to solve business problems. An engagement cycle is started to pump fresh 

“chunks” of content out to the Hub community for feedback and contribu-

tions. The writing of the book becomes completely transparent. Content, 

design, illustrations, and structure are constantly shared and thoroughly com-

mented upon by Hub members worldwide. The core team responds to every 

comment and integrates the feedback back into the book and design. A “soft 

launch” of the book is organized in Amsterdam, Netherlands, so members of 

the Hub can meet in person and share their experiences with business model 

innovation. Sketching out participant business models with JAM becomes the 

core exercise of the day. Two hundred special limited edition prototypes of the 

(unfinished) book go to print and a video of the writing process is produced 

by Fisheye Media. After several more iterations the first print run is produced.

market response

The market response to Business Model Generation has been 

extremely gratifying. The first print run of 5,000 books sold 

out in two months, with no marketing budget and without the 

support of a traditional publisher. News about the book spread 

exclusively by word-of-mouth, blogs, Web sites, e-mail, and 

Twitter. Most gratifying of all, local meetups, where readers and 

Hub followers got together to discuss Business Model Genera-

tion's content, formed spontaneously worldwide.
