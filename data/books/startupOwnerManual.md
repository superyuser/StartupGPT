About this Book

Welcome to The Startup Owner’s Manual e-book.

Here you’ll find all the tips, techniques and best practices that entrepreneurs
need  in  their  quest  to  build  successful  companies  —  packaged  to  suit  your
startup  team’s  particular  path.  This  e-book  organizes  The  Startup  Owner’s
Manual into three e-books to better help you navigate the text. In short:

Book 1: The Strategy Guide provides background on, and an overview
of the Business Model and Customer Development processes

Book 2: The Web/Mobile e-book provides all the step-by-step process
detail you’ll need to create a solid, sustainable startup doing business in
the web/mobile channel, and

Book  3:  The  Physical  Channel  e-book  offers  the  same  for  startups
using physical channels

For best results, start your reading with the Strategy Guide.

The Startup Owner’s Manual Strategy Guide  makes  up  the  first  third  of
the e-book. It provides an overview of why startups are not smaller versions
of large companies; explains how startups search for a business model using
Customer  Development;  and  details  the  overall  customer  development
methodology, and key implementation steps.

For  companies  with  virtual  distribution  channels,  The  Startup  Owner’s
Manual for Web/Mobile Channel Startups, the second part of the e-book,
provides  a  similar  detailed,  step-by-step  process  and  approach  for  startups
that  sell  via  the  web  or  app  stores  channels,  where  things  move  faster,
customers are abundant, and customer attention is always hard to get.

If you’re building a startup with physical distribution channels, you’ll want to
turn  to  the  third  part  of  this  e-book,  The  Startup  Owner’s  Manual  for

Physical  Channel  Startups.  This  section  provides  detailed  guidance,
instructions,  and  examples  on  how  to  build  a  great  company,  step-by-step.
Included  are  details  on  how  to  get,  keep  and  grow  your  customer  base;
checklists  for  tracking  progress;  and  tools  to  help  determine  just  how
successful—or not—you can be.

We believe the Startup Owner’s Manual can help you increase your odds of
finding customers, a market, and product/market fit. Now, as we say, “get of
the building!” And best of luck with your startup.

Preface

IN 1602,  THE DUTCH EAST INDIA COMPANY,  generally  regarded  as  the  first
“modern company,” issued the first stock certificates. In the intervening 300
years, companies managed to start, build and grow without formally trained
executives.  By  the  20th  century,  the  complexity  of  modern  corporations
demanded  a  cadre  of  executives  trained  to  administer  large  companies.  In
1908,  Harvard  awarded  the  first  master  of  business  administration  (MBA)
degree  to  fill  the  need  to  bring  professional  education  standards  to  big
business.  The  MBA  curriculum  standardized  and  codified  the  essential
elements an operating executive in a modern company needed to know: cost
accounting,  strategy,  finance,  product  management,  engineering,  personnel
management and operations.

Formal management tools are about 100 years old.

Fast-forward to the mid-20th century. The pairing of venture capital and
startup entrepreneurship emerged in its modern form, and the startup industry
they fostered has been exploding ever since. Yet for the past 50 years, finding
the successful formula for repeatable startup success has remained a black art.
Founders  have  continually  struggled  with  and  adapted  the  “big  business”
tools,  rules  and  processes  taught  in  business  schools  and  suggested  by  their
investors.  Investors  have  been  shocked  when  startups  failed  to  execute  “the
plan,”  never  admitting  to  the  entrepreneurs  that  no  startup  executes  to  its
business plan. Today, after half a century of practice, we know unequivocally
that the traditional MBA curriculum for running large companies like IBM,
GM and Boeing does not work in startups. In fact, it’s toxic.

With  the  benefit  of  hindsight,  entrepreneurs  now  understand  the
problem,  namely  that  startups  are  not  simply  smaller  versions  of  large
companies.  Companies  execute  business  models  where  customers,  their
problems, and necessary product features are all “knowns.” In sharp contrast,
startups  operate  in  “search”  mode,  seeking  a  repeatable  and  profitable

 
business  model.  The  search  for  a  business  model  requires  dramatically
different rules, roadmaps, skill sets, and tools in order to minimize risk and
optimize chances for success.

By  the  beginning  of  the  21st  century,  entrepreneurs,  led  by  web  and
mobile  startups,  began  to  seek  and  develop  their  own  management  tools.
Now,  a  decade  later,  a  radically  different  set  of  startup  tools  has  emerged,
distinct  from  those  used  in  large  companies  but  as  comprehensive  as  the
traditional  “MBA  Handbook.”  The  result  is  the  emerging  “science  of
entrepreneurial  management.”  My  first  book,  The  Four  Steps  to  the
Epiphany, was one of its first texts. It recognized that the classic books about
large-company  management  were  ill-suited  for  early-stage  ventures.  It
offered  a  reexamination  of  the  existing  product-introduction  process  and
delineated a radically different method that brings customers and their needs
headfirst into the process long before the launch.

We are building the first management tools
specifically for startups.

At  the  time  I  wrote  it,  the  book  was  my  proposed  methodology  for
getting startups right. But just as it was published, agile engineering became
the  preferred  product-development  method.  This  iterative  and  incremental
method created a need and a demand for a parallel process to provide rapid
and  continual  customer  feedback.  The  Customer  Development  process  I
articulated in The Four Steps fit that need perfectly.

Over  the  past  decade,  thousands  of  scientists,  engineers  and  MBAs  in
my  classes  at  Stanford’s  engineering  school  and  U.C.  Berkeley’s  Haas
School  of  Business—plus  those  sponsored  by  the  National  Science
Foundation—have discussed, deployed, assessed and enhanced the Customer
Development process. It has since been implemented by tens of thousands of
entrepreneurs, engineers, and investors worldwide.

While  the  fundamental,  powerful  “Four  Steps”  remain  at  its  core,  this
book is far more than a second edition. Nearly every step in the process, and
in  fact  the  entire  approach,  have  been  enhanced  and  refined  based  on  a
decade of Customer Development experience.

Customer development is paired with agile product

 
development.

Even more gratifying: now, a decade later, multiple books and authors,
are filling shelves in the newly created section for the strategy and science of
entrepreneurship.  Some  of  the  other  areas  in  this  emerging  field  of
entrepreneurial management are:

agile  development,  an 
to
incremental  and 
engineering  that  enables  product  or  service  development  to  iterate  and
pivot to customer and market feedback

interactive  approach 

business model design, which replaces static business plans with a nine-
box map of the key elements that make up a company

creativity and innovation tools for creating and fostering winning ideas

the Lean Startup, an intersection of customer and agile development

lean  user  interface  design  to  improve  web/mobile  interfaces  and
conversion rates

venture  and  entrepreneurial  finance,  to  attract  and  manage  funds  that
fuel the innovation

No  one  book,  including  this  one,  offers  a  complete  roadmap  or  all  the
answers  for  entrepreneurs.  Yet  together,  the  texts  in  the  entrepreneurial
management science library offer entrepreneurs guidance where none existed
before. Startups, driven by potential markets measured in billions of people,
will use this body of knowledge to test, refine and scale their ideas far faster
and more affordably than ever.

No one book, including this one, offers a complete
roadmap...

My co-author Bob and I hope books like this one help speed the startup

revolution and enhance its success—and yours.

Who Is This Book For?

THIS  BOOK  IS  FOR  ALL  ENTREPRENEURS  and  uses  the  term  startup  literally
hundreds of times. But what exactly is a startup? A startup is  not a smaller
version of a large company. A startup is a temporary organization in search
of a scalable, repeatable, profitable business model. At the outset, the startup
business  model  is  a  canvas  covered  with  ideas  and  guesses,  but  it  has  no
customers and minimal customer knowledge.

But we’ve only defined the words startup, entrepreneur, and innovation
halfway.  These  words  mean  different  things  in  Silicon  Valley,  on  Main
Street, and in Corporate America. While each type of startup is distinct, this
book offers guidance for each one.

A startup is a temporary organization in search of a
scalable, repeatable, profitable business model.

Small  Business  Entrepreneurship:  In  the  United  States,  the  majority  of
entrepreneurs and startups are found among 5.9 million small businesses that
make  up  99.7  percent  of  all  U.S.  companies  and  employ  50  percent  of  all
nongovernment  workers.  These  are  often  service-oriented  businesses  like
drycleaners, gas stations and convenience stores, where entrepreneurs define
success  as  paying  the  owners  well  and  making  a  profit,  and  they  seldom
aspire to take over an industry or build a $100 million business.
Scalable  startups  are  the  work  of  traditional  technology  entrepreneurs.
These  entrepreneurs  start  a  company  believing  their  vision  will  change  the
world  and  result  in  a  company  with  hundreds  of  millions  if  not  billions  of
dollars in sales. The early days of a scalable startup are about the search for a
repeatable  and  scalable  business  model.  Scale  requires  external  venture-
capital  investment  in  the  tens  of  millions  to  fuel  rapid  expansion.  Scalable
startups  tend  to  cluster  in  technology  centers  such  as  Silicon  Valley,
Shanghai, New York, Bangalore, and Israel and make up a small percentage
of entrepreneurs, but their outsize return potential attracts almost all the risk

 
capital (and press).

Scalable Startup (Figure i.1)

“Buyable” startups are a new phenomenon. With the extremely low cost of
developing  web/mobile  apps,  startups  can  literally  fund  themselves  on
founders’  credit  cards  and  raise  small  amounts  of  risk  capital,  usually  less
than $1 million. These startups (and their investors) are happy to be acquired
for $5 million to $50 million, purchased by larger companies often to acquire
the talent as much as the business itself.

Large  Company  Entrepreneurship:  Large  companies  have  finite  life
cycles.  Most  grow  by  offering  new  products  that  are  variants  of  their  core
products (an approach known as sustaining innovation). They may also turn
to  disruptive  innovation,  attempting  to  introduce  new  products  into  new
markets  with  new  customers.  Ironically,  large  companies’  size  and  culture
make disruptive innovation (really an effort to launch a scalable startup inside
a big company) extremely difficult to execute.

...large companies’ size and culture make disruptive
innovation extremely difficult.

leverage, 

Social  entrepreneurs  build  innovative  nonprofits  to  change  the  world.
Customer  Development  provides  them  a  scorecard  for  assessing  scalability,
investment  and  growth  metrics.  These
asset 
entrepreneurial  ventures  seek  solutions  rather  than  profits  and  happen  on
every  continent  in  areas  as  diverse  as  water,  agriculture,  health,  and
microfinance.

return  on 

While  the  Customer  Development  process  helps  scalable  startups  the
most, each of these five startup types has entrepreneurship and innovation at
its heart. And each improves its chances for finding the right path to success
through the use of Customer Development.

Who Is This Book Not For?

There  are  cases  where  using  the  Customer  Development  methodology  and
this book is inappropriate.

Early-stage ventures fall into two types: those with customer/market risk

and those with invention risk.

Markets  with  invention  risk  are  those  where  it’s  questionable  whether
the technology can ever be made to work, but if it does, customers will
beat  a  path  to  the  company’s  door.  (Think  life  sciences  and  cure  for
cancer.)

Markets  with  customer/market  risk  are  those  where  the  unknown  is
whether customers will adopt the product.

For companies building web-based products, product development may
be difficult, but with enough time and iteration, Engineering will eventually
converge  on  a  solution  and  ship  a  functional  product—it’s engineering, not
invention. The real risk is in whether there is a customer and a market for the
product as spec’ed. In these markets it’s all about customer/market risk.

There’s  a  whole  other  set  of  markets  where  the  risk  is  truly  invention.
These are markets where it may take five or even 10 years to get a product
out of the lab and into production (e.g., biotech). Whether it will eventually
work, no one knows, but the payoff can be so large that investors will take
the risk. In these markets it’s all about invention risk.

 
Startups solve customer and market risk by reading
this book.

A third type of market has both invention and market risk. For example,
complex  new  semiconductor  architectures  mean  you  may  not  know  if  the
chip  performs  as  well  as  you  thought  until  you  get  first  silicon.  But  then,
because there might be entrenched competitors and your concept is radically
new, you still need to invest in the Customer Development process to learn
how to get design wins from companies that may be happy with their existing
vendors.

Startups  solve  invention  risk  by  using  simulation  tools  (computational
fluid  dynamics,  finite  element  analysis,  etc.).  Startups  solve  customer  and
market  risk  by  reading  this  book.  When  the  issues  are  customer  acceptance
and market adoption, this book shows the path.

 
Introduction

A legendary hero is usually the founder of something—the founder of a
new age, the founder of a new religion, the founder of a new city, the
founder of a new way of life. In order to found something new, one has
to leave the old and go on a quest of the seed idea, a germinal idea that
will have the potential of bringing forth that new thing.

— Joseph Campbell, The Hero with a Thousand Faces

JOSEPH  CAMPBELL  POPULARIZED  THE  NOTION  of  an  archetypal  “hero’s
journey,”  a  pattern  that  recurs  in  the  mythologies  and  religions  of  cultures
around  the  world.  From  Moses  and  the  burning  bush  to  Luke  Skywalker’s
meeting Obi-wan Kenobi, the journey always begins with a hero who hears a
calling to a quest. At the outset of the voyage, the path is unclear and no end
is  in  sight.  Each  hero  meets  a  unique  set  of  obstacles,  but  Campbell’s  keen
insight was that the outline of these stories is always the same. There are not
a thousand different heroes but one hero with a thousand faces.

The hero’s journey is an apt way to think of startups. All new companies
and new products begin with a vision—a hope for what could be and a goal
few  others  can  see.  It’s  this  bright  and  burning  founder’s  vision  that
differentiates  an  entrepreneur  from  a  big-company  CEO  and  separates
startups from existing businesses.

Founding  entrepreneurs  are  out  to  make  their  vision  and  business  real.
To succeed, they must abandon the status quo, recruit a team that shares their
vision,  and  strike  out  together  on  what  appears  to  be  a  new  path,  often
shrouded  in  uncertainty,  fear  and  doubt.  Obstacles,  hardships  and  potential
disaster  lie  ahead,  and  their  journey  to  success  tests  more  than  financial
resources—it tests their stamina, agility, and courage.

Take a new path, often shrouded in uncertainty,
fear, and doubt.

Every entrepreneur is certain his or her journey is unique. Each travels
down  the  startup  path  without  a  roadmap  and  believes  that  no  model  or
template  could  possibly  apply.  What  makes  some  startups  successful  while
others sell off the furniture often seems like luck. But it isn’t. As Campbell
suggests, the outline is always the same. The path to startup success is well-
traveled and well-understood. There is a true and repeatable path to success.
This book charts that path.

A Repeatable Path

In the last quarter of the 20th century, startups thought they knew the correct
path  for  the  startup  journey.  They  adopted  a  methodology  for  product
development,  launch,  and  life-cycle  management  almost  identical  to  the
processes  taught  in  business  schools  for  use  in  large  companies.  These
processes  provide  detailed  business  plans,  checkpoints  and  goals  for  every
step toward getting a product out the door—sizing markets, estimating sales,
developing marketing-requirements documents, prioritizing product features.
Yet at the end of the day, even with all these processes, the embarrassing fact
is that in companies large and small, established corporate giants as well as
new  startups,  more  than  nine  of  10  new  products  fail.  It’s  true  in  every
product  category—high-tech  or  low,  online  or  off,  consumer  or  business—
well-funded or not.

Even  after  decades  of  similar  failures,  investors  are  always  surprised
when  a  new  venture  fails  to  execute  its  business  “plan.”  And  still  they
continue to rely on the same product-introduction processes.

We  now  know  what  the  problem  is.  Startups  have  been  using  tools
appropriate  for  executing  a  known  business.  But  startups  are  all  about
unknowns. To find the path to build a winning startup, entrepreneurs must try
a new way:

Winners throw out the traditional product management and introduction
processes  they  learned  at  existing  companies.  Instead,  they  combine  agile
engineering  and  Customer  Development  to  iteratively  build,  test  and  search
for a business model, turning unknowns into knowns.

Winners  also  recognize  their  startup  “vision”  as  a  series  of  untested
hypotheses  in  need  of  “customer  proof.”  They  relentlessly  test  for  insights,
and  they  course-correct  in  days  or  weeks,  not  months  or  years,  to  preserve

 
cash  and  eliminate  time  wasted  on  building  features  and  products  that
customers don’t want.

Winners recognize their startup is a series of
untested hypotheses.

Losers  blindly  execute  a  rigid  product  management  and  introduction
methodology.  They  assume  that  the  founder’s  vision  drives  the  business
strategy and product development plans and that all they need to do is to raise
funds for execution.

Founders,  not  employees,  must  search  for  a  business  model.  The  best
way to search is for the founders themselves to get out of the building to gain
a deep, personal, firsthand understanding of their potential customers’ needs
before  locking  into  a  specific  path  and  precise  product  specs.  That’s  the
difference between winners and losers. It’s also the Customer Development
process detailed in this book.

Why a Second Decade?

Startups have now been using Customer Development for a decade, since the
initial  publication  of  The  Four  Steps  to  the  Epiphany.  If  this  is  your  first
contact  with  the  Four  Steps,  welcome  aboard.  For  the  tens  of  thousands
who’ve  embraced  that  first  version,  The  Startup  Owner’s  Manual  offers  a
great deal more. The first version assumed startups were high-tech ventures
in  Silicon  Valley  selling  products  through  a  physical  sales  channel  and
aiming  to  be  billion-dollar  businesses.  A  lot  has  happened  in  10  years,  and
this version embraces those changes. For example:

Bits: The Second Industrial Revolution

For  thousands  of  years  after  the  invention  of  the  wheel,  a  product  was  a
physical  object  one  could  touch,  such  as  food,  cars,  planes,  books,  and
household goods. These physical products reached customers via a physical
sales  channel:  salespeople  visiting  customers,  or  customers  visiting  stores.
Figure  i.2  shows  this  intersection  of  physical  products  sold  through  a

 
physical channel.

Physical Products Sold Through a Physical Channel (Figure i.2)

One  of  the  breakthroughs  in  commerce  was  the  invention  of  products
that were ideas or promises that didn’t exist in physical form, such as life and
health insurance, stocks and bonds, and commodity futures.

In the 1970s, software began to be sold as a product unbundled from any
particular  computer.  The  ability  to  purchase  bits  was  a  new  concept.  By
themselves the bits were useless, but when combined with a computer in the
form of software applications, bits solved problems or amused people (word
processing,  balancing  checkbooks,  game  play).  These  software  applications
and  entertainment,  all  in  the  form  of  bits,  were  sold  to  consumers  through
specialized retail computer stores, a physical channel.

Software Products Sold Through Physical Channels (Figure i.3)

Still  other  software  applications  were  designed  to  solve  problems
sales

(database  access,  manufacturing  automation, 

companies  had 

automation), and added the upper right box to Figure i.3, Software Products
Sold Through Physical Channels.

As  the  Internet  created  a  new  form  of  sales  channel,  a  new  class  of
company  emerged  with  the  value  proposition  to  sell  physical  products  over
the  Internet.  Amazon,  Zappos,  Dell,  and  a  whole  raft  of  other  e-commerce
companies filled a new niche: physical products sold via a web channel. This
new  sales  channel  created  massive  disruption  in  the  existing  world  of
physical distribution, as book and music retailers perhaps know best of all.

Physical Products in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure i.4)

Over the past decade a new class of product has emerged, where BOTH
the  product  and  the  channel  are  bits  (see  Figure i.5).  Startups  can  now  be

built  for  thousands  rather  than  millions  of  dollars  and  in  weeks  rather  than
years.  As  a  result,  the  number  of  startups  founded  each  year  has  exploded.
New applications such as social networks that duplicate the socialization we
once  had  face-to-face  are  being  mediated  via  machine.  Search  engines  that
scour the web, such as Google and Bing, exist only in bits, in a web/mobile
channel.

More  important,  entire  industries  that  started  by  selling  physical
products in physical locations have begun their migration to bits sold over the
Internet.  Originally,  people  sold  books,  music,  videos,  movies,  travel,  and
stocks  and  bonds  either  face-to-face  or  in  storefronts.  Those  channels  are
either  radically  transformed  or  disappearing  as  physical  products  turn  into
bits.

Software Products In Web/Mobile Channels (Figure i.5)

Speed, Time and Iterations: the “Second Industrial

Revolution”

Regardless  of  the  business,  any  enterprise  focused  on  the  bottom  righthand
box  in  Figure  i.2—Physical  Goods  Sold  through  a  Physical  Channel—has
discovered  over  the  past  decade  that  the  old  rules  and  tools  for  physical
businesses  and  channels  no  longer  apply.  They’ve  learned  that  the  closer  a
company gets to a web/mobile channel and a web/mobile product, the faster
it  can  change,  test  and  optimize  both  product  and  offer.  They  need  a  new
process  to  quickly  adapt  to  the  new  freedoms  a  web/mobile  channel  and
product allow, and they’ve found it in Customer Development.

The  Customer  Development  process  gathers  customer  feedback  about
product,  channel,  price,  and  positioning,  all  of  which  can  be  modified  and
tested  in  near-real  time,  and  uses  it  as  immediate  feedback  to  iterate  and
optimize.  As  a  result,  web/mobile  channel  startups  can  move  forward  at
“Internet  speed,”  an  impossibility  with  physical  distribution  channels  and
products.

A  mere  decade  ago,  getting  feedback  on  the  features  of  a  video  game
required  recruiting  focus  groups  to  come  in  and  play  the  game  while  being
observed  through  one-way  mirrors.  Today,  companies  like  Zynga  test  and
tune  the  features  of  their  online  games  in  days.  Are  sales  slow  because  the
game  is  too  hard?  You  can  adjust  the  scoring  or  other  game  variables  and
change the product itself quicker than you can say touchdown.

Customer Development is the process to organize
the search for the business model.

Theoretically,  when  startups’  products  and  channels  are  bits,  they  can
gather  and  act  on  information  100  times  faster  than  companies  delivering
physical goods via physical sales channels (10 times the number of iterative
learning cycles, each using only 10 percent of the cash.) In fact, companies
like  Facebook,  Google,  Groupon,  and  Zynga  grew  faster  in  a  decade  than
most industrial corporations grew in the 20th century. That’s why we call it
the Second Industrial Revolution.

 
The Four Steps: A New Path

The core of Customer Development is blissfully simple: Products developed
by founders who get out in front of customers early and often, win. Products
handed  off  to  sales  and  marketing  organizations  that  are  only  tangentially
involved  in  the  new-product  development  process  will  lose.  There  are  no
facts inside your building, so get the heck outside. Getting out of the building
means acquiring a deep understanding of customer needs and combining that
knowledge with incremental and iterative product development. The mix of
Customer  Development  and  Agile  engineering  dramatically  increases  the
odds  of  new  product  and  company  success,  while  reducing  the  need  for
upfront cash and eliminating wasted time, energy, money and effort.

There are no facts inside your building, so get the
heck outside.

Customer Development recognizes the startup’s mission as a relentless
search to refine its vision and idea, and to make changes in every aspect of
the business invalidated during the search process. An entrepreneur seeks to
test  a  series  of  unproven  hypotheses  (guesses)  about  a  startup’s  business
model: who the customers are, what the product features should be, and how
this  scales  into  a  hugely  successful  company.  Customer  Development
recognizes  a  startup  is  a  temporary  organization  built  to  search  for  the
answers to what makes a repeatable and scalable business model. Customer
Development is the process to organize that search.

The Path to Disaster: A Startup Is Not a
Small Version of a Big Company

The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and
expecting different results.

—Albert Einstein

WHILE THIS STORY IS OLD, ITS LESSONS are timeless. In the heyday of the dot-
com  bubble  at  the  end  of  the  20th century, Webvan  stood  out  as  one  of  the
most  electrifying  new  startups,  with  an  idea  that  would  potentially  touch
every household in America. Raising one of the largest financial war chests
ever seen (more than $800 million), the company aimed to revolutionize the
$450 billion retail grocery business with online ordering and same-day door-
to-door  grocery  delivery.  Webvan  believed  this  was  one  of  the  first  “killer
applications”  for  the  Internet.  Customers  could  just  point,  click,  and  order.
Webvan’s CEO told Forbes magazine that Webvan would “set the rules for
the largest consumer sector in the economy.”

Beyond  amassing  megabucks,  the  Webvan  entrepreneurs  seemed  to  do
everything  right.  Backed  by  experienced  venture-capital  investors,  the
company  raced  to  build  vast  automated  warehouses  and  bought  fleets  of
delivery  trucks  while  building  an  easy-to-use  website.  Webvan  hired  a
seasoned  CEO  from  the  consulting  industry.  What’s  more,  most  initial
customers  actually  liked  the  service.  But  barely  24  months  after  the  initial
public offering, Webvan was bankrupt and out of business. What happened?

...barely 24 months after the initial public offering,
Webvan was bankrupt.

This was not a failure of execution. Webvan did everything its board and
investors asked. In particular, the company fervently followed the traditional
new-product  introduction  model  commonly  used  by  most  new  ventures  and
embraced the mantras of the time: “first mover advantage” and “get big fast.”
Webvan’s  failure  to  ask  “where  are  the  customers?”  illuminates  how  this
tried-and-true model led one of the best-funded startups of all time down the
path to disaster.

The Traditional New-Product Introduction Model

In  the  20th  century,  every  company  bringing  a  new  product  to  market  used
some form of product management model (Figure 1.1). Emerging early in the
century,  this  product-centric  model  described  a  process  that  evolved  in
manufacturing industries. The consumer packaged-goods industry adopted it
in the 1950s, and it spread to the technology business in the last quarter of the
century. There it became an integral part of the startup culture.

At  first  glance,  the  new-product  introduction  model  outlined  in  the
diagram at right appears to be helpful and benign. It illustrates the process of
getting  a  new  product  into  the  hands  of  waiting  customers.  A  new  product
moves  from  development  to  customer  testing  (alpha/beta  test),  and  using
feedback from this initial testing, the product engineers fix technical errors in
the product until the product launch date and first customer ship.

The  new-product  introduction  model  is  a  good  fit  for  an  existing
company where the customers are known, the product features can be spec’ed
upfront,  the  market  is  well-defined,  and  the  basis  of  competition  is
understood.

 
New Product Introduction Diagram (Figure 1.1)

As for startups, a scant few fit these criteria. Few even know who their
customers are. Yet many persist in using the new-product introduction model
not  only  to  manage  product  development  but  as  a  roadmap  for  finding
customers  and  setting  the  timing  for  the  startup’s  sales,  launch  and  revenue
plans.  Investors  use  the  new-product  introduction  diagram  to  set  and  plan
funding. All parties involved in the startup use a roadmap leading toward a
very different location, yet they’re surprised to end up lost.

What’s  wrong  with  the  old  model,  and  how  did  it  contribute  to  the

billion-dollar Webvan implosion?

Concept and Seed Stage

At the concept and seed stage, founders capture their passion and vision for
the company, sometimes on the back of a napkin, and turn them into a set of
key ideas, which becomes the outline for the business plan.

Next, issues surrounding the product are defined. What is the product or
service concept? What are the product features and benefits? Can it be built?
Is further technical research needed? Who will the customers be, and where
will  they  be  found?  Statistical  and  market  research  and  a  few  customer
interviews fuel the evaluation and business plan.

the  customer, 

This  step  also  brings  forth  a  first  guess  at  how  the  product  will
ultimately  reach 
including  discussions  of  competitive
differences,  distribution  channels,  and  costs.  An  initial  positioning  chart
explains  the  company  and  its  benefits  to  venture  capitalists  or  corporate
higher-ups.  The  business  plan  now  gets  market-size,  competitive  and
financial  sections,  with  an  appendix  containing  Excel  spreadsheets
forecasting revenue and expenses. Creative writing, passion and shoe leather
combine in the concept and seed phase in hopes of convincing an investor to
fund the company or the new division.

Once a waterfall process starts, the proverbial train
has left the station...

Webvan did all of this extremely well. Founded in December 1996, with

 
a  compelling  story  and  a  founder  with  a  track  record,  Webvan  raised  $10
million  from  leading  Silicon  Valley  venture  capitalists  in  1997.  In  the  next
two  years,  additional  private  rounds  totaling  an  unbelievable  $393  million
followed before the company’s IPO.

Product Development

In  stage  two,  product  development,  everyone  stops  talking  and  starts
working.  The  respective  departments  go  to  their  figurative  corners  as  the
company  begins  to  specialize  by  function.  Marketing  refines  the  size  of  the
market defined in the business plan and begins to target the first customers.
In a well-organized startup (one with a fondness for process), the marketing
folk might even run a focus group or two on the market they think they’re in
and  work  with  Product  Management  on  a  market  requirements  document
(MRD) for engineering to specify the product’s final features and functions.
Marketing  starts  to  build  a  sales  demo,  writes  sales  materials  (websites,
presentations,  data  sheets),  and  hires  a  pr  agency.  In  this  stage,  or  by  alpha
test, the company traditionally hires a VP of Sales.

Meanwhile,  Engineering  focuses  on  specifying  and  then  building  the
product.  The  simple  box  labeled  “Product  Development”  typically  expands
into  a  “waterfall”  or  “spiral”  or  incremental  process  of  interlacing  steps,  all
focused on minimizing development risk of a defined feature set (Figure 1.2).
This process starts with the founder’s vision, which may be expanded into an
MRD  (and  a  product  requirements  document),  and  expands  further  into
detailed  engineering  specifications.  With  those  in  hand,  Engineering  begins
implementation fueled by cold pizza and long nights and weekends. Once a
waterfall  process  starts,  the  proverbial  train  has  left  the  station  and  the
product is nearly impossible to revise. As a rule, the “train” can run almost
nonstop  for  18  or  perhaps  24  months  or  more,  uninterrupted  by  changes  or
new ideas no matter how good they might be for the business.

The Product Development “Waterfall” Model (Figure 1.2)

In  Webvan’s  case,  Engineering  moved  along  two  fronts:  building  the
automated warehouses and designing the website. The automated warehouses
were  a  technological  marvel,  with  automated  conveyors  and  carousels
transporting  food  items  off  the  shelves  to  workers  who  packed  them  for
delivery.  Webvan  also  designed  its  own  inventory,  warehouse,  and  route
management systems and software to manage the entire customer order and

delivery process. This software communicated with the Webvan website and
issued  order-fulfillment  instructions  to  the  distribution  center.  Once  a
delivery  was  scheduled, 
the  system’s  custom  route-planning  feature
determined  the  most  efficient  route  for  delivering  the  goods  to  customers’
homes.

At  the  same  time,  planning  began  for  a  marketing  and  promotion
program designed to strengthen the Webvan brand name, get customers to try
the  service  in  the  first  target  market,  build  strong  customer  loyalty,  and
maximize repeat usage and purchases. The plan was to build Webvan’s brand
name (down to stickering every cup holder in San Francisco’s AT&T Park)
and  customer 
through  public  relations  programs,  advertising
campaigns  and  promotional  activities.  Spending  for  all  these  activities  was
part of the business plan.

loyalty 

Alpha/Beta Test

In  stage  three,  the  alpha/beta  test,  Engineering  continues  building  along  the
classic waterfall development model, working toward the first customer ship
date. And, by beta test time, working with a small group of outside users to
test the product and ensure that it works as specified. Marketing develops a
complete  marketing  communications  plan,  sets  up  the  corporate  website,
provides  Sales  with  a  full  complement  of  support  materials,  and  starts  the
public  relations  bandwagon  rolling.  The  pr  agency  polishes  the  positioning
and  starts  contacting  the  long-lead-time  press  and  blogs,  while  Marketing
starts the branding activities.

Sales signs up the first beta customers (who may volunteer to pay for the
privilege  of  testing  a  new  product),  begins  to  build  the  selected  distribution
channel,  and  staffs  and  scales  the  sales  organization  outside  headquarters.
The  sales  VP  works  toward  achieving  the  revenue  plan  as  specified  in  the
business plan. Investors and board members start measuring progress by the
number of orders in place by first customer ship. The CEO hits the streets and
the  phone  or  the  parent-company  headquarters,  searching  for  additional
capital.

Webvan began to beta-test its grocery delivery service in May 1999 with
about 1,100 customers. At the same time, the marketing buzz started with a
pr  blitz  with  hundreds  of  articles  touting  the  newest  entrant  in  the  online
grocery  business.  Private  investors  poured  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars

into the company.

Product Launch and First Customer Ship

With  the  product  working  (sort  of),  the  company  goes  into  “big-bang”
spending  mode.  The  product  and  the  company  are  launched.  The  company
has a large press event, and Marketing launches a series of programs to create
end-user demand. In anticipation of sales, the company hires a national sales
organization; the sales channel has quotas and sales goals. The board begins
measuring  company  performance  based  on  sales  execution  against  its
business  plan,  albeit  one  typically  written  at  least  a  year  earlier,  when  the
company first sought investment.

Building  a  sales  channel  and  supporting  marketing  burn  a  lot  of  cash.
Assuming  no  early  liquidity  event  for  the  company,  more  fund-raising  is
often required. The CEO looks at the product-launch activities and the scale-
up  of  the  sales  and  marketing  team  and  goes  out  yet  again,  palm  up,  to  the
investor community. (In the dot-com bubble economy, investors used an IPO
at product launch to take the money and run, before there was a track record
of  success  or  failure.)  This  operational  model  no  doubt  sounds  familiar  to
many: a product- and process-centric model used by countless startups to take
their first products to market.

Webvan launched its first regional web store in June 1999 (just a month
after  starting  beta  test)  and  filed  for  its  public  offering  60  days  later.  The
company raised $400 million and had a market capitalization of $8.5 billion
the day of its IPO—larger than the market cap of the top three grocery chains
combined. The elation was short-lived.

The 9 Deadly Sins of the New Product
Introduction Model

For  new  products  like  Webvan,  the  business  plan  fails  as  a  roadmap
because both the product and the customer are unknown. For most startups,
these nine flawed assumptions are the most toxic of all:

1. Assuming “I Know What the Customer Wants”

First  is  the  founder’s  unwavering  belief  that  he  or  she  understands  who  the
customers  will  be,  what  they  need,  and  how  to  sell  it  to  them.  Any
dispassionate  observer  would  recognize  that  on  Day  One,  a  startup  has  no
customers, and unless the founder is a true domain expert, he or she can only
guess  about  the  customer,  problem,  and  business  model.  On  Day  One,  a
startup is a faith-based initiative built on guesses. Yet the traditional product
introduction  methodology  has  founders  take  these  many  business  model
guesses as facts and go design a product and start spending money to build it
on a race to “first customer ship”—all before talking to a single customer.

On Day One, a startup is a faith-based initiative...

To  succeed,  founders  need  to  turn  hypotheses  or  guesses  into  facts  as
soon  as  possible  by  getting  out  of  the  building,  asking  customers  if  the
hypotheses were correct, and quickly changing those that were wrong.

2. The “I Know What Features to Build” Flaw

The  second  flawed  assumption  is  implicitly  driven  by  the  first.  Founders,
presuming  they  know  their  customers,  assume  they  know  all  the  features
customers  need.  These  founders  specify,  design,  and  build  a  fully  featured
product  using  classic  product  development  methods  without  ever  leaving
their building. But wait—isn’t that what startups should do? No—that’s what
companies with existing customers do.

 
...it’s unknown whether the features appeal to
customers.

The  waterfall  development  process  proceeds  sequentially  and  without
interruption for as long as a year or two. Progress is measured by each new
line  of  code  written  or  new  piece  of  hardware  built  throughout  the  process
until  the  product  is  released.  Yet  without  direct  and  continuous  customer
contact,  it’s  unknown  whether  the  features  appeal  to  customers.  Fixing  the
inevitable product mistakes after building and shipping the entire product is
costly and time-consuming, if not deadly. It can render the product obsolete
by launch. Worse, it often causes huge engineering waste, with hundreds of
hours of work tossed aside, or tons of code cut and dropped to the floor, when
customers  say  the  new  features  aren’t  ones  they  care  about.  Ironically,
startups were often crippled by the very methodology they traditionally used
to build new products.

3. Focus on Launch Date

The  traditional  product  introduction  model  focuses  engineering,  sales  and
marketing  on  the  all-important,  immovable  launch  date.  Marketing  tries  to
pick an “event” (trade show, conference, blog, etc.) where they can “launch”
the product. Executives look at that date and the calendar, working backward
to ignite fireworks on the day the product is launched. Neither management
nor investors tolerate “wrong turns” that result in delays. In fact, traditional
engineering  schedules  have  test  cycles  with  the  names  alpha,  beta,  and
release but rarely allow time to improve the product. They’re still geared to
putting out the original product with minimal bugs, though.

The  product  launch  and  first  customer  ship  dates  are  merely  the  dates
when  a  product  development  team  thinks  the  product’s  first  release  is
“finished.” It doesn’t mean the company understands its customers or how to
market or sell to them, yet in almost every startup, ready or not, departmental
clocks  are  set  irrevocably  to  “first  customer  ship.”  Even  worse,  a  startup’s
investors are managing their financial expectations by this date as well.

The chorus of investor voices says, “Why, of course that’s what you do.
Getting  the  product  to  market  is  what  sales  and  marketing  people  do  in
startups. That’s how a startup makes money.” This is deadly advice. Ignore it.

 
Focusing only on launch results in a “fire, ready, aim” strategy that ignores
the  customer  discovery  process—a  fundamental  and  generally  fatal  error.
Obviously,  every  startup  or  company  wants  to  get  a  product  to  market  and
sell it, but that can’t be done until the company understands who it’s selling
to and why they’ll buy. The forced march ignores the iterative loop that says,
“If our assumptions are wrong, maybe we need to try something different.” It
shuts  off  the  “build,  test  and  learn”  flow  and  assumes  that  customers  will
come based merely on good engineering execution.

Time  after  time,  only  after  launch  does  a  startup  discover  that  not
enough  customers  visit  its  website,  play  the  game,  bring  their  friends,  or
convert  to  orders.  Or  it  discovers  that  early  customers  don’t  scale  into  a
mainstream market, or the product doesn’t solve a high-value problem, or the
cost of distribution is too high. While those discoveries are bad enough, the
startup  is  now  burdened  with  an  expensive,  scaled-up  sales  and  marketing
organization—effective  only  at  burning  mountains  of  cash—that’s  now
trying to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it.

At  Webvan,  the  dot-com  mania  may  have  intensified  the  company’s
drive to launch, but its single-minded focus was typical of most startups. At
first customer ship, Webvan had close to 400 employees. It hired more than
500 more during the next six months. By May 1999, the company had opened
its first $40 million distribution center, built and scaled for a customer base it
could only guess at, and it had committed to 15 other distribution centers of
the  same  size.  Why?  Because  the  Webvan  business  plan  said  to  do  so,
regardless of whether the customers agreed.

4. Emphasis on Execution Instead of Hypotheses,
Testing, Learning, and Iteration

Startup cultures emphasize “get it done, and get it done fast.” So it’s natural
that heads of engineering, sales and marketing all believe they are hired for
what they know how to do, not what they can learn. They assume that their
experience is relevant to this new venture and that all they need do is put that
knowledge to work managing the execution that’s worked for them before.

While established companies execute business models where customers,
problems,  and  necessary  product  features  are  all  knowns,  startups  need  to
operate in a “search” mode as they test and prove every one of their initial

hypotheses. They learn from the results of each test, refine the hypothesis and
test  again,  all  in  search  of  a  repeatable,  scalable  and  profitable  business
model.

Relentless execution without knowing what to
execute is a crime.

In practice, startups begin with a set of initial hypotheses (guesses), most
of  which  will  end  up  being  wrong.  Therefore,  focusing  on  execution  and
delivering a product or service based on those initial, untested hypotheses is a
going-out-of-business strategy.

In  contrast,  the  traditional  product  introduction  model  assumes  that
building  a  startup  is  a  step-by-step,  sequential,  execution-oriented  process.
Each  step  unfolds  in  a  logical  progression  that  can  be  captured  in  a  PERT
chart (a project management technique that maps the steps and time required
for  project  completion),  with  milestones  and  resources  assigned  for  the
completion of each step. But anyone who has ever taken a new product out to
a  set  of  potential  customers  knows  that  a  good  day  in  front  of  customers  is
two steps forward and one step back. The ability to learn from these missteps
distinguishes a successful startup from those that have vanished.

Like  all  startups  focused  on  executing  to  a  sequential  product
introduction plan, Webvan hired vice presidents of merchandising, marketing
and  product  management—all  oriented  around  executing  a  given  sales  and
marketing strategy instead of listening to customers and discovering customer
needs.  Sixty  days  after  first  customer  ship,  those  three  VPs  employed  more
than 50 people.

The ability to learn from missteps distinguishes a
successful startup.

5. Traditional Business Plans Presume No Trial and
No Errors

 
 
The  one  great  advantage  of  the  traditional  product  development  model:  it
provides  boards  and  founders  an  unambiguous  path  with  clearly  defined
milestones the board presumes will be achieved. Most engineers know what
alpha  test,  beta  test,  and  first  customer  ship  mean.  If  the  product  fails  to
work,  everyone  stops  to  fix  it.  In  stark  contrast,  before  first  customer  ship,
sales  and  marketing  activities  are  ad  hoc  and  fuzzy,  and  seldom  have
measurable,  concrete  objectives.  They  lack  any  way  to  stop  and  fix  what’s
broken (and don’t even know if it’s broken or how to stop).

Financial  progress  is  tracked  using  metrics  like  income  statement,
balance  sheet  and  cash  flow  even  when  there’s  no  revenue  to  measure.  In
reality,  none  of  these  are  useful  for  startups.  Board  directors  have  simply
adopted  the  traditional  metrics  used  in  large  companies  with  existing
customers and known business models. In a startup, these metrics don’t track
progress  against  the  startup’s  only  goal:  to  find  a  repeatable  and  scalable
business model. Instead, traditional metrics get in the way.

Instead of asking, “How many days to the beta test?” or, “What’s in our
sales pipeline?” a startup’s board and management team need to ask specific
questions about results of its long list of tests and experiments to validate all
components of its business model.

If a startup’s board of directors isn’t asking these kinds of questions, it’s
wasting  time  without  adding  value.  No  matter  what,  directors  and  founders
must stay focused on one financial metric that always matters: cash burn rate
and number of months’ worth of cash left in the bank.

If a startup’s board of directors isn’t asking these
kinds of questions, it’s wasting time...

Webvan  had  no  milestones  saying,  “Stop  and  evaluate  the  launch
results.”  Otherwise,  it  might  have  noticed  the  stark  contrast  between  the
2,000 daily orders it was getting and the 8,000 in the business-plan forecast.
Before  any  meaningful  customer  feedback  was  in  hand  and  only  a  month
after shipping began, Webvan signed a $1 billion deal (yes, $1,000,000,000)
with  Bechtel  to  build  26  additional  distribution  centers  over  the  next  three
years.

6. Confusing Traditional Job Titles with What a

 
Startup Needs to Accomplish

Most  startups  have  simply  borrowed  job  titles  from  established  companies.
But  remember,  these  are  jobs  in  an  organization  that’s  executing  a  known
business  model.  The  title  Sales  in  an  existing  company  reflects  a  team
repeatedly selling a known product to a well-understood group of customers
with  standard  presentations,  prices,  terms,  and  conditions.  Startups  by
definition  have  few  if  any  of  these  known  elements.  In  fact,  they’re  out
searching for them!

Because target customers, product specs and product presentations may
change daily, early-stage startup executives need dramatically different skills
from  executives  who  are  working  in  an  established  company  selling
established products or line extensions. The demands of customer discovery
require  people  who  are  comfortable  with  change,  chaos,  and  learning  from
failure  and  are  at  ease  working  in  risky,  unstable  situations  without  a
roadmap. In short, startups should welcome the rare breed  generally  known
as  entrepreneurs.  They’re  open  to  learning  and  discovery—highly  curious,
inquisitive, and creative. They must be eager to search for a repeatable and
scalable  business  model.  Agile  enough  to  deal  with  daily  change  and
operating “without a map.” Readily able to wear multiple hats, often on the
same day, and comfortable celebrating failure when it leads to learning and
iteration.

Webvan’s CEO and VPs all came from large-company backgrounds and
experience.  They  were  surprised  and  uncomfortable  with  the  chaos  of  a
startup and tried to solve the problem by scaling the company rapidly.

...measuring progress against a product launch or
revenue plan is simply false progress.

7. Sales and Marketing Execute to a Plan

Hiring VPs and execs with the right titles but the wrong skills leads to further
startup  trouble  as  high-powered  sales  and  marketing  people  arrive  on  the
payroll to execute the “plan.” Here’s how it typically unfolds:

 
Following  the  business  plan  and  the  traditional  product  introduction
model, the board and founders agree to a launch date, a burn rate, a revenue
plan and a set of milestones. The sales VP begins to hire the core sales team,
design  sales  pitches,  and  make  appointments  and  attempts  to  acquire  early
“lighthouse” customers (prominent customers who will attract others). At the
same time, the sales team uses revenue goals specified in the business plan to
track its progress in understanding customers. Meanwhile, the marketing VP
is  busy  designing  websites,  logos,  presentations,  data  sheets  and  collateral,
and  hiring  pr  agencies  to  create  buzz.  These  tactics  become  marketing
objectives, even though they’re merely tactics. Marketing discovers whether
its positioning, messaging, pricing and demand-creation activities will work
only after first customer ship.

Executives  and  board  members  accustomed  to  measurable  signs  of
progress  against  “the  plan”  will  focus  on  these  execution  activities  because
this is what they know how to do (and what they believe they were hired to
do). Of course, in established companies with known customers and markets,
this  focus  makes  sense.  And  even  in  some  startups  in  “existing  markets,”
where customers and markets are known, it might work. But in a majority of
startups,  measuring  progress  against  a  product  launch  or  revenue  plan  is
simply  false  progress,  since  it  transpires  in  a  vacuum  absent  real  customer
feedback,  instead  of  searching  for  an  understanding  of  customers  and  their
problems and replacing assumptions with facts.

Webvan set off on this kind of plan-driven “marketing death march.” In
its first six months, it acquired an impressive 47,000 new customers, but 71
percent  of  its  2,000  daily  orders  were  repeat  orders,  which  meant  Webvan
needed  to  quickly  secure  many  more  new  customers  and  reduce  its  high
customer  attrition  rate.  Making  matters  worse,  Webvan  had  scaled  its
spending based on unverified and, it turned out, highly optimistic marketing
guesses.

8. Presumption of Success Leads to Premature
Scaling

The  business  plan,  its  revenue  forecast,  and  the  product  introduction  model
assume  that  every  step  a  startup  takes  proceeds  flawlessly  and  smoothly  to
the  next.  The  model  leaves  little  room  for  error,  learning,  iteration  or

customer  feedback.  Nothing  says,  “Stop  or  slow  down  hiring  until  you
understand  customers,”  or,  “pause  to  process  customer  feedback.”  Even  the
most  experienced  executives  are  pressured  to  hire  and  staff  per  the  plan
regardless  of  progress.  This  leads  to  the  next  startup  disaster:  premature
scaling.

In large companies, the mistakes just have
additional zeros in them.

Hiring  and  spending  should  accelerate  only  after  sales  and  marketing
have become predictable, repeatable, scalable processes—not when the plan
says they’re scheduled to begin (or when the “lighthouse” account is signed
or a few sales are made).

In  large  companies,  the  mistakes  just  have  additional  zeros  in  them.
Microsoft  and  Google,  powerhouses  though  may  they  be,  launch  product
after  product—Google’s  Orkut  and  Wave,  Deskbar,  Dodgeball,  Talk  and
Finance;  Microsoft’s  “Kin,”  Vista,  Zune,  “Bob,”  WebTV,  MSNTV,
PocketPC—on rigid schedules driven by “the model” and the presumption of
success. Shortly thereafter, a lack of customer response delivers a fast, quiet
funeral for product and management alike.

At Webvan, premature scaling permeated a company culture dominated
by  the  prevailing  venture-capital  mantra  of  the  time,  “get  big  fast.”  It  spent
$18 million to develop proprietary software and $40 million to set up its first
automated warehouse before it had shipped a single item. Premature scaling
had  dire  consequences,  assuring  that  the  Webvan  case  will  be  taught  in
business schools for decades to come. As customer demand failed to live up
to Webvan’s business plan, the company slowly realized it had overbuilt and
overdesigned.  While  Webvan  had  executed  to  its  plan,  it  had  also  failed  to
pay attention to its customers.

...no business plan survives first contact with
customers.

9. Management by Crisis Leads to a Death Spiral

 
 
At Webvan, the consequences of all the mistakes began to show by the time
of first customer ship. The story usually unfolds like this:

Sales starts to miss its numbers and the board becomes concerned. The
sales  VP  arrives  at  a  board  meeting,  still  optimistic,  and  provides  a  set  of
reasonable  explanations.  The  board  raises  a  collective  eyebrow.  The  VP
returns  to  the  field  to  exhort  the  troops  to  work  harder.  Sales  asks
Engineering  to  build  custom  versions  of  the  product  for  special  customers,
since this is the only way that the increasingly desperate sales force can close
the  sale.  Board  meetings  become  increasingly  tense.  Shortly  thereafter,  the
sales VP is probably terminated as part of the “solution.”

A  new  sales  VP  hired  and  quickly  concludes  that  the  company  just
didn’t  understand  its  customers  or  how  to  sell  them.  She  decides  that  the
company’s  positioning  and  marketing  strategy  were  incorrect  and  that  the
product  was  missing  critical  features.  Since  the  new  sales  VP  was  hired  to
“fix” sales, the marketing department must now respond to a sales manager
who  believes  that  whatever  was  created  earlier  in  the  company  was  wrong.
(After all, it got the old VP fired, right?) A new sales plan buys the new sales
VP a few months’ honeymoon.

Sometimes  all  it  takes  is  one  or  two  iterations  to  find  the  right  sales
roadmap  and  positioning  to  attract  exuberant  customers.  In  tougher  times,
when dollars are tighter, the next round of funding may never come.

But  the  problem  at  Webvan  was  not  an  incorrect  sales  strategy  or
positioning  statement.  The  problem  is  that  no  business  plan  survives  first
contact with customers. The assumptions in the Webvan business plan were
simply  a  series  of  untested  hypotheses.  When  real  results  came  in,  they
learned  that  the  guesses  in  their  revenue  plan  were  wrong.  Focusing  on
executing their business plans, Webvan iterated their strategy and their search
for a business model by firing executives.

Failure is an integral part of the search for a
business model.

Webvan  went  public  in  1999,  and  its  sea  of  red  ink  was  reported
quarterly for all to see. Rather than acknowledge its unrealistic plan and scale
back  or  retrench,  the  company  kept  spending  against  its  flailing  strategy,
accumulating  a  $612  million  deficit  in  the  process.  Seven  months  after  its

 
IPO, Webvan filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

The  ironic  Webvan  postscript:  two  other  companies  on  two  continents
saw the same opportunity at the same time but developed their businesses by
following  Customer  Development  precepts  even  though  they  hadn’t  been
published  at  the  time.  Peapod  and  Tesco  are  both  successful,  growing,  and
today.  They  started  smaller,  without  carving  hypothetical
profitable 
assumptions and plans in stone, and learned what customers wanted as they
developed business and financial models that worked. Tesco, a UK company
that used retail stores as its launch pad and “warehouse,” today delivers more
than 85,000 orders a week and earns more than $559 million in sales. Peapod,
an American company, has delivered more than 10 million grocery orders to
more  than  330,000  customers.  Explicitly  or  implicitly,  both  understood  the
test-and-iterate process of Customer Development.

CHAPTER 2

The Path to the Epiphany: The Customer
Development Model

How narrow the gate and constricted the road that leads to life. And
those who find it are few.

—Matthew 7:14

WHEN WILL HARVEY APPROACHED STEVE BLANK with a new business idea
in June 2004, Steve uncharacteristically almost took out his checkbook before
hearing  Will’s  pitch.  Steve  had  invested  in  Will’s  previous  company,
There.com,  and  sat  on  its  board.  Before  that,  Will  had  been  Steve’s
engineering  VP  at  Rocket  Science,  a  video-game  company  with  Steve  as
founding  CEO.  Rocket  Science  is  infamous  for  appearing  on  the  cover  of
Wired magazine while blowing through $35 million in venture capital in less
than three years, leaving a crater so deep it has its own iridium layer.

Sitting  in  Steve’s  living  room,  Will  explained  his  vision  for  IMVU,  a
“virtual world” company with 3D avatar-based instant messaging and social
networking.  Will  had  a  world-class  reputation.  He  developed  Music
Construction Set, a worldwide best-selling video game, at the age of 15. He
earned  his  bachelor’s,  master’s  and  Ph.D.  in  computer  science  at  Stanford
while  running  a  video-game  company  that  developed  hits  like  Zany  Golf,
Immortal, and Marble Madness.

Will’s  co-founder,  Eric  Ries,  had  started  an  online  recruiting  company
while earning his computer science degree at Yale. Eric had joined Will’s last
startup as a senior software engineer. That company built a “virtual world” on
the  web  using  a  multiyear  waterfall  development  model.  After  three  years,
the product was ready to launch with a big-bang product introduction guided
by  a  hired  big  gun,  a  CEO  with  large  company  experience.  Only  then  did
they  discover  that  customers  didn’t  want  or  care  about  most  of  the  features

they had so painstakingly built.

Steve  told  the  IMVU  founders  that  in  exchange  for  his  check  to  help
fund their seed round, they were required to audit his Customer Development
class  at  U.C.  Berkeley’s  Haas  Business  School.  As  the  semester  unfolded,
Will  and  Eric  realized  that  the  Customer  Development  principles  they  were
learning would save them from repeating the same errors they made in their
previous  startup.  Thus  IMVU’s  co-founders  became  the  first  Customer
Development pioneers.

...in exchange for his check to help fund IMVU’s
seed round, they were required to audit Steve’s
Customer Development class.

Steve sat on IMVU’s board and watched, coached and cheered as Will
and  Eric  paired  the  Customer  Development  process  with  agile  software
development. They built a process that used customer feedback and testing to
help  them  determine  the  minimum  product  features  customers  most  valued.
Based  on  its  initial  set  of  hypotheses  about  its  customer,  IMVU  set  out  to
create  a  3D  chat  add-on  where  users  could  create  customizable  avatars  and
talk to all their friends on the leading instant messenger of the day, America
Online. After a year, IMVU could see that all its customer hypotheses were
wrong. While customers liked the 3D avatars, they wanted to create their own
separate  buddy  lists  instead  of  using  the  one  they  already  had  on  AOL.
IMVU learned that customers didn’t want to talk to their existing friends but
wanted to meet new people and make new friends. Quarter after quarter, this
kind  of  customer  feedback  created  a  “two  steps  forward,  one  step  back”
learning  process  that  supplied  the  Customer  Development  principles  they
learned in class.

Most startups lack a structured process for testing
their business model hypotheses.

IMVU  tested,  pivoted  and  tested  again  until  it  had  the  product  right.
Instead of creating a crisis, this learning process was an integral part of the
integrated  Customer  Development  and  agile
company. 

IMVU  had 

 
 
engineering and had become the first Lean Startup.

The result was a profitable, growing company. Why was IMVU on the
road to success while scores of other virtual world and avatar companies have
long since folded? What was it about Customer Development that gave Will
and  Eric  a  clearer  roadmap  at  IMVU  than  they  had  at  their  previous
company?

An Introduction to Customer Development

One of the things startups have lacked is a definition of who they were. For
years  we’ve  treated  startups  like  they  are  just  smaller  versions  of  a  large
company.

However,  we  now  know  that  a  startup  is  a  temporary  organization
designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model. Within this
definition,  a  startup  can  be  a  new  venture  or  it  can  be  a  new  division  or
business unit in an existing company.

If  your  business  model  is  unknown  –  that  is,  just  a  set  of  untested
hypotheses  —  you  are  a  startup  searching  for  a  repeatable  business  model.
Once  your  business  model  (market,  customers,  features,  channels,  pricing,
Get/Keep/Grow  strategy,  etc.)  is  known,  you  will  be  executing  it.  Search
versus  execution  is  what  differentiates  a  new  venture  from  an  existing
business unit.

Strategy

The term business model first appeared ~50 years ago, but the concept
didn’t  catch  on  until  the  1990’s.  It  became  common  vernacular  to  discuss

business models, but without a standard framework and vernacular, confusion
reigned.  In  2010  when  Alexander  Osterwalder  published  his  book  Business
Model Generation he provided a visual ontology and a clear vernacular that
was  sorely  needed,  and  it  became  clear  that  this  was  the  tool  to  organize
startup hypotheses.

The  primary  objective  of  a  startup  is  to  validate  its  business  model
hypotheses (and iterate and pivot until it does). Then it moves into execution
mode.  It’s  at  this  point  the  business  needs  an  operating  plan,  financial
forecasts and other well-understood management tools.

Process

Yet as powerful as the Business Model Canvas (a template with the nine
blocks  of  a  business  model)  is,  at  the  end  of  the  day  it  was  a  tool  for
brainstorming hypotheses without a formal way of testing them.

The  processes  used  to  organize  and  implement  the  search  for  the
business model are Customer Development and Agile Development. A search
for a business model can be in any new business – in a brand new startup new
or in a new division of an existing company.

The Customer Development model depicted in Figure 2.1 breaks out all
the  customer-related  activities  of  an  early-stage  company  into  four  easy-to-
understand steps. The first two steps of the process outline the “search” for

the business model. Steps three and four “execute” the business model that’s
been developed, tested, and proven in steps one and two. The steps:

Customer discovery first captures the founders’ vision and turns it into a
series  of  business  model  hypotheses.  Then  it  develops  a  plan  to  test
customer reactions to those hypotheses and turn them into facts
Customer  validation  tests  whether  the  resulting  business  model  is
repeatable and scalable. If not, you return to customer discovery
Customer creation  is  the  start  of  execution.  It  builds  end-user  demand
and drives it into the sales channel to scale the business
Company-building  transitions  the  organization  from  a  startup  to  a
company focused on executing a validated model

In  search,  you  want  a  process  designed  to  be  dynamic,  so  you  work  with  a
rough business model description knowing it will change. The model changes
because  startups  use  customer  development  to  run  experiments  to  test  the
hypotheses that make up the model. And most of the time these experiments
fail. Search embraces failure as a natural part of the startup process. Unlike
existing  companies  that  fire  executives  when  they  fail  to  match  a  plan,  we
keep the founders and change the model.
The specific processes associated with the two search steps are described in
the following pages.

Once  a  company  has  found  a  business  model  (it  knows  its  market,
customers,  product/service,  channel,  pricing,  etc.),  the  organization  moves
from search to execution.

The  product  execution  process  –  managing  the  life  cycle  of  existing
products  and  the  launch  of  follow-on  products  –  is  the  job  of  the  product
management  and  engineering  organizations.  It  results  in  a  linear  process
where you make a plan and refine it into detail. The more granularity you add
to a plan, the better people can execute it: a Business Requirement document
(BRD)  leads  to  a  Market  Requirements  Document  (MRD)  and  then  gets
handed  off  to  engineering  as  a  Functional  Specifications  Document  (FSD)
implemented via Agile or Waterfall development.

Organization

Searching  for  a  business  model  requires  a  different  organization  than
the  one  used  to  execute  a  plan.  Searching  requires  the  company  to  be
organized  around  a  customer  development  team  led  by  the  founders.  In
contrast,  execution  (which  follows  search)  requires  the  company  to  be
organized  by  function  (product  management,  sales,  marketing,  business
development, etc.).

Companies  in  execution  suffer  from  a  “fear  of  failure  culture“  (quite
understandable since they were hired to execute a known job spec.) Startups
with Customer Development Teams have a “learning and discovery” culture
for search. The fear of making a move before the last detail is nailed down is
one of the biggest problems existing companies have when they need to learn
how to search.

The idea of not  having  a  functional  organization  until  the  organization
has  found  a  proven  business  model  is  one  of  the  hardest  things  for  new
startups  to  grasp.  There  are  no  sales,  marketing  or  business  development
departments  when  you  are  searching  for  a  business  model.  If  you’ve
organized  your  startup  with  those  departments,  you  are  not  really  doing
customer  development.  (It’s  like  trying  to  implement  a  startup  using
Waterfall engineering.)

Customer Development Process (Figure 2.1)

“The Search for a Business Model:” Steps, Iteration
and Pivots

In  the  Customer  Development  model,  each  step  is  represented  as  a  circular
track with recursive arrows in order to highlight that each step is iterative. It’s
a polite way of saying, “Startups are unpredictable. We will have failures and
we will screw it up several times before we get it right.”

In  contrast,  a  traditional  product  introduction  plan  makes  no  provision
for  moving  backward.  To  do  so  would  be  considered  a  failure.  No  wonder
most startup founders are embarrassed when they’re out in the field learning,
failing, and learning some more. The diagram their boards of directors have
beaten  into  them  says,  “Move  from  left  to  right  and  you’re  a  success.  Go
right  to  left  and  you’ll  get  fired.”  This  is  why  startup  sales  and  marketing
efforts  tend  to  move  forward  even  when  it’s  patently  obvious  that  they
haven’t nailed the market. Experience with scores of startups shows that only
in  business-school  case  studies  does  progress  addressing  customers’  key
needs happen in a smooth, linear fashion.

Meanwhile,  the  Customer  Development  model  embraces  the  way
startups actually work, with moving backward playing a natural and valuable
role  in  learning  and  discovery.  Startups  will  cycle  through  each  step  of  the
Customer  Development  process  until  they  achieve  “escape  velocity”—
enough  measurable  progress  in  finding  the  business  model  as  defined  by
board and team—to propel forward to the next step.

...what could customers tell us except that we were
right?

Eric Ries recalls his pre-IMVU days at There.com: “The company sort
of  wanted  customer  feedback  but  not  really.  From  our  perspective,  what
could customers tell us except that we were right? The marketing team held
focus groups, but looking back, they were orchestrated to get the answers we
wanted  to  hear.”  The  Customer  Development  model  assumes  it  will  take
several iterations of each of the four steps to get it right. The philosophy of
“It’s  not  only  OK  to  screw  it  up—plan  to  learn  from  it”  is  the  core  of  the
process.

Note that each of the four steps has a stop sign at its exit. That’s simply
a reminder to think through whether enough has been learned to charge ahead
to  the  next  step.  It’s  a  place  to  stop  and  summarize  all  the  learning  and,  of
course,  to  candidly  assess  whether  the  company  has  reached  “escape

 
velocity.”

Let’s  take  a  closer  look  at  each  of  the  four  steps  of  the  Customer

Development model.

Step 1: Customer Discovery

Customer  discovery  translates  a  founder’s  vision  for  the  company  into
hypotheses about each component of the business model and creates a set of
experiments  to  test  each  hypothesis.  To  do  this,  founders  leave  guesswork
behind  and  get  out  of  the  building  to  test  customer  reaction  to  each
hypothesis, gain insights from their feedback, and adjust the business model.
Of all the lessons of Customer Development, the importance of getting out of
the building and into conversations with your customers is the most critical.
Only  by  moving  away  from  the  comforts  of  your  conference  room  to  truly
engage with and listen to your customers can you learn in depth about their
problems,  product  features  they  believe  will  solve  those  problems,  and  the
process  in  their  company  for  recommending,  approving  and  purchasing
products.  You’ll  need  these  details  to  build  a  successful  product,  articulate
your product’s unique differences and propose a compelling reason why your
customers should buy it.

Customer discovery is not about collecting feature lists from prospective
customers  or  running  lots  of  focus  groups.  In  a  startup,  the  founders  define
the product vision and then use customer discovery to find customers and a
market  for  that  vision.  (Read  that  last  sentence  again.  The  initial  product
specification comes from the founders’ vision, not the sum of a set of focus
groups.)

In a startup, the founders define the product vision
and then use customer discovery to find customers
and a market for that vision.

Customer discovery includes two outside-the-building phases. The first
tests customer perception of the problem and the customer’s need to solve it.
Is it important enough that the right product will drive significant numbers of
customers  to  buy  or  engage  with  the  product?  The  second  phase  shows

 
customers the product for the first time, assuring that the product (usually a
minimum  viable  product  at  this  point)  elegantly  solves  the  problem  or  fills
the need well enough to persuade lots of customers to buy. When customers
enthusiastically confirm the importance of both the problem and the solution,
customer discovery is complete.

Pivots  may  happen  in  the  customer  discovery  phase.  Failure  will
happen.  It  is  a  normal  part  of  the  startup  process.  Misunderstanding  or  just
getting wrong key assumptions about your business model happen often: who
your customers are, what problems they needed to solve, what features would
solve them, how much customers would pay to solve them, etc. Pivots are a
response  to  these  mistakes.  A  pivot  is  a  major  change  to  one  of  the  nine
business model hypotheses based on learning from customer feedback. Pivots
happen often in the Customer Development process. A pivot is not a failure.
In fact, embracing the fact that startups regularly fail and pivot along the way
is perhaps one of the greatest insights in this book.

 For web/mobile apps, or products, customer discovery begins when
the first “low-fidelity” version of the website or app is up and running. The
website  is  used  to  test  the  business  model  hypotheses  against  customers  or
users. When the product is bits, a rough minimum viable product can often be
assembled  in  days  if  not  hours,  and  entrepreneurs  can  start  the  search  for
customers  almost  at  once,  refining  their  product  and  customer-acquisition
strategies  on  the  fly.  This  approach  served  many  recent  startup  stars  quite
well, including Facebook and Groupon, which began the quest for customers
with rough-hewn products almost the day they opened their doors.

A pivot is not a failure.

Another key element of customer discovery is that the founder is free to
ignore all of it. At times (particularly in a new market) a founder’s vision of
what can be is clearer than the vision of potential customers. But this corner
case requires the founder to be able to articulate the “why,” not just ignore it.
The  IMVU  team  shipped  a  buggy  minimalist  product  quickly  and
deployed a whopping marketing budget of $5 a day, using Google AdWords
to attract roughly 100 new daily users to the site. They vigilantly observed,
monitored and assessed every user’s on-site behavior. Heavy (paying) users
were then assaulted with questions in online chats, surveys, phone calls from

 
founders  and  more.  Perhaps  the  ugliest  (or  most  flattering)  comment:  “It
seems  to  crash  my  computer  every  time  I  use  it,”  said  one  user  who  kept
coming  back  for  more!  But  four  months  after  funding,  a  (clearly  minimal)
new  product  was  born,  using  feedback  reflecting  the  power  of  customer
discovery.

Step 2: Customer Validation

Customer validation proves that the business tested and iterated in customer
discovery  has  a  repeatable,  scalable  business  model  that  can  deliver  the
volume  of  customers  required  to  build  a  profitable  company.  During
validation,  the  company  tests  its  ability  to  scale  (i.e.,  product,  customer
acquisition,  pricing  and  channel  activities)  against  a  larger  number  of
customers  with  another  round  of  tests,  that  are  larger  in  scale  and  more
rigorous  and  quantitative.  During  this  step,  a  startup  also  develops  a  sales
roadmap for the sales and marketing teams (to be hired later) or validates the
online  demand  creation  plan.  Simply  put,  does  adding  $1  in  sales  and
marketing  resources  generate  $2+  of  revenue  (or  users,  views,  clicks,  or
whatever the metric may be)? The resulting roadmap will be field-tested here
by selling the product to early customers.

 In web/mobile apps, customer validation calls for the deployment of
a “hi-fidelity” version of the MVP to test key features in front of customers.
Customer validation proves the existence of a set of customers, confirms that
customers  will  accept  the  MVP,  and  validates  serious,  measurable  purchase
intent among customers.

How? Depending on the business model, validation is measured by “test
sales”  that  get  customers  to  hand  over  their  money  (or  become  actively
engaged with the product). In a single-sided market (one where the user is the
payer), a steady stream of customer purchases validates the concept far more
solidly than lots of polite words. There’s no surrogate for people paying for a
product. In a “two-sided” or ad-supported business model, a customer base of
hundreds of thousands that’s growing exponentially usually implies that the
company can find a set of advertisers willing to pay to reach those users.

In  essence,  the  first  two  steps  in  the  Customer  Development  model—
customer discovery and customer validation—refine, corroborate, and test a
startup’s  business  model.  Completing  these  first  two  steps  verifies  the

product’s  core  features,  the  market’s  existence,  locates  customers,  tests  the
product’s  perceived  value  and  demand,  identifies  the  economic  buyer  (the
person  who  writes  the  check  to  buy  the  product),  establishes  pricing  and
channel strategies, and checks out the proposed sales cycle and process. Only
when an adequately sized group of customers and a repeatable sales process
that yields a profitable business model are clearly identified and validated is
“escape  velocity”  achieved.  At  that  point,  it’s  time  to  move  on  to  the  next
step: scaling up, also known as customer creation.

Learning that a hypothesis is wrong is not a crisis.

In  Will’s  and  Eric’s  pre-IMVU  startup,  their  CEO  and  board  forced
them  to  wait  three  years  and  spend  $30  million  to  perfect  the  product  with
minimal  customer  feedback.  By  contrast,  IMVU  launched  a  buggy  early
product roughly 120 days after it was founded. Amazingly, some customers
loved  the  buggy  product  enough  not  only  to  pay  for  it,  but  also  to  give  the
founders what they wanted: feedback (and money).

The  IMVU  team  used  customer  feedback  relentlessly  to  drive  the
enhancement,  addition  and  deletion  of  features  that  “heavy  users”  liked  or
didn’t. One critical pricing discovery led to a 30 percent increase in revenue.
When teenagers bemoaned their lack of access to credit cards, IMVU reacted
quickly by allowing users to pay IMVU via gift cards distributed through 7-
Eleven and Walmart, online, and via other major retail channels.

A Customer Development Bonus: Minimum Waste of Cash and Time

The  first  two  Customer  Development  steps  limit  the  amount  of  money  a
startup spends until it has tested and validated a business model and is ready
to scale. Instead of hiring sales and marketing staff, leasing new buildings or
buying ads, startup founders get out of the building to test the business model
hypotheses, and that costs very little in cash.

When paired with agile engineering, Customer Development reduces the
amount of wasted code, features or hardware. Agile development builds the
product  in  small  increments,  allowing  the  company  to  test  and  measure
customer reactions  to  each  new  iteration  of  the  product.  It  won’t  take  three
years to find out that customers don’t want or need or can’t use the features
the team labored lovingly over.

 
Since  the  Customer  Development  model  assumes  that  most  startups
cycle  through  discovery  and  validation  multiple  times,  it  allows  a  well-
managed company to carefully estimate and frugally husband its cash. It also
helps  “husband”  founders’  equity,  since  the  closer  a  company  is  to  a
predictable,  scalable  business  model,  the  higher  its  likely  valuation—
preserving  more  stock  for  the  founders  at  fundraising  time.  The  IMVU
founders,  for  example,  only  hired  product  development  teams  (not  sales,
marketing,  or  business  development)  until  they  had  proof  in  hand  of  a
business worth building. With that proof, the company can move through the
third and fourth steps, customer creation and company-building, to capitalize
on the opportunity.

Step 3: Customer Creation

Customer  creation  builds  on  the  company’s  initial  sales  success.  It’s  where
the company steps on the gas, spending large sums to scale by creating end-
user demand and driving it into the sales channel. This step follows customer
validation, moving heavy marketing spending after a startup has learned how
to  acquire  customers,  thus  controlling  the  cash  burn  rate  to  protect  a  most
precious “green” asset, cash.

Customer  creation  varies  by  startup  type.  Some  startups  enter  existing
markets well-defined by their competitors, others create new markets where
no  product  or  company  exists,  and  still  others  attempt  a  hybrid  by  re-
segmenting  an  existing  market  as  a  low-cost  entrant  or  by  creating  a  niche.
Each market-type strategy demands different customer creation activities and
costs. (Market type is addressed in depth later.)

Initially,  IMVU  ran  a  wide  range  of  low-cost  customer  segmentation
experiments. Soon they identified two distinct customer segments—teens and
moms—and  spending  ramped  up  to  underwrite  two  entirely  different
customer creation efforts.

Step 4: Company-Building

“Graduation  day”  arrives  when  the  startup  finds  a  scalable,  repeatable
business  model.  At  this  point  it’s  fundamentally  no  longer  the  temporary
search-oriented  organization  known  as  a  startup—it’s  a  company!  In  a

sometimes-bittersweet  transition  out  of  startup  mode,  company-building
refocuses  the  team’s  energy  away  from  “search”  mode  and  to  a  focus  on
execution, swapping its informal learning- and discovery-oriented Customer
Development  team  for  formal,  structured  departments  such  as  Sales,
Marketing  and  Business  Development,  among  others,  complete  with  VPs.
These  executives  now  focus  on  building  their  departments  to  scale  the
company.

This  is  where  the  entrepreneurs’  version  of  a  Shakespearean  tragedy
often takes center stage, as VCs realize they have a “hit” with potential for a
large  return  on  their  investment.  All  of  a  sudden,  the  passionate  visionary
entrepreneur is no longer deemed the right person to lead the now-successful
company he or she has nurtured from cocktail napkin to high-trajectory. The
board—graciously  or  not—ousts  the  founder  and  all  his  or  her  innate
customer  understanding,  trading  him  or  her  in  for  a  “suit,”  an  experienced
operating executive. There goes the neighborhood, as the company declares
success,  the  entrepreneurial  spark  often  sputters,  and  process  often  drowns
energy.

At  IMVU,  the  founders  saw  the  company  rapidly  scaling  beyond  their
skill set. But instead of being fired, they recognized the need for a seasoned
operating  executive,  recruited  a  skilled  CEO,  and  named  themselves
chairmen of the board and active board members. Their new CEO was skilled
at  managing  the  transition  from  searching  for  a  business  to  execution  and
grew the company steadily.

CHAPTER 3

The Customer Development Manifesto

BEFORE  DIVING  HEADFIRST  INTO  THE  DETAILS of the Customer Development
process,  it’s  crucial  to  review  the  14  rules  that  make  up  The  Customer
Development Manifesto. Embrace them. Review them regularly with the team
and (maybe after the IPO) consider perhaps even etching them in marble at
world headquarters.

Rule No. 1:

There Are No Facts Inside Your Building, So Get
Outside.

On  Day  One,  the  startup  is  a  faith-based  enterprise  built  on  its  founders’
vision  and  a  notable  absence  of  facts.  The  founders’  job  is  to  translate  this
vision and these hypotheses into facts. Facts live outside the building, where
future customers (prospects, really) live and work, so that’s where you need
to go. Nothing is more fundamental to Customer Development, and nothing
is harder to do. It’s much easier to write code, build hardware, have meetings
and write reports than it is to find and listen to potential customers. But that’s
what separates the winners from the losers.

Facts live outside the building, where future
customers live and work...

In  Customer  Development,  the  founders  gather  firsthand  experience
about  every  component  of  the  business  model.  The  team  can  support  the
founders,  but  firsthand  experience  by  definition  cannot  be  delegated.  This

 
customer research must be done by founders because:

Key  customer  feedback  points  are  random,  unpredictable,  and  often
painful to hear. Employees hate to deliver bad news to higher-ups

Employees have far less at stake and seldom listen as acutely, and they
don’t  get  heard  adequately  when  they  report  back.  It’s  too  easy  to
dismiss  their  findings  as  “hearsay”  or  to  ignore  critical  points  of
feedback

Consultants have even less at stake than employees and often color their
commentary  to  either  tell  the  client  what  he  wants  to  hear  or  deliver
messages that can lead to extended consulting relationships. This is also
second-  or  third-hand  feedback  and  too  diluted  or  diffused  to  provide
value

Only a founder can embrace the feedback, react to it, and adeptly make

the decisions necessary to change or pivot key business model components.

Rule No. 2:

Pair Customer Development with Agile
Development

Customer Development is useless unless the product
development organization can iterate the product
with speed and agility.

Customer  Development 
the  product  development
is  useless  unless 
organization  can  iterate  the  product  with  speed  and  agility.  If  Engineering
builds  the  product  using  waterfall  development,  it  will  be  deaf,  dumb  and
blind to customer input except during a short period when it’s specifying the
product.  The  rest  of  the  time,  engineers  are  locked  into  an  implementation
cycle,  unable  to  change  the  product  features  without  intolerable  delay.  By
contrast,  a  startup  engineering  organization  using  an  agile  methodology  is

 
designed to continually take customer input and deliver a product that iterates
readily around an MVP or its minimum feature set.

In  this  book,  agile  engineering/development  refers  to  the  rapid
deployment,  iterative  development  and  continuous  discovery  processes  that
hardware  or  software  companies  can  use.  We  don’t  advocate  any  particular
flavor,  just  its  necessity.  The  Customer  Development  process  provides  the
continuous customer input to make agile work.

Before the company even starts, the founders need to reach a deep and

inexorable commitment to the customer/agile development partnership.

Rule No. 3:

Failure is an Integral Part of the Search

One of the key differences between a startup and an existing company is the
one that’s never explicitly stated: “startups go from failure to failure.”

In  contrast,  existing  companies  have  learned  what  works  and  doesn’t.
Failures  in  an  existing  company  are  an  exception.  They  happen  when
someone  screws  up.  In  a  startup,  you’re  searching,  not  executing,  and  the
only way to find the right path is to try lots of experiments and take a lot of
wrong turns. Failure is part of the process.

If you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined
to do so.

Failures  are  not  truly  failures,  per  se  but  an  integral  part  of  the  startup
learning process. You’ll be running dozens if not hundreds of pass/fail tests
—on your pitch, your features, your pricing, and on and on—so get ready to
accept  failure  and  move  on.  When  something  isn’t  working,  successful
founders orient themselves to the new facts, decide what needs fixing, and act
decisively.

The  Customer  Development  process  demands  frequent,  agile  iteration,
followed,  of  course,  by  testing  of  the  iteration  that  often  leads  to  another
iteration or pivot, which leads to more testing and...

If you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined to do so.

 
Rule No. 4:

Make Continuous Iterations and Pivots

The  strategy  of  embracing  failure  in  Customer  Development  demands
frequent, agile iteration and pivots. A pivot is a substantive change in one or
more of the nine boxes of the business model canvas. (For example, a pricing
change  from  freemium  to  subscription  model  or  a  customer  segment  shift
from  boys  12-15  years  old  to  women  45-60.)  Or  it  can  be  more  complex,
such as a change of target customer or user. Iterations, meanwhile, are minor
changes  to  business  model  components  (e.g.,  changing  pricing  from  $99  to
$79).

Groupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot is a perfect
example.

When  a  company  is  limping  along,  only  a  dramatic  change  to  one  or
more  business  model  components  can  get  it  back  on  the  road  to  success.
Groupon’s  legendary  $12  billion  pivot  (their  IPO  valuation)  is  a  perfect
example.  Groupon  was  started  from  a  company  called  the  Point.  It  was
struggling, at best, as a social media platform working to get people together
to solve problems, but was about to run out of money.

The most effective campaigns on The Point were those that saved people
money  by  grouping  or  bundling  their  purchases.  The  founders  started
blogging various deals from different businesses each day. They called this,
“Get Your Groupon.com.” Groupon’s first offer hit in October of 2008: buy
two pizzas for the  price  of  one  in  the  shop  on  the  first  floor  of  its  Chicago
headquarters. Twenty  people bought the deal and the company was well on
its way to its $12-billion pivot.

Pivots are driven by the learnings and insight from a continuous stream

of “pass/fail” tests you run throughout discovery and validation.

The best startup founders don’t hesitate to make the change. They admit

when hypotheses are wrong and adapt.

Rule No. 5:

 
No Business Plan Survives First Contact with
Customers So Use a Business Model Canvas

financing, 

the  business  plan 

There’s  only  one  reason  for  a  business  plan:  some  investor  who  went  to
business school doesn’t know any better and wants to see one. But once it has
delivered 
fundamentally  useless.
Entrepreneurs often mistake their business plan as a cookbook for execution,
failing to recognize that it is only a collection of unproven assumptions. At its
back, a revenue plan blessed by an investor, and composed overwhelmingly
of  guesses,  suddenly  becomes  an  operating  plan  driving  hiring,  firing,  and
spending. Insanity.

is 

The difference between a static business plan and a
dynamic model could well be the difference between
flameout and success.

The  difference  between  a  static  business  plan  and  a  dynamic  business
model could well be the difference between a flameout and success. Startups
should dump the business plan and adopt the flexible business model.

A  business  model  describes  the  flow  between  key  components  of  the

company:

value proposition, which the company offers (product/service, benefits)

customer segments, such as users, and payers, or moms or teens

distribution  channels  to  reach  customers  and  offer  them  the  value
proposition

customer relationships to create demand

revenue streams generated by the value proposition(s)

resources needed to make the business model possible

activities necessary to implement the business model

partners who participate in the business and their motivations for doing
so

 
cost structure resulting from the business model

The business model canvas (see Figure 3.1) presents a visual overview
of  the  nine  components  of  a  business  on  one  page.  In  this  book,  Alexander
Osterwalder’s business model canvas serves as the scorecard for the customer
discovery process described in Step One. Osterwalder’s book Business Model
Generation (Wiley, 2010) provides the structure for the canvas.

Business Model Canvas (Figure 3.1)

As a startup moves through the Customer Development process, it will
use  the  business  model  canvas  as  a  scorecard,  by  posting  the  hypotheses

about each component of the model and then revising the hypotheses as the
founders  gather  facts.  Think  of  your  first  version  of  the  business  model
canvas as the starting point showing the hypotheses that must be confirmed in
face-to-face  or  online  interaction  with  customers.  More  often  than  not,  the
customers  will  reject  components  of  the  business  model,  saying,  “I’d  rather
buy that from a retailer,” or, “The product needs to have these features to be
important  to  me.”  As  customers  approve  or  dispute  the  business  model
hypotheses, the company either accepts the customers’ approval or pivots to
change its business model to better target the opportunity.

Using the business model canvas as a guide makes it easier to figure out
where and how to pivot, since the team can visually diagram its alternatives
and see what it needs to change. Each time the founders iterate or pivot (see
Rule  No.  4)  in  response  to  customer  feedback,  they  draw  a  new  canvas
showing the changes. Over time, these multiple canvases form a “flip book”
that  shows  the  evolution  of  the  business  model.  Agile  startups  can  end  up
with a six-inch-thick stack of business model diagrams they can burn at the
IPO-celebration bonfire.

Much more about how to use business model diagrams to “keep score”

throughout the customer discovery process can be found in Chapter 4.

...hypothesis is just a fancy word for “guess.”

Rule No. 6:

Design Experiments and Test to Validate Your
Hypotheses

Initially, hypothesis is just a fancy word for “guess.” To turn hypotheses into
facts,  founders  need  to  get  out  of  the  building  and  test  them  in  front  of
customers.  But  how  do  you  test?  And  what  do  you  want  to  learn  from  the
tests? Testing and learning require you to be thoughtful on constructing and
designing your tests. We call this “designing the experiments.”

Customer  Development  experiments  are  short,  simple,  objective
pass/fail  tests.  You’re  looking  for  a  strong  signal  in  the  signal/noise  noise

 
ratio, something like five of the first 12 customers you call on saying “I need
this right now, even if it’s still buggy.” Early tests aren’t necessarily precise,
but should give you a “good enough” signal to proceed.

The Customer Development Insight Cycle (Figure 3.2)

Start  by  asking  yourself,  “What  insight  do  I  need  to  move  forward?”
Then ask, “What’s the simplest test I can run to get it?” Finally, think about,
“How do I design an experiment to run this simple test?”

One  of  the  things  that  trips  up  engineering  founders  is  thinking  that

these tests have to be actual code, hardware or the real product. Most of the
time you can mock-up the web page or create a demo or physical prototype to
elicit valuable learning.

Rule No. 7:

Agree on Market Type. It Changes Everything

One of the radical insights guiding this book is that not all startups are alike.
One of the key ways in which they are different is in the relationship between
a  startup’s  new  product  and  its  market.  These  product/market  relationships
generally fit one of these descriptions:

bringing a new product into an existing market

bringing a new product into a new market

bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to:

re-segment that market as a low-cost entrant or

re-segment that market as a niche entrant

cloning a business model that’s successful in another country

What confused entrepreneurs for decades is that the traditional product
introduction model works when introducing a product into an existing market
with a known business model (i.e., known customers, channels and markets).
However,  since  the  majority  of  startups  are  not  pursuing  known  markets
(those in new or re-segmented categories), they don’t really know who their
customers will be. These types of startups are searching for a repeatable and
scalable business model.

Market type influences everything a company does.

Market type influences everything a company does. Strategy and tactics
that  work  for  one  market  type  seldom  work  for  another.  Market  type
determines  the  startup’s  customer  feedback  and  acquisition  activities  and
spending.  It  changes  customer  needs,  adoption  rates,  product  features  and

 
positioning  as  well  as  its  launch  strategies,  channels  and  activities.  In  sum,
different  market  types  require  dramatically  different  discovery,  MVPs,  and
sales and marketing strategies.

In  existing  markets,  where  customers  exist,  marketing  is  relatively  easy:
users can describe the market and the attributes that matter the most to them.
The  new  product  or  service  typically  runs  faster,  does  something  better  or
cheaper,  or  otherwise  improves  on  a  customer-defined  attribute.  Users,  the
market, and competitors are known, and competition involves comparing the
product and its features with others.

In a new market, a company lets customers do something they couldn’t do
before  by  creating  something  that  never  existed  before.  Or  it  dramatically
lowers costs to create a new class of users. By definition, new markets have
no customers yet, so there’s nobody to know what the product can do or why
they  should  buy.  This  makes  getting  feedback  and  creating  demand
particularly  challenging,  since  the  product  is  unknown  to  users  and  the
market is undefined and unknown, and costly to develop.

The  key  isn’t  competing,  but  instead  understanding  whether  a  large
customer  base  exists  and  whether  customers  can  be  persuaded  to  buy.  A
classic founder error in a new market is the “fast-burn” spending of sales and
marketing funds, a practice that may be appropriate when selling to existing
customers in a known market, but makes no sense in a new market. The new-
vs.-existing axis is at the core of the market-type definition.

Re-segmenting  an  existing  market  is  useful  when  the  incumbent  is  too
difficult  to  attack  head-on  (like  Amazon,  Facebook,  or  Microsoft).  A  re-
segmentation  strategy  is  based  on  the  startup’s  market  and  customer
knowledge,  ideally  identifying  a  market  opportunity  that  incumbents  are
missing, which usually takes one of two forms: a low-cost strategy or a niche
strategy.  (Unlike  differentiation,  segmentation  forges  a  distinct  spot  in
customers’ minds that is unique, valuable, and in demand.)

Low-cost  re-segmentation  is  just  what  it  sounds  like.  Are  there
customers at the low end of an existing market who will buy “good enough”
performance at a substantially lower price?

Niche  re-segmentation  looks  at  an  existing  market  and  asks  whether
some segment of this market would buy a new product designed to address
more  specific  needs.  Can  some  sizable  portion  of  the  market  be  convinced
that a characteristic of the new product is radical enough to change the rules

and  shape  of  an  existing  market.  See  Chan  Kim  and  Renee  Mauborgne’s
work on “Blue Ocean Strategy” for another way to think of re-segmenting a
market.

Cloning  an  existing  business  model  is  a  powerful  technique  when  an
existing  business  has  been  proven  in  one  country  but  has  not  yet  been
introduced in another. Startups in Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan and
China  (each  with  its  own  large  local  market  and  language  and  cultural
barriers)  can  adopt,  borrow,  or  copy  a  successful  American  business  model
and customize it for local language and buying preferences. (Soon ideas from
those countries will be cloned in the U.S.)

For example, Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia are the equivalent of
Google  in  their  respective  markets.  And  Qzone,  RenRen,  PengYou  and
Kaixin are the Facebooks of China, while Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki play
the same role in Russia.

Startup  companies  generally  enter  one  of  these  four  market  types  and
ultimately  must  commit  to  one.  The  consequences  of  a  wrong  market-type
choice will prove to be severe in the customer creation stage. While market
type is ultimately a “late-binding decision,” a working hypothesis helps frame
early customer discovery issues. Market-type decision-making is explored in
greater detail in Chapter 4.

...the few financial metrics to track: cash-burn rate,
number of months’ worth of cash left...

Rule No. 8:

Startup Metrics Differ from Those in Existing
Companies

We  now  have  several  centuries’  worth  of  performance  metrics  for  existing
businesses—P&Ls  balance  sheets,  cash-flow  forecasts  and  line-of-business
analyses,  plus  scores  of  others.  Here’s  hoping  your  startup  becomes  big
enough to need them someday. In the past (not so long ago), we used these

 
tools  with  startups  because  we  didn’t  know  what  else  to  measure.  We  now
know  that  startup  metrics  should  focus  on  tracking  the  startup’s  progress
converting  guesses  and  hypotheses  into  incontrovertible  facts  rather  than
measuring  the  execution  of  a  static  plan.  It’s  critical  that  board  and
management  continuously  test  and  measure  each  hypothesis  until  the  entire
business model is worth scaling into a company.

If the company is venture-backed, management and investors must agree
on a set of metrics that truly matter and work toward a report or “dashboard”
that  essentially  replaces  the  P&L,  cash  flow,  and  balance  sheet  as
centerpieces of early board meetings.
Startup metrics track the results of pass/fail tests and the iterations they lead
to:

Have the customer problem and product features been validated?

Does the minimum feature set resonate with customers?

Who  in  fact  is  the  customer,  and  have  initial  customer-related
hypotheses  on  the  likes  of  value  proposition,  customer  segments,  and
channels been validated through face-to-face customer interaction?

Customer-validation  questions  might  include:  average  order  size,
customer lifetime value, average time to first order, rate of sales pipeline
growth, improvement in close rate, and revenue per salesperson.

In  addition  to  the  startup  metrics  above,  the  relatively  few  financial
metrics that a startup board should be tracking are cash-burn rate, number of
months’ worth of cash left, short-term hiring plans, and amount of time until
the company reaches cash-flow break-even.

Make sure decisions are fact-based, not faith-based.

Rule No. 9:

Fast Decision-Making, Cycle Time, Speed and
Tempo

 
Speed  matters  at  startups  where  the  only  absolute  certainty  is  that  the  bank
balance declines every day. While Rule No. 4 addresses iterations and pivots,
it  doesn’t  specify  how  long  they  should  take.  Unequivocally,  the  faster  the
better,  since  the  faster  these  “learn,  build,  pivot”  or  “iterate,  build”  cycles
happen,  the  greater  the  odds  of  finding  a  scalable  business  model  with  the
cash  on  hand.  If  cycles  happen  too  slowly,  the  startup  runs  out  of  cash  and
dies.  The  biggest  impediment  to  cycle  time  is  psychological:  it  requires  the
admission of being wrong or even of suffering a short-term tactical defeat.

While pivots and iterations are about speed outside the building, speed
also matters inside the company. Most startup decisions are made in the face
of  uncertainty.  There’s  seldom  a  clear-cut,  perfect  solution  to  any
engineering,  customer  or  competitor  problem,  and  founders  shouldn’t
agonize  over  trying  to  find  one.  This  doesn’t  mean  gambling  with  the
company’s fortunes on a whim. It means adopting plans with an acceptable
degree  of  risk  and  doing  so  quickly.  (Make  sure  these  decisions  are  fact-
based, not faith-based.) In general, the company that consistently makes and
implements decisions rapidly gains a tremendous, often-decisive competitive
advantage.

...startups should make reversible decisions before
anyone leaves the CEO’s office.

Startup  decisions  have  two  states:  reversible  and  irreversible.  A
reversible  decision  could  be  adding  or  dropping  a  product  feature  or  a  new
algorithm in the code or targeting a specific set of customers. If the decision
proves  a  bad  one,  it  can  be  unwound  in  a  reasonable  period  of  time.  An
irreversible  decision  such  as  firing  an  employee,  launching  a  product,  or
signing  a  long  lease  on  expensive  office  space  is  usually  difficult  or
impossible to reverse.

Startups  should  as  policy,  make  reversible  decisions  before  anyone
leaves the CEO’s office or before a meeting ends. Perfect decision-making is
both  unimportant  and  impossible,  and  what  matters  more  is  forward
momentum  and  a  tight,  fact-based  feedback  loop  to  quickly  recognize  and
reverse bad decisions. By the time a big company gets the committee to get
the  subcommittee  to  pick  a  meeting  date,  most  startups  have  made  20
decisions, reversed five, and implemented the other 15.

 
Learning  to  make  decisions  quickly  is  just  part  of  the  equation.  Agile
startups  have  mastered  another  trick:  tempo—the  ability  to  make  quick
decisions consistently and at all levels in the company. Speed and tempo are
integral parts of startup DNA, and a great startup’s tempo is often 10 times
that of a large company.

Rule No. 10:

It’s All About Passion

A startup without driven, passionate people is dead the day it opens its doors.
“Startup people” are different. They think different. In contrast, most people
are great at execution. They work to live, do their jobs well, and enjoy their
family,  their  lives,  their  hobbies  and  often  even  enjoy  mowing  the  lawn.
They’re terrific at executing fixed tasks, and it’s a wonderful life for almost
everyone.

The  people  leading  almost  every  successful  startup  in  history  are  just
different.  They’re  a  very  tiny  percentage  of  the  world  population,  and  their
brains  are  wired  for  chaos,  uncertainty,  and  blinding  speed.  They’re
irrationally  focused  on  customer  needs  and  delivering  great  products.  Their
job  is  their  life.  It’s  not  9-to-5,  it’s  24/7.  These  are  the  people  who  found
high-growth, highly-successful scalable startups.

Startups demand execs who are comfortable with
uncertainty, chaos and change.

Rule No. 11:

Startup Job Titles Are Very Different from a Large
Company’s

In  an  existing  company,  job  titles  reflect  the  way  tasks  are  organized  to

 
execute a known business model. For example, the “Sales” title in an existing
company means there’s a sales team repeatedly selling a known product to a
well-understood group of customers, using a standard corporate presentation
with  an  existing  price  list  and  standard  terms,  conditions  and  contract.  The
“Sales” title in an existing company is all about execution around a series of
knowns.

Compared with big companies, startups need executives whose skills are
180  degrees  different.  Startups  demand  execs  who  are  comfortable  with
uncertainty,  chaos  and  change—with  presentations  and  offers  changing
daily,  with  the  product  changing  often,  with  probing  and  gaining  insights
from  failure  rather  than  high-fiving  a  success.  In  short,  they  need  the  rare
breed:

open to learning and discovery—highly curious, inquisitive, and creative

eager to search for a repeatable and scalable business model

agile enough to deal with daily change and operating “without a map”

readily able to wear multiple hats, often on the same day

comfortable celebrating failure when it leads to learning and iteration

We suggest replacing traditional execution-oriented sales, marketing and
business  development  titles  with  a  single  title:  the  Customer  Development
team. At first, this “team” will consist of the company’s founder(s), who talks
with  customers  to  gain  enough  insights  to  develop  the  minimum  viable
product. Later, as the startup moves into customer validation, the team may
grow  to  include  a  dedicated  “sales  closer”  responsible  for  the  logistics  of
getting  early  orders  signed.  The  closer  shouldn’t  be  confused  with  a
traditional sales VP. To succeed in this process, the team must have:

the ability to listen to customer objections and understand whether they
are issues about the product, the presentation, the pricing or something
else (or the wrong type of customer)

experience in talking to and moving between customers and engineers

confidence amid a state of constant change, often operating “without a
map”

the  ability  to  walk  in  their  customers’  shoes,  understanding  how  they
work and the problems they face

Some would say this checklist isn’t bad for identifying great entrepreneurs.

Rule No. 12:

Preserve All Cash Until Needed. Then Spend.

The  goal  of  Customer  Development  is  not  to  avoid  spending  money  but  to
preserve  cash  while  searching  for  the  repeatable  and  scalable  business
model.  Once  found,  then  spend  like  there’s  no  tomorrow.  This  paragraph  is
worth deconstructing:

Preserve  cash:  When  a  startup  has  unlimited  cash  (Internet  bubbles,
frothy venture climate), it can iterate on its mistakes by burning more dollars.
When  money  is  tight,  without  dollars  to  redo  mistakes,  it’s  crucial  to
minimize  waste.  The  Customer  Development  process  preserves  cash  by  not
hiring  any  sales  and  marketing  staff  until  the  founders  turn  hypotheses  into
facts and discover a viable product/market fit.

While searching: Customer Development observes that at the start, the
company  and  its  business  model  are  based  solely  on  hypotheses,  not  facts,
and that the founders need to get out of the building to turn these hypotheses
into customer data. This “get out of the building” approach, combined with
rapid  iteration  and  pivots,  is  central  to  the  model’s  customer  discovery  and
validation steps.

...preserve cash while searching for the repeatable
and scalable business model...

Repeatable:  Startups  may  get  orders  that  stem  from  board  members’
customer relationships, engineering one-offs, or heroic single-shot efforts by
the CEO. These are great, but they aren’t repeatable by a sales organization.
Search  not  for  the  one-off  revenue  hits  but  rather  for  a  pattern  that  can  be
replicated  by  a  sales  organization  selling  off  a  price  list  or  by  customers
regularly visiting the website.

 
Scalable: The goal is not to get one customer but many—and for each
additional customer to add incremental revenue and profit. The test is: Does
the addition of one more salesperson or more marketing dollars bring in more
gross  profit  (or  users  or  clicks)  than  you  invested?  Who  influences  a  sale?
Who recommends a sale? Who is the decision-maker? Who is the economic
buyer?  Where’s  the  budget  for  purchasing  this  type  of  product?  What’s  the
customer acquisition cost? Affirming the repeatable, scalable sales model is
the  customer  validation  step  of  Customer  Development,  its  most  important
phase. Has the team learned how to sell a target customer? Can this happen
before the startup runs out of money?

Search not for the one-off revenue hits but rather
for a pattern...

Business model: A business model answers the basic questions of how
the company makes money. Is this a revenue play, or is it a freemium model
seeking users? Something else? Who’s the customer?

Spend like there’s no tomorrow: The goal of an investor-backed startup
is  not  to  build  a  lifestyle  business.  The  goal  is  to  reach  venture  scale  (10
times the return on investment or more). When management and board agree
that  they’ve  found  a  repeatable  and  scalable  sales  model  (i.e.,  have  a
product/market  fit),  then  invest  the  dollars  to  create  end-user  demand  and
drive those customers into the sales channel.

Rule No. 13:

Communicate and Share Learning

An  integral  part  of  Customer  Development’s  “learning  and  discovery”
philosophy  is  sharing  everything  that’s  learned  outside  the  building  with
employees, co-founders and even investors.

The traditional way to do this is via weekly company meetings to keep
employees  informed  and  board  meetings  to  let  the  investors  understand  the
progress  made  in  the  search  for  the  business  model.  But  technology  in  the
21st-century has taken us to places we never could get to before. We can now

 
communicate  all  we’re  learning  in  near-real  time  to  everyone  who  needs  to
know.

We  strongly  recommend  that  the  founders  keep  and  share  all  their
activities  in  the  customer  discovery  step  via  a  blog,  CRM  or  product
management  tool.  Think  of  it  as  a  narrative  of  the  customer  discovery
process.  It  records  hypotheses  the  startup  started  with,  who  the  team  has
talked to, the questions asked, the tests conducted, what’s been learned, and
questions for advisors or investors. While this may seem burdensome, it takes
less time than having a weekly coffee with an advisory board member. What
results  is  a  communications  tool  allowing  outsiders  to  view  the  company’s
progress up close and to offer suggestions and course corrections.

Rule No. 14:

Customer Development Success Begins With Buy-
In

Customer  Development’s  “learning  and  discovery”  philosophy  can  be
immensely disorienting to a founder, engineer or investor who has spent his
or  her  career  executing  a  plan.  For  Customer  Development  to  succeed,
everyone  on  the  team—from  investor  or  parent  company  to  engineers,
marketeers  and  founders—needs  to  understand  and  agree  that  the  Customer
Development process is different to its core. If the engineering VP is talking
waterfall  development  or  the  board  demands  a  rigid  timetable,  Customer
Development  is  destined  for  disaster.  Everyone  must  accept  the  process,
recognizing that this is a fluid, nonlinear search for a business model that can
sometimes last for years.

The Customer Development process is different to
its core.

Customer Development changes almost every aspect of startup behavior,
performance,  metrics,  and,  as  often  as  not,  success  potential.  It’s  not  just  a
“nice to do” while executing the revenue model in the back of the business
plan.  Customer  Development  reinvents  the  business  model  on  the  fly,

 
iterating  often  and  pivoting  whenever  indicated.  Founders  need  to  have  the
commitment  of  the  team  and  board  before  embarking  on  Customer
Development.  Ensure  that  all  understand  and  agree  that  it’s  iterative,
necessary,  and  worthwhile  and  that  it  changes  the  benchmarks  and  metrics
along the way.

Comments such as “The product is already spec’ed, and we can’t change
the  features  since  development  is  already  underway,”  or  “We  already  have
the  factory  (or  sales  team  or  marketing  materials)  built,”  or  “We  have  to
launch  to  make  the  numbers  in  the  plan,”  are  all  red  flags.  To  succeed  at
Customer  Development,  the  company  must  abandon  the  old  model’s
emphasis on execution of a fantasy business plan. Instead it must commit to a
Customer  Development  process  stressing  learning,  discovery,  failure,  and
iteration in the search for a successful business model. If you’re ready for this
process, this book will tell you how to do it.

Summary: The Customer Development
Process

The  Customer  Development  process  reflects  the  best  practices  of  winning
startups.  It  is  the  only  approach  for  web-based  businesses  where  failure  is
certain  without  constant  customer  feedback  and  product  iteration  as  they
search  for  their  audiences.  Customer  Development’s  fast  cycle  times  and
inherent  cash  conservation  gives  all  entrepreneurs  more  chances  to  pivot,
iterate, and succeed before the bank account runs dry. Describe this model to
entrepreneurs who have taken companies all the way to a lucrative exit and
beyond, and heads nod in recognition.

While each step has its own specific objectives, the process as a whole
has one overarching goal: discovering the repeatable, scalable, and ultimately
profitable business before running out of cash. This transforms the company
from a set of founding hypotheses into a moneymaking endeavor.

Customer Development is damn hard work. You
can’t fake it.

Customer Development is damn hard work. You can’t fake it. You can’t
just do the slides or “do” the process in a weekend. It’s a full-time, full-body-
contact sport. It’s a long-term commitment to changing the way a startup is
built. But it’s also proven to increase the chances of startup success.

An Introduction to Customer Discovery

No startup business plan survives first contact with customers.

—Steve Blank

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

—Lao Tzu

IRIDIUM  WAS  ONE  OF  THE  BIGGEST  STARTUP  gambles  ever  made—a  bold  and
audacious $5.2 billion bet. Founded by Motorola and a global partnership of
18  companies  in  1991,  Iridium  planned  to  build  a  mobile  telephone  system
that would work “anywhere on Earth,” from ships in the middle of the ocean
to  the  jungles  of  Africa  to  remote  mountain  peaks  where  no  cell  towers
existed.

How?  With  an  out-of-this-world  business  plan.  First,  the  company
bought  a  fleet  of  15  rockets  from  Russia,  the  U.S.  and  China.  Next,  it
launched an armada of 72 private satellites into orbit, where they acted like
500-mile-high  cell  towers  providing  phone  coverage  to  any  spot  on  Earth.
Seven  years  after  Iridium’s  founding,  its  satellites  were  in  place.  But  nine
months after the first call was made in 1998, the company was in Chapter 11
bankruptcy.  When  Iridium  crashed  back  to  Earth,  it  ranked  as  one  of  the
largest startup failures on record. What went wrong?

When Iridium was founded in 1991, worldwide cell-phone coverage was
sparse, unreliable and expensive. Cell-phone handsets were the size of lunch
boxes.  Iridium  put  together  a  business  plan  that  made  assumptions  about
customers,  their  problems  and  the  product  needed  to  solve  those  problems.
Other  assumptions  about  sales  channel,  partnerships,  and  revenue  model  all
added  up  to  a  set  of  financial  forecasts  that  Iridium  would  soon  be  printing
money.

One of the largest startup failures on record as they
executed their business plan.

But in the seven-plus years it took Iridium to go from concept to launch,
innovation in mobile- and cell-phone networks moved at blinding speed. By
the  time  Iridium  launched,  there  were  far  fewer  places  on  the  planet  where
cell-phone  service  was  unavailable.  Traditional  cell-phone  companies
provided  coverage  in  the  most  valuable  parts  of  the  world.  Prices  for  cell
service  shrunk  as  fast  as  phone  handsets  did.  In  contrast,  Iridium’s  satellite
phone was bigger than a brick and weighed about as much. Worse, Iridium’s
cell phone couldn’t make calls from cars or buildings, since it required line-
of-sight  “connection”  to  the  satellites.  Instead  of  50  cents  per  minute  for  a
regular cell call, Iridium’s calls cost $7 a minute, plus $3,000 for the handset
itself.

Iridium’s potential market shrunk nearly every day. Instead of a massive
worldwide market of potential users, it had drawn only a small group willing
to  pay  its  prices  and  put  up  with  the  product’s  many  limitations.  But
Iridium’s business model assumptions and plans were firmly fixed as if it was
still 1991. The company spent $5 billion building a business over eight years
without ever focusing on four key questions:

Have we identified a problem a customer wants to see solved?

Does our product solve this customer problem or need?

If so, do we have a viable and profitable business model?

Have we learned enough to go out and sell?

Answering  these  questions  is  the  purpose  of  the  first  step  in  the

customer discovery process. This chapter explains how to go about it.

(Twenty  years  later,  Iridium  emerged  from  bankruptcy.  In  2000,  an
investor group bought $6 billion worth of its assets for $25 million. After a
long climb back, the company celebrated its 500,000th customer in September
2011.)

Customers don’t behave like your business plan.

 
 
The Customer Discovery Philosophy

A startup begins with the vision of its founders: a vision of a new product or
service that solves a customer’s problems or needs and of how it will reach
its many customers. Customer discovery lowers the odds of spending zillions
and  getting  zeros  in  return  as  the  Iridium  team  did.  So  the  No.  1  goal  of
customer discovery amounts to this: turning the founders’ initial hypotheses
about their market and customers into facts.

Get Out of the Building

Facts  exist  only  outside  the  building,  where  customers  live,  so  the  most
important aspect of customer discovery is getting out of the building, in front
of customers. And not for a few days or a week, but repeatedly, over weeks if
not months. This critical task can’t be assigned to junior staffers and must be
driven  by  founders.  Only  after  the  founders  have  performed  this  step  will
they know whether they have a valid vision or just a hallucination.

Sounds  simple,  doesn’t  it?  But  for  anyone  who  has  worked  in
established companies, the customer discovery process is disorienting. All the
rules  about  new-product  management  in  large  companies  are  turned  upside
down. It’s instructive to enumerate all things you are not going to do:

understand the needs and wants of all customers

make  a  list  of  all  the  features  customers  want  before  they  buy  your
product

hand  Product  Development  a  features  list  of  the  sum  of  all  customer
requests

hand Product Development a detailed marketing-requirements document

run focus groups and test customers’ reactions to your product to see if
they will buy

What you are going to do is develop your product for the few, not the
many. Moreover, you’re going to start building your product even before you
know whether you have any customers for it.

On a startups first day, there’s limited—if any—
customer input.

For  an  experienced  marketing  or  product  management  executive,  these
ideas are not only disorienting and counterintuitive but heretical. Why aren’t
the  needs  of  all  potential  customers  important?  What  is  it  about  a  first
product  from  a  new  company  that’s  different  from  follow-on  products  in  a
large  company?  What  is  it  about  a  startup’s  first  customers  that  make  the
rules so different?

Search for the Problem/Solution Fit

The customer discovery process searches for problem/solution fit: “have we
found a problem lots of people want us to solve (or a need they want us to
fill)”  and  “does  our  solution  (a  product,  a  website,  or  an  app)  solve  the
problem in a compelling way?” At its core, the essence of customer discovery
is  to  determine  whether  your  startup’s  value  proposition  matches  the
customer segment it plans to target.

Problem/solution  fit  is  virtually  identical  to  what’s  sometimes  called
“product/ market fit,” as the previous paragraph indicates. As a result, we use
the  terms  somewhat  interchangeably  throughout  the  book.  Do  realize,
however,  that  in  multi-sided  markets,  there  may  be  multiple  value
propositions  and  multiple  customer  segments.  But  problem/solution  fit  is
only  achieved  when  the  revenue  model,  pricing,  and  customer  acquisition
efforts all match up with the customers’ needs.

Develop the Product for the Few, Not the Many

In  existing  companies,  the  goal  of  traditional  product  management  and
marketing  is  to  develop  a  market-requirements  document  (MRD)  for
engineering  that  contains  the  sum  of  all  possible  customer  feature  requests,
prioritized in a collaborative effort among Product Management, Marketing,
Sales,  and  Engineering.  Marketing  or  Product  Management  hosts  focus
groups,  analyzes  sales  data  from  the  field,  and  looks  at  customer  feature
requests  and  complaints.  This  information  leads  to  the  adding  of  requested

 
features  to  the  product  specification,  and  the  engineering  team  builds  them
into the next product release.

While  this  process  is  rational  for  an  established  company  entering  an
existing market, it’s folly for startups. Why? Startups aren’t small versions of
large,  existing  companies  where  there’s  plenty  of  customer  knowledge  and
input.  In  established  companies,  the  MRD  process  ensures  that  engineering
will  build  a  product  that  appeals  to  existing  customers  in  a  known  market,
where customers and their needs are known. On a startup’s first day, there’s
limited—if any—customer input for creating a formal product specification.

In  a  startup,  the  first  product  is  not  designed  to  satisfy  a  mainstream
customer.  No  startup  can  afford  to  build  a  product  with  every  feature  a
mainstream customer needs all at once. The product would take years to get
to market and be obsolete by the time it arrived. Instead, successful startups
solve this conundrum by focusing development and early selling efforts on a
very  small  group  of  early  customers  who  have  bought  into  the  startup’s
vision.  These  visionary  customers  will  give  the  company  the  feedback
necessary to add features to the product over time.

Earlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith
and buy an early product.

Earlyvangelists: The Most Important Customers of
All

Enthusiasts who spread the good news about your product to friends, family
or  co-workers  are  often  called  evangelists.  But  a  new  word  is  needed  to
describe  the  early  adopters—the  visionary  customers—who  buy  unfinished
and untested products, because they want to “first,” whether it’s for the sake
of gaining a competitive edge or winning bragging rights. We call these early
adopters earlyvangelists. Unlike “mainstream” business or consumer-product
customers  who  want  to  buy  a  finished,  completed,  tested  product,
earlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith and buy an early product
from a startup. Every industry has a small subset of visionaries willing to take
a leap of faith on an early product.

 
One  of  the  mistakes  that  startup  founders  make  is  to  give  away  or
heavily discount early alpha/beta products to blue-chip customers. In single-
sided markets (where the user is the payer) earlyvangelists will be happy to
pay for early access to the product. If they won’t, they aren’t earlyvangelists.
Their willingness to pay is a critical part of the customer discovery process.
You’ll use it to test the entire buying process.

Earlyvangelist Characteristics (Figure 4.1)

 In web/mobile apps, where multi-sided markets (separate users and
payers) are often found, earlyvangelists can be users or payers. But even as
nonpaying  users,  these  earlyvangelists  are  willing  or  eager  accelerators  of
your viral growth.

Earlyvangelists are willing or eager accelerators of
your viral growth.

In both physical and web/mobile channels, earlyvangelists display these

common characteristics (see Figure 4.1):

They have a problem or need.

They understand they have a problem.

They’re  actively  searching  for  a  solution  and  have  a  timetable  for
finding it.

The  problem  is  so  painful  that  they’ve  cobbled  together  an  interim
solution.

They’ve committed, or can quickly acquire, budget dollars to purchase.

Think of earlyvangelists’ characteristics along a scale of customer pain.
Earlyvangelist  customers  will  be  found  only  at  the  top  of  the  scale—those
who  have  already  been  looking  for  a  solution,  built  a  home-grown  solution
(whether in a company by building a software solution or at home by taping
together a fork, a light bulb and a vacuum cleaner) and have or can acquire a
budget.  These  people  are  perfect  earlyvangelist  candidates.  They  can  be
relied  on  for  feedback  and  initial  sales;  they’ll  tell  others  about  the  product
and spread the word that the vision is real. Moreover, they can be potential
advisory board candidates.

Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) First

The idea that a startup builds its product for a small group of initial customers

 
rather  than  devising  a  generic  mainstream  spec  is  radical.  What  follows  is
equally revolutionary.

The goal of the MVP is to build the smallest possible
feature set.

On the day the company starts, there is very limited customer input. All
the startup has is a vision of what the problem, product and solution seem to
be. Unfortunately, it’s either a vision or a hallucination. The company doesn’t
know who its initial customers are or what features they’ll want. One option
is to start developing an entire full-featured first release of the product, with
every feature the founders can think of. We now know this results in wasted
engineering effort, time and cash, as customers don’t use, want or need most
of the features developed without their input.

Another path is to put Product Development on hold until the Customer
Development  team  can  find  customers  who  can  provide  adequate  feedback.
The risk here is lost time and no product for customers to provide feedback
against. A third, more productive approach is to develop the core features of
the  product  (incrementally  and  iteratively  with  agile  engineering  methods),
with  the  feature  list  driven  by  the  vision  and  experience  of  the  company’s
founders. This is a minimum viable product.

The  goal  of  customer  discovery  is  to  test  your  understanding  of  the
customer’s problem and see if your proposed solution will prompt him to use
or  buy  the  product  based  on  its  most  important  features  alone.  Most  users
want finished products, but earlyvangelists are the perfect target for the MVP.
Tailor the initial product release to satisfy their needs. If no one thinks your
MVP  solution  is  interesting  or  sufficient,  iterate  or  pivot  until  an  adequate
number say “yes.”

The shift in thinking to an incremental and iterative MVP as opposed to
a  fully  featured  first  product  release  is  important.  Engineers  tend  to  make  a
product  bigger  and  more  perfect.  The  MVP  helps  them  focus  the  most
important and indispensable features. Your goal in having an MVP is not to
gather feature requests to change the product or to make the feature set larger.
Instead, the goal is to put the MVP in front of customers to find out whether
you understood the customer problem well enough to define key elements of
the  solution.  Then  you  iteratively  refine  the  solution.  If,  and  only  if,  no

 
customers  can  be  found  for  the  most  important  features  of  the  MVP,  bring
customers’  additional  feature  requests  to  the  product  development  team.  In
the  Customer  Development  model,  feature  requests  to  an  MVP  are  by
exception and iteration rather than by rule. This eliminates the endless list of
feature  requests  that  often  delay  first  customer  ship  and  drive  product
development teams crazy.

 MVPs for Web/Mobile Are Different

Web/mobile businesses conduct customer discovery differently from those in
the physical channel. They can reach hundreds or thousands more customers
by  combining  online  and  face-to-face  interactions.  They  place  a  greater
emphasis  on  customer  acquisition,  activation,  and  referrals.  Web/mobile
minimum  viable  products  can  be  developed  faster  and  delivered  earlier,
accelerating  the  discovery  process.  When  delivered,  they  can  conduct  more
tests with customers, with more granular customer-response data. This results
in a faster iteration of the problem statement, the proposed solution, and the
MVP itself.

Use the Business Model Canvas as The Customer
Discovery Scorecard

Often  there’s  a  lack  of  a  shared  and  clear  understanding  of  the  business
model throughout the company. This customer discovery step uses Alexander
Osterwalder’s  business  model  canvas  to  diagrammatically  illustrate  how  a
company  intends  to  make  money.  As  shown  in  Figure  4.2  the  canvas
represents any company in nine boxes, depicting the details of a company’s
product,  customers,  channels,  demand  creation,  revenue  models,  partners,
resources,  activities  and  cost  structure.  (We  described  the  business  model
canvas in detail in the Customer Development Manifesto.)

Business Model Canvas (Figure 4.2)

In this phase you’ll develop a one- or two-page brief about each of the

following boxes in the business model canvas:

Market Size: how big the opportunity is

Value Proposition, Part 1: the product/service, its benefits and minimum
viable product

Customer  Segments:  who  the  customer  is  and  what  problems  the
product solves

Channels: how the product will be distributed and sold

Customer Relationships: how demand will be created

Value  Proposition,  Part  2:  market-type  hypothesis  and  competitive  set/
differentiation

Key  Resources:  suppliers,  commodities,  or  other  essential  elements  of
the business

Key Partners: other enterprises essential to success of the business

Revenue Streams: revenue and profit sources and size

When  you  first  draft  your  initial  hypotheses  your  canvas  begins  to  fill

up, looking like Figure 4.3.

Sample Business Model Canvas—Initial Hypotheses (Figure 4.3)

But in addition to using the business model canvas as a static snapshot

of  the  business  at  a  single  moment,  frozen  in  time,  Customer  Development
uses the canvas as a “scorecard” to track progress in searching for a business
model.

Once  a  week  update  the  canvas  to  reflect  any  pivots  or  iterations,

highlighting in red the changes from the last week.

Then  after  you  and  your  team  agree  on  the  changes  to  your  business
model, integrate them into what becomes your new canvas for the week (the
accepted changes in red are then shown in black). During the next week any
new changes are again shown in red. Then the process repeats each week –
new changes showing up in red. Then a new canvas used for the week.

This  method  highlights  the  changes  over  time  for  your  and  the  team’s

reference. Figure 4.4 shows how the canvases will look over time.

Using the Business Model Canvas as a Weekly Scorecard (Figure 4.4)

Had  they  read  this  book,  and  gotten  out  of  the  building,  the  folks  at
Iridium might have saved billions by learning just how small the market for
their  business  had  become.  It  would  have  allowed  them  to  search  for
alternatives and survival.

there’s
To  sum  up  the  customer  discovery  philosophy:  whether 
product/market fit by finding earlyvangelists, understanding their needs, and
verifying  that  the  initial  minimum  viable  product  solves  a  problem  they’ll
eagerly  pay  to  have  solved.  And  if  not,  use  near-continuous  customer
feedback  to  drive  agile,  frequent  changes  in  product  and  business  model
alike.

As  you  complete  the  hypothesis  development,  your  business  model
canvas quickly becomes multi-dimensional. You are really developing three
initial canvases:

Core elements of the business model itself (value proposition, channel,
etc.)

Hypotheses  you  have  for  each  element  of  the  business  model  (such  as
“people  will  want  these  features,  “or  “customers  will  buy  our  product
because...”)

And a layer outlining the key pass/fail tests you will use to get face-to-
face with customers and use their feedback to convert your hypotheses
into facts.

Overview of Customer Discovery

Customer Discovery: Overview of the Process (Figure 4.5)

Customer Discovery has Four Phases

Phase 1 deconstructs the founders’ vision into the nine parts of the business
model  canvas  (product,  customers,  channels,  demand  creation,  revenue
models,  partners,  resources,  activities  and  cost  structure).  Then  your  team
writes  one-page  briefs  about  each  of  the  hypotheses,  including  the  list  of
experiments or tests you’ll need to conduct to prove or disprove each one.

In Phase 2 you conduct experiments to test your “problem” hypotheses. This
helps  you  understand  how  important  the  problem  is  and  how  big  it  can
become. You do so by testing most elements of the business model, including
the value proposition, pricing, channel strategy, and sales process. Your goal
is to turn hypotheses into facts or discard them if they’re wrong, and replace
them with new hypotheses. In the process, you’ll gain a deep understanding
of customers’ business, workflow, organization, and product needs. When all
the facts are in, update your results on the canvas.

 Web-based products and channels often implement much of Phase 2

online in near-real time.

In  Phase  3,  you  test  your  “solution,”  presenting  your  value  proposition
(product,  pricing,  features,  and  other  business  model  components)  and  the
minimum  viable  product  to  customers  and  compare  their  responses  to  the
“pass/fail”  goals  you  developed  earlier. 
  For  a  web-based  product,  the
MVP  is  a  live  site,  a  live  demo,  or  a  feature  or  piece  of  functionality  or
content.  The  goal  is  not  to  sell  the  product,  but  to  validate  how  well  you
understood  the  problem  in  Phase  2  when  you  heard  customers  say,  “Even
these  minimum  features  solve  our  problems,”  or,  “I  need  this  product.”
Ideally, customers ask, “When can I get it?”

  Online,  customers  should  engage  and  interact,  spend  time  on  it  or
with it, appear in droves, come back again and again, and bring their friends.

In  Phase  4  you  stop  and  assess  the  results  of  the  experiments  you’ve
conducted and verify that you have:

a full understanding of customers’ problems, passions, or needs

confirmed the value proposition solves problems, passions or needs

determined that a sizable volume of customers exists for the product

learned what customers will pay for the product

made certain the resulting revenue should deliver a profitable business

With  your  product  features  and  business  model  validated,  decide
whether  you  have  learned  enough  to  go  out  and  try  to  sell  a  select  your
product  to  a  few  visionary  customers,  or  whether  you  need  to  go  back  to
customers to learn some more. If, and only if, you are successful in this step
do you proceed to customer validation.

That’s  customer  discovery  in  a  nutshell.  The  remainder  of  this  section

details each of the phases just described.

Now let’s get started.

Overview of the Customer Validation Process

Introduction to Customer Validation

Along the journey we commonly forget its goal.

—Friedrich Nietzsche

in 

E.PIPHANY’S  FOUNDING  HYPOTHESES  WERE  typically  pretty  straightforward
and  “investable” 
the  mid-1990s,  when  software  companies  were
automating everything from accounts payable to network security, sales force
processes and even wine-cellar inventories. “Why not automate the marketing
department?” asked the founders, meeting in their modest living room. “After
all, most of the tasks like press releases and data sheets and customer letters
are repeatable processes.” Venture capital was raised and the company began
to build its product based on the founders’ vision.

However,  the  company’s  initial  idea  of  who  the  customer  was  and  the
problem  they  wanted  to  solve  was  just  plain  wrong.  The  company’s  later
success was due to the four passionate entrepreneurs’ willingness to listen to
customers and to the three painful pivots driven by customer feedback.

The Browser Breakthrough

During the ’90s, large corporations acquired different software applications to
automate  each  part  of 
their  enterprise—finance,  customer  support,
manufacturing,  and  sales  among  them.  But  the  data  these  applications
collected  were  accessed  via  reporting  tools  from  the  IT  organization.  More
important,  the  data  existed  in  “virtual  silos,”  with  each  functional  system
walled off from the other. The finance system didn’t talk to the sales system,
which didn’t know that the manufacturing system even existed. Queries like
“Compare  the  sales  data  of  green  dresses  versus  blue  ones  with  current
inventory  for  each  by  store,  and  contrast  the  gross  margin  by  region  to
calculate  discounts”  were  virtually  impossible  to  answer  to  because  they

required combining data from three incompatible applications. As a result, it
could often take days or even weeks to get a simple inventory-detail report.

then-radical 

E.piphany’s 

notion  was 

provide  managers
anytime/anywhere drill-downs and analysis in real time, without IT, through
a revolutionary new technology called a web browser. One of the company’s
key hypotheses was that the product should be a great fit for companies with
lots of customers, tons of data on each one, and a recurring need for fast new
data-driven, microsegmented marketing campaigns.

to 

An Epiphany at E.piphany

Early on, E.piphany assembled an advisory board. A key adviser was the VP
of database marketing at Schwab. She was incredibly generous with her time
and  said  the  system  might  work  in  their  application.  She  introduced  the
company  to  five  other  database  marketing  executives,  who  essentially  said,
“If you get a system working at Schwab, we’ll have to buy one as well.” You
couldn’t  get  much  better 
its  first
earlyvangelist and first market.

that.  E.piphany  had  found 

than 

But each time Schwab’s people looked at the system’s technical details,
they  politely  said  our  product  was  missing  a  key  feature  for  database
marketing. It took two meetings before the founders realized they understood
her  problem,  all  right,  but  the  solution—the  underlying  database  schema  of
the software—was missing the most important feature for solving it. It didn’t
include  “householding,”  and  without  this  feature,  she  could  never  buy  the
E.piphany  system.  (Householding,  well-known  among  database  marketers,
recognizes that two or more people at the same physical address live together
and,  in  Schwab’s  case,  often  invest  together.  This  feature  was  crucial  to
direct-marketers  who  didn’t  want  to  send  multiple  or  differing  ads  to  the
same  address.)  And  no  amount  of  sales  and  marketing  hand-waving  was
going to fix the problem.

It  was  a  major  mistake.  Until  this  meeting,  the  founders  hadn’t
understood the customer problem well enough to provide the correct solution.
E.piphany’s  co-founders,  Ben  Wegbreit  and  Steve  Blank,  joined  the
Schwab VP, and her engineering team in a deep technical discussion of what
the software needed to do for Schwab’s business and what was needed. Ben
asked five or 10 questions, everybody nodded and the meeting ended. On the
long ride back to E.piphany’s living-room office, Steve asked, “Ben, how do

we solve Schwab’s problem?”

After  a  moment  of  silence,  he  replied,  “Show  them  page  6  of  our

product spec.”

“What do you mean page 6? Our spec only has five pages!”
Ben looked at Steve and smiled. “Not anymore.”
They had just pivoted the product and refined the minimum feature set.
E.piphany’s  first  order  from  Schwab  came  the  week  after  they  demo’ed
householding.  Other  orders  followed  soon  after.  A  week  later,  the  founders
sat down to figure out what other feature they would toss out to make room
for this one.

E.piphany  would  go  through  two  additional  equally  painful  pivots
before  its  initial  public  offering,  but  that  “householding”  pivot  sold  the
founders on the “power of the pivot” value.

The  meeting  and  car  ride  from  Schwab  to  the  company  headquarters
illustrates the customer validation process every startup needs: a method for
validating the business model with real customers and orders.

Customer  validation  turns  hypotheses  into  facts  about  basic  questions

like:
     •   Do we understand the sales/user acquisition process?

   Is it repeatable?
   Can we prove it’s repeatable? (If our business model is single-sided
commerce, the only acceptable proof is enough full-price orders.)

   Can we get these orders/users with the current product?

     •   Have we tested sales and distribution channels?
     •   Are we confident we can scale orders/users into a profitable business?
     •   Have we correctly positioned the product and the company?

The Customer Validation Philosophy

Customer validation attempts to “test sell” at every stage. It runs a continuing
series  of  quantitative  pass/fail  tests  to  determine  whether  there’s  strong
enough  product/market  fit  to  justify  scaling  sales  and  marketing  spending.
Most  of  your  testing  effort  will  be  asking  people  to  give  you  an  order  or
engage  with  your  app  or  website.  At  this  point,  you’re  testing  the  entire
business model, not its individual components, even as you learn more details
about some, like price or channel.

Just as customer discovery was disorienting for experienced marketers,

          
          
          
the customer validation process turns the world upside down for experienced
salespeople  and,  in  particular,  those  with  sales  responsibility.  All  the  rules
sales executives learned while selling in physical channels at large companies
are not applicable to startups. In fact, they’re positively detrimental. It’s not
all about the launch party!

In  the  customer  validation  step,  you  are  not  going  to  hire  and  staff  a
sales  team.  You  are  not  going  to  execute  to  a  sales  plan  or  “the  sales
strategy.” The reality  is that  you  don’t  know  enough  yet  to  do  any  of  these
things. At the end of customer discovery, you have in hand firm hypotheses
about who will buy, why they will buy, and at what price they will buy. But
until those hypotheses are validated—with customer orders—they’re all little
more than educated guesses, even with the work invested to develop them.

From Business Model Canvas to the Sales Roadmap

In  customer  discovery  you  tested  some  of  the  hypotheses  of  your  business
model:

Value proposition: You affirmed it with a few dozen to a few hundred
people

Customer segments: You have a hypothesis about customer archetypes

Customer  relationships:  You  tested  several  “get,  keep  and  grow”
activities

Channel:  You  understand  your  key  channel  partners,  and  some  have
expressed interest

Revenue model: The company has an idea of how to price its offering

A  sales  roadmap  uses  all  you’ve  learned  from  customer  discovery  to
guide the creation of a sales funnel specifically for your company. It answers:

Who influences a sale? Who recommends a sale?

Who is the decision-maker? Who is the economic buyer? The saboteur?

Where is the budget for purchasing the type of product you’re selling?

How many sales calls are needed to make one sale?

How long does an average sale take from beginning to end?

What is the selling strategy? Is this a solution sale?

If so, what are “key customer problems?”

What’s the profile of optimal visionary buyers, the earlyvangelists every
startup needs?

 Where will the traffic come from? Will it stick?

 Will the product be strong enough to grow virally?

Unless a company has proven answers to these questions, few sales will
happen, and those that do occur will result from heroic single-shot efforts. Of
course, on some level, most sales VPs realize they lack the knowledge they
need to draw a detailed sales roadmap, but most believe they and their newly
hired  sales  team  can  acquire  this  information  while  simultaneously  selling
and closing orders. This is because most executives new to startups confuse
searching for a business model with the execution of a known business model.
A  sales  roadmap  is  part  of  the  search  for  a  business  model.  Only  after  it’s
built can it be executed. Startups can’t learn and discover while they’re busy
executing.  As  we  can  see  from  the  rubble  of  any  number  of  failed  startups,
attempting to execute before you have a sales roadmap in place is pure folly.

Building a Sales Roadmap Versus Building a Sales
Force

Given how critical the validation step is, a CEO’s first instinct is to speed up
the process by spending more on customer acquisition or adding salespeople.
The reality is, this doesn’t speed up the validation phase. In fact, it most often
slows  it  down.  Instead,  you’ll  build  a  roadmap  to  figure  out  how  to  get
repeatable sales (by explicitly testing product/ market fit). Once that’s done,
then build a sales organization.

Developing a sales roadmap is part of the search for
a business model.

     
     
 
In an existing market, customer validation may simply validate that the
sales  VP’s  rolodex  or  contact  list  is  relevant,  and  that  product  performance
metrics the company identified in customer discovery were correct. In a re-
segmented, clone or new market, even a rolodex of infinite size (or tripling
the  AdWords  budget)  won’t  substitute  for  a  proven  business  model  and  a
tested sales roadmap.

For  an  experienced  sales  or  business  development  executive,  these
statements  about  customer  validation  are  heretical.  All  the  actions  in
Customer Development we consider to be mistakes are what traditional sales
professionals  have  been  trained  to  do.  It  seems  counterintuitive  and
disorienting. So let’s look more closely at why the first sales in a startup are
so different from later-stage sales or selling in a large company.

Founders Must Lead the Customer Validation
Team

Founders  who  complete  customer  discovery  often  mistakenly  ease  up  and
delegate  customer  validation  activities  to  Sales,  Business  Development,
Marketing  or  Product  Management.  This  is  a  bad  idea.  Middle  and  junior
managers  aren’t  likely  to  be  good  at  customer  validation,  which  requires
creative  searching,  probing,  and  turning  on  a  dime—not  execution  of  a
repeatable process.

Why must the founders lead? First, founders and only founders call the
shots  on  pivoting.  To  do  so,  they  must  hear  about  flaws  in  the  product  or
business  model  directly  from  the  customers.  Nothing  else  has  the  same
impact.  Anyone  other  than  a  founder  who  learns  of  a  serious  product  or
business-plan flaw faces two challenges: he or she doesn’t have the authority
to  pivot,  and  he  or  she  seldom  has  the  courage  to  report  bad  customer
feedback to the founder.

  In  web/mobile  channels,  where  there’s  much  more  feedback  to
process, the founders still make the call about pivots, but the company needs
to have data junkies, A/B testers, statisticians, and SEO/PPC experts, as well
as  at  least  one  or  two  wildly  creative  online  marketers.  (This  might  be
physically  embodied  in  the  founder  and  one  or  two  amazing  people.)  This
team  will  measure,  assess,  manage  and  improve  the  acquisition,  or  Get
Customers,  funnel.  As  they’re  getting  “out  of  the  building”  digitally,  a

customer development team also leaves physically for face-to-face customer
validation, and for deal-making that drives traffic or referrals.

Validation Proceeds at Different Speeds in Different
Channels

It takes far more time to set up visits in a physical channel with prospects in
cellphone  companies  in  Asia  and  Africa  than  to  get  customer  feedback
electronically  for  a  website.  And  more  customers  can  be  reached  via
web/mobile channels than can ever be met face-to-face.

 Customer validation for web/mobile startups always proceeds faster
with  many  more  iterations  than  it  does  with  physical  channels  and  goods.
Why? It’s all bits that can be changed. Regardless of speed, the fundamental
principles of customer validation are identical across all channels.

Make Early Sales to Earlyvangelists

In  customer  validation  you  will  target  Earlyvangelists  as  your  first  paying
customers. (If you can’t sell to them, it doesn’t get better over time.)

Constrain Spending in Customer Validation

A  typical  failure  scenario  for  startups  is  premature scaling,  when  there  are
more  salespeople  in  the  field  burning  cash  than  are  needed  while  your
business  model  is  still  unproven.  Or  running  expensive  demand-creation
activities before you’re sure who your customers really are. Too often those
sales  people  are  fired  and  their  marketing  programs  killed  when  the  startup
faces a major pivot after scaling too early. Customer validation delays sales-
and-marketing  hiring  and  spending  until  validation  is  nearly  complete.  This
constraint  is  central  to  the  process,  which  assumes  startups  will  fail  and
iterate often. The spending constraint keeps enough cash in the bank to fund
multiple pivots on the road to success.

Prioritize What Needs to be Validated

Prioritizing  the  business  model  elements  that  need  validating  is  essential  at
the  start  of  customer  validation.  Every  startup  business  model  has  a  zillion
moving parts. Validation can’t possibly measure and affirm every variable or
the  founders  will  be  100  years  old  by  the  time  they’re  ready  to  scale—or,
worse, exit—the business.

The business model canvas is an excellent guide here. Most startups will
focus  on  the  four  core  elements:  value  proposition,  customer  relationships,
channel, and revenue model. This list works for many businesses but not all.
Multi-sided markets need to prioritize all sides of the market. Think about the
five or fewer things that will make this a huge, successful business—or not.

Why Accountants Don’t Run Startups

With all the process steps involved, it’s sometimes hard to remember that the
Customer Development process isn’t a giant focus group. The goal is not to
add  up  all  the  customer  feedback  and  vote  on  what  features  to  implement.
Founders who are artists at heart run startups—the true purpose of Customer
Development  is  to  inform their vision.  (In  a  new  market,  there’s  no  data  at
all!)  A  great  entrepreneur  may  consider  all  the  customer  data,  listen  to  his
instincts and say, “Here’s why I’m going to ignore what we just heard.”

 And Finally: Don’t Be Afraid to Let Go When

Lightning Strikes

Occasionally,  fast-scaling  web/mobile  startups  with  viral  or  network-effect
drivers  find  the  business  suddenly  blasting  off,  even  if  this  book  doesn’t
suggest  that  it  should  happen  yet.  This  occurred  at  Google,  YouTube,
Facebook, and Twitter, to name an elite few. If you’re lucky enough to hit a
consumer nerve as hard as they did, put this book down and hold on to the
rocket ship. After all, that’s what entrepreneurs do! (Skim the book another
time on your private jet or yacht or Sunfish.)

The Customer Validation Philosophy, in Summary

Customer  discovery  first  tested  your  hypotheses  about  the  company’s

business model with a relatively tiny group of customers who were asked for
opinions,  not  orders.  Discovery  itself  didn’t  deliver  any  proven,  hard  facts
about who would buy or how scalable the business was.

Customer  validation  goes  to  the  next  step  and  determines  whether  a
product/market fit can be validated by orders or usage. It does so by further
developing the MVP as well as the company’s sales and marketing plans and
materials. Then it gets founders out of the building (physically, virtually, or
both)  to  test  the  MVP  and  every  other  key  business  model  hypotheses,
including  product  features,  pricing,  channel,  and  positioning.  How?  By
asking for orders (or downloads, logons, or clicks)!

Test the MVP. How? By asking for orders.

Customer validation is complete when the company has answers to these

three questions:

1.  Can  the  business  scale?  Will  a  dollar  spent  on  customer  acquisition
yield  more  than  a  dollar’s  worth  of  incremental  revenue,  page  views,
downloads or clicks?

2.  Is  there  a  repeatable  and  scalable  sales  roadmap?  Does  the  company
know the right prospects to call on or acquire, and what to say to them to
consistently deliver sales?

3.  Is the sales funnel predictable? Do the same sales programs and tactics
consistently  deliver  an  adequate,  profitable  flow  of  customers  through
the funnel?

Now let’s get started.

Overview of the Customer Validation Process

 
Customer Validation: Overview of the Process (Figure 5.1)

Customer Validation has Four Phases

Phase  1  consists  of  six  “get  ready  to  sell”  activities;  product  positioning,
sales/  marketing  materials  for  “test  selling”  efforts,  the  hiring  of  a  sales

closer, the creation of a distribution channel plan, refining a sales roadmap,
and  creating  an  advisory  board.  These  activities  make  your  team  the  best
prepared early stage venture ever to hit the streets.

 Companies in web/mobile channels also have six “get ready to sell”
activities:  Product  Positioning,  assembling  Acquire/Activate  Plans,  building
the high-fidelity MVP, building the metrics toolset, hiring a “data chief” and
creating  an  advisory  board.  They  help  deliver  lean,  cost-effective  customer
acquisition programs.

Phase 2 gets founders out of the building to put the product to the ultimate
test:  will  customers  validate  your  business  model  by  buying  your  product?
You’ll attempt to actually sell customers an unfinished and unproven product
without a professional sales organization. Getting feedback is as important as
getting  orders.  Startups  in  the  physical  channel  do  this  with  brochures,
PowerPoints, sales materials and, where possible, product demos or mockups.
Dozens if not hundreds of meetings help refine the product presentation and
channel plans, validate the sales roadmap, prove the predictability of the sales
funnel,  and  validate  that  the  business  model  is  repeatable,  scalable  and
profitable in a real-world test.

 Web/mobile startups “go live” and get out of the building virtually to
see  if  their  plans  and  tools  to  acquire  customers  actually  attract  customers
who activate or buy. Do more than a handful of real customers behave as the
hypotheses  suggest  they  will?  Acquisition  and  activation  activities  are
measured and optimized.

Startups in multi-sided markets (physical or web/mobile) need to get out
of  the  building  to  test  each  side  of  the  market.  Web/Mobile  marketers  first
test users and then validate a different set of hypotheses (value proposition,
segment,  revenue  model,  etc.)  with  the  “payers,”  who  are  marketers  or
advertisers willing to pay to reach people using the site for free.

Phase  3  happens  once  you  have  a  couple  of  orders  under  your  belt  and
enough  customer  information  to  develop  and  refine  your  product  and
company  positioning.  The  positioning  is  tested  in  meetings  with  industry
pundits and analysts and face-to-face with the expanded customer audience.

  Web/mobile  startups  refine  their  “Get”  program  tactics.  Then  they
conduct  initial  product  positioning,  next  they  gather  and  organize  the
customer  behavior  data  collected  in  Phase  2:  customer  responses  to  “Get”

activities and metrics summarizing their initial on-site behavior. They collect
feedback about the MVP itself and the effectiveness of acquisition tools.

Phase  4  stops  all  activity  for  long  enough  to  conduct  a  detailed  pivot-or-
proceed analysis and verify that, regardless of channel, customer validation is
complete and the company knows how to scale. If so, it’s ready to reap the
rewards  for  founders  and  investors  alike.  But  first  there  are  lots  of  tough
questions and hard work to verify.

In  sum,  the  question  is  simple:  “is  this  a  business  worth  doing,”  and
devoting  several  years  of  backbreaking  work?  Will  it  generate  enough
revenue,  growth  and  profits  to  achieve  the  founders’  and  investors’  goals?
And has the team learned enough to make it happen?

Odds  are  overwhelming  that  the  optimum  business  model  won’t  be

found on the first or second try in validation.

The moment customer validation is over is when it’s clear that there are
real  orders,  users,  or  clicks—not  surveys  or  chats.  Customer  validation
confirms that customers will accept the minimum viable product, proves that
the customers exist, figures out how to reach them predictably, and crafts a
scalable plan to engage and sell many more. It’s often called the “epiphany
moment.”

CHAPTER 6

Customer Validation: The Toughest
Question of All: Pivot or Proceed?

THIS  IS  THE  MOST  CRITICAL,  MOST  GUT-WRENCHING  phase  of  customer
validation:  honestly  determining  whether  there’s  a  scalable,  profitable
business  model  ahead.  Is  the  company  ready  to  go  forward  to  the  customer
creation step, when millions of dollars are often spent to fuel rapid customer
growth?  This  step  literally  “calls  the  question”  about  the  company’s  future
directions. It’s time to study all the test results, all the customer learning and
all the insights you’ve had from the facts you’ve gathered. Its time to see if
the company is ready to start spending money to scale, and that the result will
be a great, profitable company.

There are three steps to answering the crucial “pivot or proceed” question:

Assemble and review all key discovery and validation findings

Review  the  business  model  hypotheses  and  their  interactions  with  one
another

Focus on the “metrics that matter” in the financial model

Pivot or Proceed: Assemble Data Findings

By  this  point,  the  team  has  assembled  a  massive  amount  of  hard  data:

industry  research,  customer  segments,  customer  feedback,  marketing
program results, channel and cost input and much more. The data needs to be
verified, with any gaps, discrepancies, or anomalies filled in along the way. A
few examples:

The company needs 10,000 customers in order to be profitable, but the
market isn’t that large

Customer  acquisition  or  channel  costs  are  too  high,  rendering  the
company unprofitable

The  sales  roadmap  is  too  long  and  complex,  making  the  cost  of  sales
way too high

Despite best efforts, referrals just aren’t delivering additional customers

These anomalies are relatively easy to spot when all the data is collected
in  one  room.  They  often  call  for  further  customer,  channel,  or  product
development discussions. At times, they drive a business model pivot.

The best way to “translate” piles of data, is to make
it as visual as possible.

Build a War Room

The  best  way  to  “translate”  piles  of  data,  reports  and  questionnaires  is  to
make  it  as  visual  as  possible.  For  best  results,  lock  the  founding  team  in  a
room for a day or two to walk step by step through each hypothesis. Cover
one wall with a blown up “final” business model canvas. Cover the other wall
with the hypotheses themselves, sorted to keep the pieces of each hypothesis
together (remember, many hypotheses have multiple parts). Use another wall
for  supporting  diagrams,  and  allow  space  for  the  most  recent  canvas  and
perhaps one or two earlier iterations. Leave a large whiteboard available for
keeping score of questions and changes and for the key “metrics that matter”
numbers that emerge (discussed in detail in Step 3). While not every diagram
is appropriate for your startup, review:

 
a  work-flow  map  of  the  prototypical  customer  that  diagrams  how
customers do their jobs or live their lives both with and without the new
product

an  organizational/influence  map  showing  whom  consumers  or
businesspeople interact with, how often, and how those people influence
buying decisions.

customer archetypes: how they earn and spend their money and use their
time

a market map showing where your customers will come from

a channel or sales roadmap diagramming how sales will happen

a  fully  updated  business  model  canvas  (along  with  a  few  earlier
versions)

Review the Data

The most important hard data to review includes:

customer  feedback,  particularly  from  sales  report  cards  evaluating
customer enthusiasm for the product and its potential sales revenue over
time

market size and market share estimates

channel feedback and revenue potential summaries

pricing, customer acquisition costs, and any major product cost changes

detailed  information  about  the  industry,  the  customers,  and  their
behavior

competitive product and pricing information

results of your web “get, keep and grow” tests

details  of  your  customer  acquisition  costs  and  viral  coefficient  and  the
latest  stats  on  page  views  per  visit,  visit  frequency,  user  growth,  and

retention optimization

user-testing  results,  showing  the  rate  of  improvement  for  activation,
conversion, retention and growth activities

The  team,  often  including  investors,  should  review  all  the  materials  to
ensure that all the learning from discovery and validation has been integrated
into  the  latest  versions  of  the  hypothesis  documents  and  into  an  updated
version of the business model canvas that will be discussed in the next step.
The key activity at this stage is to look at the intersections of, or interactions
among,  the  business  model  components,  since  no  doubt  many  components
have  changed  along  the  way.  The  process  is  a  healthy  one,  and  the  results
fuel the next steps of the pivot-or-proceed process.

Look at the intersections of, or interactions among
the business model components.

The  Business  Model  Checklist  (Figure  6.2)  gives  you  and  your
management  team  the  questions  you  should  be  asking  and  worrying  about.
Print  them  out.  Keep  them  handy.  And  worry  “Am  I  going  to  bet  my
company that I got them right?”

Pivot or Proceed: Validate Your Business Model

It’s  been  a  long  road  but  you’ve  converted  most  of  your  business  model
hypotheses from customer discovery into facts. You’ve done so by extensive
testing  through  face-to-face  customer  interactions.  So,  if  the  customer-
relationships  hypothesis  said  one  of  every  five  acquired  customers  will
activate and pay for the service or app, this actually happened in validation,
with  hundreds  if  not  thousands  of  customers.  Or  you’ve  proven  that  people
return to the product or app three times a week for an average of 20 minutes

 
per visit or spend $100 a month visiting once.

Review Business Model Hypotheses (Figure 6.1)

The  team  should  assemble  data  collected  in  the  last  phase  in  its  “war
room” use the checklist to walk through the business model hypotheses, box
by  box,  and  ascertain  that  there  are  factual,  definitive  answers  to  at  least
every question on the checklist.

In  this  final  phase  of  customer  validation  the  company  asks  itself  the
same questions it asked in Phase 4 of customer discovery. But at this point, it
should have much more quantitative, irrefutable proof of the answers, since
you’ve spoken to far more customers and conducted many more tests.

 Web/mobile startups have a unique set of business model hypotheses
that  they  need  to  validate,  particularly  in  the  “Get/Keep/Grow”  Customer
Relationships area. These questions include:

Has the company proven it can acquire and activate a steadily-increasing
number of customers at a cost in line with the cost structure?

Are  the  customers  being  acquired  demonstrating  that  they  will  spend
and “stick” with the company at rates that will deliver the revenue plan?

And  are  customers  referring  other  good  quality  customers  in  sufficient
numbers to deliver these often-free new customers, reducing the average
acquisition cost?

In  multi-sided  markets,  are  customers  visiting  often  enough,
participating actively enough, and staying active long enough to help the
company generate the revenues it needs to succeed?

The Business Model Canvas as a Scorecard

Hopefully  you’ve  been  taking  regular  snapshots  of  your  business  model
canvas  –  either  week-by-week  snapshots,  or  at  least  at  each  major  pivot.  If
you’ve  done  it  this  way  you  now  essentially  have  a  film  strip  of  the
entrepreneurial process.

As you can see from Figure 6.1, each stage of discovery and validation
refined  the  canvas.  Experiments  were  run,  learning  caused  iterations  and  a
few pivots, and all were documented in a new canvas (reread here).

Now that you have your canvases up on the wall use them as a point of

discussion.

The answers to “Is this a business?” can be found in
the results of the multitude of tests you’ve
conducted throughout the validation process.

The  answers  to  “Is  this  a  business?”  can  be  found  in  the  results  of  the
multitude of tests you’ve conducted throughout the validation process. As is
often the case, when the results aren’t convincing enough, or when they don’t
deliver the traffic or financial targets of the business model, it’s time to iterate
or pivot, and retest to see if the new approach improves the results. After all,
the company will very shortly be spending millions of dollars in the customer
creation  phase,  where  results  are  expected  to  be  far  more  predictable,  and
much more is at risk. While this may seem ambitious and unreasonable, the
closer  a  company  is  to  this  “fact-based  plan,”  the  greater  its  chances  for

 
business and fund-raising success.

Business Model Checklist (Figure 6.2)

Pivot or Proceed: Validate the Financial Model

This step answers one key question: do all the tests point to a scalable, sizable
business? And can it happen before the company runs out of money?

In  this  step,  you’ll  figure  out  whether  you  have  a  potentially  thriving

business, a hobby, or a tax loss.

Answering the question doesn’t require pounds of Excel spreadsheets or
50-item budgets. It relies more on the facts you’ve developed by testing your
original  hypotheses  with  the  only  people  who  have  the  answers,  your
customers, and with a short list of numbers, the metrics that matter.

A mere handful of numbers define the difference
between a scalable, profitable business and a
failure.

A  mere  handful  of  numbers  define  the  difference  between  a  scalable,
profitable  business  and  a  failure.  Successful  entrepreneurs  will  be  able  to
recite,  adjust,  and  recompute  this  handful  or  so  of  key  numbers  about
customers, product costs, and revenue growth while they sleep. Meanwhile,
they’re  always  focused  on  the  two  metrics  that  matter  most:  how  many
months’  worth  of  cash  remain  in  the  bank?  And  how  fast  are  we  burning
through what’s left?

We guarantee that this different approach to finance will get you thrown
out  of  just  about  every  business  school  in  the  country,  but  it’s  all  that’s
needed  at  this  stage  to  determine  whether  your  business  model  passes  the
validation test and is ready to move on from validation to scale in customer

 
creation.

Metrics that Matter

Since  page  1  of  this  book  you’ve  been  using  the  business  model  canvas  to
organize  your  testing.  In  this  section  we’re  going  to  use  the  canvas  to
organize  your  financial  model.  This  is  a  radically  different  approach
compared to more typical use of 5-year revenue forecast spreadsheets. Think
of  it  as  bringing  your  “report  card”  home  to  Mom  and  Dad—hopefully,  a
report  card  full  of  A’s  and  A+’s,  since  B  and  C  responses  do  not  a  great
company  make.  Some  elements  of  the  business  model  represent  revenue  or
costs, while others fuel growth. Physical and web/mobile channel costs vary
widely,  as  do  rates  of  sale  and  growth,  so  one  last  time  we’ll  examine  the
metrics three different ways:

In a physical channel, less than a dozen numbers usually tell the entire story:

Value proposition: What are product cost, market size, attainable market
share, and customer impact of network effects?

Customer Relationships: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect
conversion rates, customer lifetime value, and customer switching costs
that the company may have to pay?

Market  Type:  As  discussed  in  Chapter  3,  different  market  types  drive
different revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions

Cost Structure: What are the basic operating costs of the business?

Channel:  What  are  the  costs  of  selling  through  the  channel?  Channel
margin, promotion, shelf-space charges?

Revenue Streams:  What  are  the  average  selling  price,  total  achievable
revenue, and number of customers a year?

Burn Rate  (derived  from  the  above):  How  much  cash  is  the  company
“burning” (spending) a month? When will the company run out of cash?
There’s no precise formula for what a burn rate should be, but since it’s
the issue over which boards most often fire their founders, the founders
and investors must agree on what the burn rate should be and how many

more  pivots  the  startup  can  afford  in  its  search  for  the  scalable,
profitable business model

 In the web/mobile channel, less than a dozen numbers tell the entire

story:

Value proposition: What is the estimated per-user cost of a user, and are
there any incremental costs when one’s added. Estimate the market size,
attainable market share, and the customer impact of referrals or network
effects

Customer Relationships: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect
conversion  and  retention  rates,  and  how  many  new  customers  or  users
will your current customers get you virally, for free?

Market  Type:  As  discussed  in  Chapter  3,  different  market  types  drive
different revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions

Cost Structure: What are the basic operating costs of the business? (Be
sure  not  to  mingle  or  double-count  these  costs  with  your  value
proposition costs)

Channel: What are the costs of selling through the channel: payments to
app stores, marketplace sites like Amazon.com, or related sites referring
customers to you?

Revenue Streams:  What  are  the  average  selling  price,  total  achievable
revenue,  and  number  of  customers  a  year,  and  how  long  or  how  often
will customers spend?

Burn Rate  (derived  from  the  above):  How  much  cash  is  the  company
“burning” (spending) a month? When will the company run out of cash?

A Few Words about Burn Rate

Venture  capitalist  Fred  Wilson  suggests  some  burn-rate  guidelines  for
venture  funded  web/mobile  businesses  that  may  be  helpful  to  entrepreneurs
of  all  stripes.  Wilson’s  advice  looks  at  burn  rate  based  on  the  company’s
growth stage.

Customer discovery, which he calls the “building product” stage, should
keep the burn rate between $50,000 and $75,000 a month, which should
fund a team of three or four engineers building the MVP as well as the
founding team, rent, operating costs and the like

Customer validation, Wilson’s “building usage” stage, shouldn’t exceed
a burn rate of $100,000 a month. This stage begins when product/market
fit  is  achieved  and  fuels  the  “get  customers”  and  MVP  iteration
discussed in this chapter

Customer  creation,  Wilson’s  “building  the  business”  stage,  should
ideally hold the burn rate to $250,000 a month as the company builds a
team,  expands  marketing  activities,  and  starts  generating  material
revenues

These are guidelines, and there are zillions of exceptions.

Assemble all your test results to provide a forecast for the coming year,
which begins on Day One of Step 3 of Customer Development, the customer
creation process.

We  doubt  there  have  been  many  startups  where  the  year-one  financial
results of customer creation matched the “metrics that matter.” But any VC,
uncle or rich neighbor is going to want to know why you think an investment
in your startup will deliver startup-size returns. If at the end of this step the
numbers  are  ugly—yup,  you  guessed  it—turn  back  to  the  beginning  of
discovery,  or  at  least  customer  validation,  and  start  revising  and  retesting
your hypotheses.

Three things to consider before you dive into Metrics That Matter:

Use  the  time  frames  that  make  the  most  sense  for  your  startup.
Generally,  the  longer  the  physical-channel  sales  cycle  (think  enterprise
software), the longer the “space” between calculations should be. Here
we used a quarter-by-quarter forecast

An analysis like this can—and should—often stop the pivot–or-proceed
process in its tracks if the computation forecasts that the company will
either run out of money within the year or won’t be able to raise enough
funds to survive the first year of customer creation

Don’t be in a hurry at this critical step. As an entrepreneur, if you take a
pile of money to move forward here and fail, it will at least cost you a
significant  portion  of  your  founders’  equity,  and  it  will  often  cost  you
your job

Metrics that Matter Scenarios

Metrics  matters  are  a  radically  new  approach  to  startup  math.  They’re  best
illustrated with a series of examples. The three spreadsheet scenarios on the
next pages illustrate how you can use “Metrics that Matter” to evaluate your
business. The three examples are:

a physical product sold in a physical channel

a web/mobile product sold in the web/mobile channel

and a multisided web/mobile market

Metrics that Matter: Example 1

“EZ Gardener” in a Physical Channel

Let’s take a look at Table 6.1 what the metrics that matter for a physical

channel would look like in spreadsheet form.

Here’s  a  simple  example  of  a  rough  quarter-by-quarter  cash-burn
computation  for  our  hypothetical  $30  (suggested  retail)  EZ  Gardener  all-in-
one  gardening-tool  set,  sold  in  garden  stores  and  by  mass  merchants.  Our
timing is the coming year. (The spreadsheet starts Day One of the customer
creation process.)

“Metrics That Matter”: Physical Channel Model (Table 6.1)
Note: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that
follows.

A  few  things  about  the  hypothetical  business  factored  into  the  numbers

above:

This “friends and family” funded venture begins customer creation with
$500,000  in  the  bank.  Like  most  physical-channel  marketers,  EZ
Gardener  also  promotes  online.  But  they  read  this  book,  followed
directions,  and  are  “getting  the  most  important  channel  right  first,”  so
they’re not selling product online yet

In year two, as the product’s newness wears off, the price drops.

Product  development  was  completed  earlier  offshore,  so  there  are  no
more development costs until we see how this product sells

Revenue  never  scales  dramatically,  since  the  market  type  is  “re-
segmenting/niche market”

What Metrics Matter?

There are 11 metrics that matter in this spreadsheet. Following the left-hand
column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of each number as well as
its source a little more closely:

1.   Total number of units sold: This number is estimated (ideally by

quarter) from customer validation report cards used with buyers and
channel partners. Compare these numbers with your estimates of total
addressable (or if known, serviceable) market and your market share
estimates. Use the two sets of numbers to estimate the number of units to
be sold in each quarter. If customers make multiple purchases within a
year, factor it in.

2.   Average retail selling price: How much the consumer will pay, on

average, for the product. This number, developed in the value proposition
hypothesis, should be validated in the competitive analysis and
throughout customer and channel validation conversations. It’s shown
here as the price per unit and is often the average selling price, since retail
pricing may vary by channel.

3.   Gross sales across all channels: Total retail-dollar sales for the product
per quarter. Relatively straightforward to compute, since the company is

using only one sales channel. Remember to consider “guaranteed sale”
situations where retailers can return unsold merchandise for full credit.

4.   (Less) channel discount (40%): What percentage of the product’s retail
price will the channel take as its cost of sales? Deduct it from the retail
price and apply it to all channel revenue as computed in No. 3. We’ve
assumed a fairly typical chain-store margin here. This revenue will never
reach the company’s coffers, so deduct it now to get to net company
revenue.

Channels are notorious for charging suppliers for
advertising, promotion, and shelf space.

5.   (Less) other channel costs: Channels are notorious for charging

suppliers for advertising, promotion, and even shelf space. There may
also be costs of independent sales reps or brokers who “sell in”
merchandise to the channel. In the first year, the company may want to,
or be forced to, purchase special promotions in order to get shelf space in
an important retail channel. Estimate these costs based on channel-partner
discussions.

6.   NET COMPANY REVENUE: The net channel revenue (No. 6) is the

Gross Sales (No. 3) minus the channel discount (No. 4) and other channel
cost (No.5).

7.   (Less) sales costs (reps, trade shows): How much does it cost the team

to reach the garden product channel cost? In addition to specific customer
acquisition costs, the company will spend money on a sales force, sales
and marketing materials, attendance at trade shows and more. These costs
should be identified in the customer-relationships box and perhaps also in
the cost structure box.

8.   (Less) product costs: What does it cost to build and make the product?

Developed primarily from the value proposition and cost structure boxes,
this is an estimate combining two sets of costs:

 
     •   in this example the cost of developing the product is fully paid for

     •   the manufacturing cost of the physical product itself

9.   (Less) current operating costs: Compute the costs of “turning on the
lights” at the company every day, which should be a relatively static
number: meager founder salaries, other payroll, rent, equipment, utilities,
legal, and the like. This number usually shifts the least, so worry about it
less than others. The spreadsheet increases it modestly late in the year and
in the second year, as is typical.

10.  CASH BURN FOR PERIOD: Did we make or lose money this quarter?
How much? Start with the net company revenue (No. 6) and subtract all
the costs beneath it, Nos. 7, 8, and 9. The result of that equation is the
“cash burn,” or the reduction in the company’s bank account each quarter.
In the example above, the company is losing money, or “burning cash,”
until the fourth quarter, when customer growth and reduced product-
development costs improve the company’s cash flow quite dramatically.

11.  CASH REMAINING: Start by counting the money in the bank on Day
One of the quarter. Our hypothetical company began its first year of
customer creation with $500,000 in the bank. Reduce it by the quarter’s
cash burn to determine how much will be left at quarter’s end.

If These Were Your Numbers, What’s a Founder to
Do?

This is a “nice little business,” and while it will make a lovely living for its
founders and a nice return for its investors, it’s hardly a scalable business like
the many heroes of Silicon Valley. But even though this company is returning
as much pretax profit in year two as it had in the bank on day one of year one,
it’s  basically  going  nowhere  fast.  It’s  a  one-product  company,  and  the  only
way  it  got  strong  revenue  growth  was  by  reducing  its  retail  price—never  a
good sign.

Some things the founders and board should really be discussing:

Are there any potential dramatic changes to the business model that can
have significant impact on the company’s future growth prospects?

What about overseas markets? Are they a growth opportunity?

How  can  the  company  capitalize  on  its  one  modest  success.  Are  they
building a brand enough, and creative enough, to perhaps launch other
products  both  in  and  beyond  the  garden  area.  They  might  start  with
“EZWeeder”  and  “EZhoe”  first,  and  perhaps  expand  to  “EZgrass”  or
“EZflowers” to take maximum advantage of their brand, credibility and
channel relationships to scale the company broader and faster?

Can  they  extend  beyond  the  garden,  maybe  adding  “EZcooker”  or
“EZcleaner” or “EZcleanup” perhaps? Regardless of the new products,
the  company  would  need  to  spend  some  serious  product  development
dollars and spend heavily on marketing (especially if moving beyond the
garden)  with  no  assurances  of  further  success.  (They  actually  need  to
develop a whole new set of hypotheses)

Unless the company invests in new product development, this business
is more of a hobby than a scalable business

Hold these thoughts—and others—for the final section of this phase, the
pivot-or-proceed  discussion.  Next,  look  at  the  second  of  three  business
models for a software product sold in the web and mobile channels.

Metrics that Matter: Example 2

Expense Reporter Sold via Web/mobile Channels

 Let’s take a look at Table 6.2, another $30 retail product, downloadable

XpensePro software, sold through the web/mobile channels only.

“Metrics That Matter”: Web/Mobile Sales Model (Table 6.2)
Note: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that
follows.

In this scenario, our hypothetical company is selling XpensePro only as
a web or mobile app download directly from its website and via app stores.
As in the previous example, things are factored into the numbers above:

Product-development cost is heavy at first and then declines.

Incremental product unit costs are practically zero, since the product is a
download

Revenue  never  scales  dramatically,  since  the  market  type  is  “re-
segmenting/niche  market,”  but  the  year-to-year  revenue  increases  are
significant enough to promise downstream success

This  angel-funded  business  starts  with  $300,000  cash  remaining.  More
money will be hard to get

What Metrics Matter?

There are five metrics that matter in this spreadsheet:
     •   Revenue comes from three channels

   Direct revenue from web sales, net of acquisition cost
   Direct mobile sales revenues, after subtracting referral incentives
   Revenue from the appstore channel, after subtracting channel fees

and marketing costs

     •   Cash burned or made during the period
     •   Cash remaining at the end of the quarter

Because  the  business  is  operating  in  three  distinct  channels,  each  of
which operates differently, it takes 17 different numbers to create the above
five metrics, but the board just needs to focus on five rather than 17. If one’s
ever out of whack or way off budget, drill down into the supporting details
numbers  that  make  that  number  up:  unit  sales,  gross  direct  revenue,  cost  of
customers or sales, and net revenue from the channel.

          
          
          
Following the left-hand column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of
each number and its source:

Web Sales:

1.      Direct  web  unit  sales:  How  many  web  apps  are  downloaded  from  the
company’s  site.  Customers  are  unlikely  to  make  multiple  purchases
within a year.

2.      Gross  direct  revenue:  Multiply  the  number  of  units  (No.  1)  by  the

average selling price of $30.

3.   (Less) customer acquisition cost: The cost to make a sale over the web
On  average,  $6  worth  of  AdWords,  incentives,  e-mail  and  the  like  to
acquire one customer. Multiply $6 by the number of solid units (No. 1).

4.      Net  web  revenue  total:  Subtract  the  customer  acquisition  cost  (No.  3)

from the gross direct revenue from website sales (No. 2).

5.   Direct mobile unit sales: A few customers will find and download the
app’s mobile version at the company website (most will find it at the app
stores).  Calculate  the  quarterly  units  using  the  process  described  in  EZ
Gardner metric #1.

On the surface, this looks like a really lovely
business.

6.   Gross revenue/direct mobile units: Multiply the number of mobile units

sold directly to customers (No. 5) by $30, the average selling price.

7.      (Less)  referral  incentive:  The  customer-relationships  hypothesis
indicates  that  a  third  of  the  company’s  direct  sales  will  come  from
referrals by happy customers encouraged by a $4 incentive. Take 1/3 of
the directsales web (No. 1) and mobile (No. 5) units and multiply by $4.

8.      DIRECT  mobile  revenue  total:  How  much  cash  winds  up  in  the

 
this  channel?  Multiply  units  (No.  5)  by
company’s  bank  from 
revenue/unit  (No.  6)  and  then  subtract  the  referral  incentive  (No.  7)  to
find the answer.

9.      CHANNEL  app-store  sales  (units):  Calculate  units  using  the  channel

method outlined in EZ Gardner unit sales #3.

10.  CHANNEL gross revenue: multiply the channel units sold (No. 9) by

the retail price of $30.

11.    (Less)  market/app-store  30%  fee:  Every  download  sold  will  cost  the
company an app store fee of 30 percent, or $9. Multiply units (No. 9) by
$9.00 and subtract it from channel revenue (No. 10).

12.    TOTAL  NET  APPSTORE  revenue:  Subtract  the  app-store  fee  (No.
11)  from  channel  revenue  (No.  10)  to  find  the  amount  of  cash  that  will
wind up in the company’s bank from app-store sales.

13.    TOTAL  NET  revenue  (all  channels):  Add  three  revenue  numbers—
No.  4  (direct  web  revenue),  No.  8  (direct  mobile  revenue),  and  No.  12
(net channel revenue)—to compute the company’s net sales.

14.  (Less) product/product-development costs: What does it cost to build
and  make  the  product?  Compute  your  ongoing  product  development
costs, plus download and bandwidth charges. There’s no physical cost of
the product itself.

15.    (Less)  current  operating  costs:  Compute  the  costs  of  turning  on  the

lights at the company every day, as in Example 1, line 9.

16.  CASH BURN FOR PERIOD: Did we make or lose money this quarter?
How  much?  Follow  the  process  for  calculating  cash  burn  outlined  in
Spreadsheet 1, line 10.

17.  CASH REMAINING: Follow the process in Spreadsheet 1, No. 11.

If These Were Your Numbers, What’s a Founder to
Do?

On  the  surface,  this  looks  like  a  really  lovely  business.  It  plans  to  generate
$746,000  in  positive  cash  flow  in  its  first  year  of  customer  creation,  and  to
roughly triple that cashflow in its second year. But can a business doing $2.5-
million in revenue after four years really make investors and founders happy?
That’s not for us to decide, and the numbers don’t tell us whether they spent
$500,000 and a year—or $5,000,000 and five years—to get to the start of the
spreadsheet, so it’s hard to applaud or bash the outcome.

Seems  like  the  next  board  meeting  should  pull  out  the  latest  business
model canvas and look for some game-changing growth opportunities, almost
no matter what. The company isn’t spending all that much money on product
development or staff costs (those numbers are relatively flat), and it’s almost
turning into a cash cow long before it should be turned out to pasture.

After  all,  almost  any  business  that  can  get  almost  100,000  new
customers in a year should be trying to figure out how to either add a zero to
that number in a year or two, or at least double it, perhaps, in the second year.
The company’s year two plan seems unambitious at first glance, even though
the profits double.

Meanwhile, on the downside:

The  $4  incentive  (No.  7)  might  deliver  too  few  sales  and  need  to  be
beefed up, changing net revenues adversely

App-store  (No.12)  approval  process  could  delay  launch  in  the  biggest
channel, hurting revenues

More  staff  (No.  15)  might  be  needed  for  support,  channel  relations,  or
who-knows-what

Mobile  sales  direct  to  consumers  (No.  5)  could  be  a  total  flop,  hurting
that revenue

Even though the numbers look pretty good in the spreadsheet, hold the
high-fives and look at ways to improve them anyway. After all, they’re still
estimates based on customer validation proof—they’re not money in the bank
by  any  means.  Review  the  “what’s  a  founder  to  do”  section  under
Spreadsheet 1 to explore ways to reduce the cash burn where it makes sense.
Hold all these thoughts—and others—for the final section of this phase, the

pivot-or-proceed discussion.

“Metrics That Matter”: Multi-sided/Ad-Supported Model (Table 6.3)
Note: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that
follows.

Metrics that Matter: Example 3

A Multi-sided Market Example

Here’s a third way to look at a totally different business model for the exact
same  product,  XPensePro  software.  Let’s  explore  a  multi-sided  market,
where  the  product  is  identical  but  it’s  absolutely  free  to  users.  Advertisers
eager to reach businesspeople with active expense accounts will pay to reach
the  audience,  and  company  revenues  come  from  advertising  and  sales  of  e-
mail lists, the other “side” in this multi-sided market example.

A multi-sided market, where the product is
identical but it’s absolutely free to users.

In  this  scenario,  our  venture-backed  multi-sided  market  company  is
offering its products to users for free, provided that they agree to receive two
e-mails  per  week  from  advertisers.  The  product  is  a  digital  download,  but
considerable  resources  are  expended  selling  ads  to  the  other  side  of  the
market. (It’s interesting to note how dissimilar these metrics that matter are
when  compared  with  the  other  two  business  models.)  As  in  the  previous
example, several things are factored into the numbers above:

Our VC-backed example has a $10-million war chest

Product-development cost is heavy at first and then declines

Product costs are practically zero, since the “product” is a download.

Revenue  never  scales  dramatically,  since  the  market  type  is  “re-
segmenting/niche  market,”  but  the  year-to-year  revenue  increases  are
significant enough to promise downstream success

Much  of  the  cost  of  advertising  and  e-mail  sales  is  factored  into  the
revenue numbers, which are net of network or rep commission costs

 
It still costs real money to acquire users through PR, e-mail, and other
activities, even for a free product. As the company iterates and becomes
smarter, its acquisition cost declines in the second year

Metrics that Matter/Add It All Up

There  are  16  “metrics  that  matter”  in  this  spreadsheet  because  we  need  to
monitor  revenue  and  costs  on  both  sides  of  the  multi-sided  market.  (The
company  pivoted  and  eliminated  cash  sales  of  its  product  in  this  scenario.)
Following the left-hand column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of
each number as well as its source a little more closely:

1.   New activated users : How many people will download the free app and
begin actively using it. Active is defined as generating at least the average
number of page views (No. 4).

2.   New user acquisition cost @ $3: On average, the customer acquisition
costs to generate one active user (No. 1). Some will come virally for free,
others will cost $6 or more.

3.   Total active users: Average active monthly users during the quarter.

4.   Average page views per user per quarter: Actual user clicks on the site
will generate this number by dividing the number of active users (No. 3)
into  total  page  views  (No.  5).  This  is  an  important  measure  of  the
business health and growth.

5.      Total  page  views  per  quarter:  Multiply  the  total  users  (No.  3)  by  the
average  page  views  per  user  (No.  4)  to  begin  to  understand  available
advertising-sales opportunities for the period.

6.      Less  attrition:  Lots  of  users  abandon  things  they  download  but  don’t
have to pay for, so watching this number (generated by instrumentation)
is  important.  We’ve  defined  attrition  as  a  user  who  hasn’t  generated  a
page view a week for two consecutive months.

7.   TOTAL CPMs to sell: subtract attrition (No. 6) from total page views
(No. 5) and divide by 1,000 for the “salable CPMs” needed (ad sales are
based on cost per thousand, or CPM). The +/- 7% average gets worse in
year two as more competitors emerge.

8.      Average  CPM  x  4  ads/page:  Competitive  analysis  and  “buy-side”
customer  validation  research  will  determine  what  CPM  advertisers  are
willing  to  pay  to  reach  this  audience.  Assuming  four  ads  on  each  page,
multiply the average CPM by 4 to compute the average revenue per 1,000
pages viewed. In this example, we’ve already deducted the cost of sales,
whether  it’s  commissions  for  sales  reps  or  network  ad  sales.  The  CPM
increases (Q3-4) as the site gets more attractive to advertisers.

9.   TOTAL ADVERTISING REVENUE: multiply the number of M’s (No.
7)  or  total  CPMs  available  for  sale  by  the  4x  average  CPM  (No.  8)  to
compute  advertising  revenue.  The  figure  grows  dramatically  as  the
number of users and their site traffic rise.

The business model looks so strong and
compelling...

10.  E-mail-list rental revenue: An estimate based on competitive analysis
and  buy-side  customer  validation  research.  This  starts  out  small  and  at
very  low  rates  (per  thousand)  and,  both  CPM  and  volume  build  as  the
audience becomes large enough to be attractive to advertisers.

11.  TOTAL REVENUE: This ad-supported multi-sided marketer has only
two  sources  of  revenue.  Add  the  advertising  revenue  (No.  9)  to  the  e-
mail-list rental revenue (No. 10).

12.  (Less) user acquisition cost: Subtract the number from Line 2 here.

13.    (Less)  product/product-development  cost:  Computed  from  customer
validation  and  cost  structure  boxes  of  the  business  model.  While  this
declines  later  in  the  first  year  as  the  initial  product  matures,  the  budget
increases  in  the  second  year  to  add  features  that  will  help  the  company
continue attracting new customers.

14.    (Less)  current  operating  costs:  Compute  the  costs  of  turning  on  the
lights  at  the  company  every  day,  as  the  EZ  Gardner  example,  line  9  on
page 442.

15.  CASH BURN per period: Subtract the three cost centers (Nos. 12, 13
and  14)  from  the  total  revenue  (No.  11)  to  compute  the  quarterly  cash

 
burn.

16.  Cash remaining/end of quarter: Subtract the cash burned (or collected)
during the quarter from the checkbook balance as of the first day of the
quarter  to  calculate  the  cash  remaining  at  quarter’s  end.  This  number
becomes attractive rather quickly in this model.

If These Were Your Numbers, What’s a founder to
do?

There’s an old rule in startups that a spreadsheet is worth 48.5x the paper it’s
printed  on.  But  if  this  spreadsheet  set  of  “metrics  that  matter,”  is  anywhere
close to accurate, our founders and investors at Expensereporter may indeed
have a homerun on their hands.

In this case, the business model looks so strong and compelling that the
founders have two clear priorities. Job #1 is to play strong defense, and make
certain  that  they  deliver  on  all  the  key  numbers  in  the  plan  (which,  as  you
recall, are already turned into immutable facts through two grueling stages of
Customer Development). That process starts with a step-by-step revalidation
of  every  single  number  on  the  page,  to  be  sure  there  are  no  mistakes.  Next
step: a detailed “worst case” analysis.

As  every  business  should,  the  founding  team  here  should  expand  this
one set of metrics into three: a worst case and a high case, on both sides of
the hypothetical set of metrics shown here. And since the business is totally
dependent on advertising revenue, they should quickly return to their channel
validation efforts and probe further to make sure they’re as valid as everyone
believes. They should also focus on reducing user attrition.

With all that accomplished, review the analyses from Spreadsheets 1 and
2 about reducing costs and optimizing activation and revenue. Then, just in
case, put a case of great French Champagne in the office fridge!

Some Final Thoughts About the Financial Model

Market Type Affects Revenue Streams. Each of the four market types has a
distinctive sales-growth curve shaped by the degree of difficulty involved in
transitioning  from  sales  to  the  earlyvangelists  to  sales  to  mainstream

customers. Obviously in new markets, it typically takes considerable time for
the  product  to  catch  on  beyond  earlyvangelists,  who  aren’t  typically  high-
volume mainstream buyers. So success with early sales doesn’t guarantee fast
revenue scaling.

The  sales-growth  curves  for  a  new  market  and  an  existing  market
graphically  illustrate  the  difference.  Even  after  finding  and  successfully
selling to earlyvangelists, the rate of sales differs in later years because of the
different adoption rates of mainstream customers.

Revenue Growth in New and Existing Markets (Figure 6.3)

Estimating  revenue  in  an  existing  market  is  relatively  simple:  Look  at
the  incumbents  and  calculate  the  increasing  percentage  of  market  share  the
startup will grab each year.

Estimating a new market’s size might seem impossible, since it doesn’t
exist yet. What to do? Estimate the opportunity based on proxies and adjacent
markets.  See  if  there  are  any  comparable  companies.  Have  others  grown  as
fast as the estimate? Why will this startup perform similarly?

Revenue Growth in a Resegmented Market (Figure 6.4)

The  sales  curve  in  a  re-segmented  market  is  somewhat  easier  to
estimate. It’s generally similar to that of a new market in that it takes time to
gather  a  head  of  steam.  There  are  three  steps  to  assessing  a  re-segmented
market:  assess  the  size  of  the  existing  market,  figure  out  how  large  your
startup’s “segment” is, and calculate the adoption rate, or the time it will take
for  that  segment  to  recognize  the  new  product  as  the  solution  of  choice.
Count only the segment that will switch, and beware of long-term contracts,
service  contracts,  and  “sunk  costs”  such  as  training  and  installation,  all  of
which are often “lock-ins” or hidden barriers to switching.

Revenue growth curves depend on Market Type!

Demand Curve Affects Revenue: The “demand curve” seeks the optimum
intersection between sales volume and net profit. For example, if a physical
product  is  most  efficiently  manufactured  in  lot  sizes  of  5,000,  can  that
inventory  be  sold  in  a  reasonable  time  when  current  unit  sales  are  50  a
month? A startup selling new electric cars for $29,000 will generate massive
demand.  But  if  they  cost  $45,000  to  manufacture,  the  company  will  go
bankrupt very quickly. Consider:

the actual price per unit, for multiples, and for subscriptions

how pricing can be used to attract more users

how  pricing  can  create  larger  or  more  frequent  purchases  by  the  same
user; volume discounts, free shipping, loyalty points and similar pricing

 
mechanisms  are  used  for  what’s  typically  called  “market  basket”
optimization

how pricing can be used to enhance profitability or volume

how  the  company  can  forward-price  the  product  to  intersect  the
economies-of-scale curve (as in, “If we could build 10,000 at a time, our
production cost drops 32 percent”)

When to Bring in the Accountants

Eventually,  prospective  investors,  banks,  and  others  will  want  to  see  the
traditional  P&L,  forecast,  and  more,  and  that’s  fine.  Once  the  metrics  that
matter are firmly understood to make sound business sense and are validated,
almost any finance type (or high school math student) can convert them into a
VC-ready multiyear P&L spreadsheet, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement
(the “usual stuff” everyone is accustomed to seeing) with ease.

On  rare  and  welcome  occasions,  metrics  that  matter  actually  don’t
matter  at  all.  If  customer  acquisition  and  activation  are  proceeding  at  warp
speed month after month or the economy is hot, investors may ignore most of
the other metrics, throw caution to the wind, and vote to scale the company
rapidly. This seldom happens, but we hope it happens to you. It can happen
more often in frothy vertical markets, as it did in social networking and other
multi-sided  markets  or  strong  IPO  markets,.  But  nine  times  out  of  10,  the
metrics that matter do matter quite a bit when it comes time to spend serious
investor dollars.

Adding it all up

This phase is a vital make-or-break analysis of how well the business model
should work. But remember that the numbers are still only educated guesses,
validated—we  hope—through  extensive  customer  discovery  and  validation
effort with scores if not hundreds of customers.

Pivot or Proceed: Re-Validate the Business Model

It’s  the  perfect  time  to  take  one  last  look  at  the  key  business  model
components, for several reasons. In a few days, a great deal will change if the
vote  is  “go  forward”  to  the  customer  creation  step.  Customer  creation  is  a
radically  different  stage  during  which  the  company  suddenly  shifts  from
“searching  for  a  business  model”  to  “executing  one.”  It’s  no  longer
celebrating  mistakes  and  wrong  turns.  It  shifts  full-throttle  into  “execute”
mode, with revenue targets and timetables to hit, product and plans to deliver,
and  more  granular  and  precise  accountability  to  investors  and  board
members.

The  company  is  about  to  spend  a  great  deal  of  money  far  faster,  and
irrevocably,  as  it  works  ambitiously  to  deliver  its  chosen  business  model.
With that comes the typical “career risk” for founders, which always prompts
investors to ask if the seemingly manic “founder type” should be replaced by
a “seasoned” leader with proven execution skills. Massive amounts of money
are  about  to  be  spent  on  a  single,  focused  bet  that  the  business  model,  as
developed, has a high likelihood of scaling to profit and success. Boards and
investors  are  suddenly  less  forgiving  and  typically  far  less  welcoming  of
reports like “That idea was wrong” and “That didn’t work as we hoped” than
they were during the earlier “search” phases.

Long  story  short,  it’s  time  to  revisit  the  core  business  model  elements

one last time.

Best Bets

You’re almost done. You’ve run the numbers in the last section and are still
feeling  like  your  business  is  a  winner.  But  have  you  picked  the  best  value
proposition?  Is  your  product  delivery  schedule  right?  Are  you  confident
you’ve gotten the optimum revenue model and costs? And have you missed
any best moves on the overall business model? Here are a few last things to
check.

Make Sure the Value Proposition is Right

After  going  through  the  “metrics  that  matter”  in  the  last  section,  are  you
absolutely convinced you have the right value proposition? You’re about to
live with it for awhile. If you don’t feel that it’s going to win the marketplace
now, it doesn’t get better over time. It may be time to reconfigure, repackage
or  unbundle  the  product.  This  requires  a  loop  all  the  way  back  to  customer
discovery.  Once  there,  use  the  core  technology  to  develop  another  product,
configuration,  distribution  method  or  price  and  then  modify  product
presentations  and  return  to  Phase  3  (product  presentation)  and  do  it  again.
Yes, it hurts, but it hurts far less than failure.

Make Sure the Product Delivery is Right

Even  with  selling  success,  check  the  product  delivery  timing  with  the
product-development  team.  Schedules  inevitably  change,  seldom  for  the
better.  Can  the  company  still  deliver  what  was  just  sold  and  do  so  as
promised,  or  was  the  sale  actually  vaporware?  If  vaporware,  at  best  the
company  secured  a  few  pilot  projects.  Continuing  to  sell  as  if  nothing  has
changed  is  a  bad  idea.  As  schedules  slip,  hard-won  earlyvangelists  weaken,
and  references  evaporate  quickly.  The  good  news  is,  if  this  happens  (it
happens often), the situation is still recoverable. There aren’t many people to
fire, and the burn rate is low. (As discussed earlier, it’s always important to
have  enough  cash  to  get  this  phase  wrong  at  least  once.)  The  solution  is  to
shut down any additional selling for a while, admit mistakes, and turn pilot
projects  into  something  useful—first  for  the  customer  and  then  as  a
marketable product.

Make Sure the Revenue is High and Costs are Low

There’s  nothing  worse  than  leaving  money  on  the  table  or  spending  more
than you needed to. The best way to answer these questions and more is to
“walk” slowly through the business model one more time.

Start  with  the  value  proposition.  Are  there  too  many  features  or  not

enough variety? Would a lower price sell far more units or sell the same
number  at  a  lower  acquisition  cost?  What  if  the  product  were  free,  or
free to those bringing three or five or 10 other customers along?

In the customer-relationships hypothesis, is there rock-solid confidence
in  the  plan,  or  might  a  freemium  or  multi-sided  alternative  deliver
bolder,  faster  growth?  Will  that  costly  AdWords  effort  deliver  the
planned result?

Can a different channel deliver fewer sales and more profit?

Will partners deliver the revenue growth you need and expect?

Are there higher level business model patterns you may have missed?

Make Sure Your Business Model is Right

Grab  a  fresh  business  model  canvas  and  a  pack  of  Post-it  notes.  Explore
alternatives seriously. The team is about to put a big pile of chips, probably
millions, on “red” or “black,” as in “pass” or “fail.” Is everyone confident the
choice is the right?

Changing direction at this juncture is a bold move indeed. It’s not what
the investors expected, especially after a long, grueling process of customer
discovery  and  validation.  Then  again,  bold  moves  are  the  work  of  great
entrepreneurs. And even though a pivot at this point leads to more customer
validation and more time, it’s far better to pivot now than to forge ahead at
full  speed  and  full  spend  if  it’s  possible  that  there’s  a  better  idea  out  there
somewhere.

Further validate the business model, not just looking for enhancements
in  revenue  opportunity  and  places  to  reduce  cost,  but  looking  for  “game
changers.”  Can  you  change  a  product  sold  by  features  into  a  branded-
experience  that  becomes  a  “got-to-have-it”  fashion?  Can  you  change  a
revenue  model  from  a  unit  sale  into  a  network  effects  model?  Look  for  the
non-obvious business patterns. Even if the team is certain the current model
is the best way forward, now’s the time to bring in your advisory board and
have them throw stones (painful as it is) at your canvas. Do they see a huge
move that you missed? No doubt the financial model review just completed
raised  at  least  a  handful  of  questions  and  perhaps  pointed  to  some
opportunities. Revisit the business model checklist questions. Are any of the

answers  different?  Does  the  team  want  to  have  more  money  in  the  bank  or
spend less? Where can savings be effected or additional dollars efficiently put
to good?

If the team has turned over every possibility in its review, looking both
at  radical  changes  and  modest  improvements  in  the  business  model,  and
confidence still carries the day, it’s time to move on to the ultimate question:
pivot or proceed?

The Toughest Startup Question: Pivot or Proceed?

This  is  the  moment  of  truth  when  the  team  and  the  investors  will  vote  on
whether to begin spending massive amounts of money to execute the business
model.  To  vote  honestly,  the  team  needs  to  take  a  hard,  honest  look  at  the
pivot-or-proceed analyses developed in this phase.

As  grueling  as  the  customer  validation  process  is,  it’s  quite  likely  that
the  company  will  require  another  turn  of  the  wheel  before  everyone  can
enthusiastically  vote  to  move  forward.  Don’t  despair—this  need  to  pivot
arises almost every time, and often calls for a return all the way to customer
discovery.

Hubris is the evil twin of a passionate entrepreneur.

The  alternative  is  even  more  painful.  In  the  past,  investors  magically
assumed  flawless  execution  and  fired  executives  who  failed.  It’s  time  to
reflect, thinking seriously about the company’s genuine chances for scalable,
profitable  success.  It’s  a  hard  decision,  particularly  for  self-confident
entrepreneurs  who  pride  themselves  on  their  tenacity,  and  problem-solving
abilities.  “I’m  an  entrepreneur.  I  make  things  happen  against  all  odds”  just
doesn’t  cut  it  when  staring  at  the  hard  facts  and  statistics.  Don’t  confuse
hubris with passion or facts.

Did  validation  really  convert  opinions  to  facts,  or  is  everyone  just

 
moving  the  goalposts  to  reach  customer  creation?  The  next  step  seriously
cranks  up  the  company’s  cash  burn  rate,  sharply  diminishing  if  not
extinguishing available cash or runway.

Did the product sell well and easily? Is it absolutely, unequivocally clear
that  when  more  money  is  spent  to  acquire  customers,  they’ll  arrive  at  a
steady,  predictable,  profitable  pace?  This  question  in  particular  probably
sends 90 percent of startups back into the depths of Customer Development
to refine and retest components of the business model.

If the “ramp” to more customers, revenue and profits isn’t proved to be
predictable  in  test  results,  it’s  also  a  reason  to  pivot.  Using  everything  you
learned in customer validation, go back to Phase 1 of this step (get ready to
sell) and try it again. Sorry. This isn’t easy to do.

If everything checks out (again, it seldom does the first time around), the
end  of  customer  validation  is  a  major  milestone.  Customer  problems  are
understood,  a  set  of  earlyvangelists  has  been  found,  and  the  company  has
delivered  a  product  its  customers  want  to  buy,  developed  a  repeatable  and
scalable  sales  process,  and  demonstrated  a  profitable  business  model.
Hopefully,  all  the  learning  is  captured  in  writing  and  the  business  model
diagram is updated. Fund-raising, while never easy, will be far easier than at
this point than it was before.

When  you’ve  answered  “yes”  to  that  taxing  list  of  questions,  you
deserve a night off, if not a week. Congratulations! The company is prepared
to move full speed ahead to the customer creation process.

 What’s Next?

The first two steps of Customer Development are where entrepreneurs live or
die  in  the  search  for  a  repeatable  and  scalable  business  model.  When  a
company  has  successfully  exited  Customer  Validation,  there’s  a  library  full
of business-building texts available to help execute the business model. So, at
least  for  now,  if  you’re  eager  to  execute  the  next  two  steps—Customer
Creation  and  Company  Building—return  to  the  original  Four  Steps  to  the
Epiphany, or turn to a more targeted text for fine-tuned support.

Whatever  you  do  next,  the  successful  completion  of  Customer
Validation  is  a  momentous  step  in  the  life  of  your  startup.  You  have
completed  an  arduous,  challenging  journey.  Our  warmest,  most  sincere
congratulations. We look forward to learning about your success!

How to Build a Web Startup: A Simple Overview
The Startup Owner’s Manual for Web/Mobile Channel Startups Index

How to Read This Book

CLEARLY, THE STARTUP OWNER’S MANUAL IS not a novel. This book is a step-
by-step  how-to  guide  that  details  a  process  for  building  a  successful,
profitable, scalable startup. It has more in common with a car repair manual
than it does with your favorite page-turner. Don’t attempt to read this book in
a single sitting or long weekend. It will be your companion—and, we hope,
your very best friend—for the six to 30 months or more that it often takes to
begin building a successful, scalable startup business.

Organization

This  book  is  organized  in  four  distinct  sections.  The  first,  Getting  Started,
features  the  “Customer  Development  Manifesto,”  a  series  of  14  guiding
principles for startups deploying the Customer Development process.

Don’t read too much at a time.

The next section, Step One, “Customer Discovery,” turns the founders’
vision  into  a  business  model  canvas  and  then  into  a  series  of  hypotheses.
Those hypotheses are turned into experiments, and tested with customers to
see  if  your  understanding  of  the  customer  problem  and  proposed  solution
mesh.

Step  Two,  “Customer  Validation,”  expands  the  scope  of  the  business
model testing to see if you can get enough orders or users to prove that you
have a repeatable and scalable business model.

Interspersed throughout is a series of Checklists that help you track your
progress  at  every  stage  of  the  Customer  Development  process.  Use  the
checklists at the end of each step (yes, there’s one for each) to make sure you
have completed all the key tasks outlined in that step. Download them, share
them, and circulate them to team members. But most important, use them to
be sure you have completed each step—before you move on to the next.

 
Paths Through This Book

     •   Read the glossary first. Customer Development has a language all its

own.

     •   Before you dive into the details, read the Customer Development

Manifesto.

     •   If you are familiar with Customer Development, skim Chapters 1-2,

start with Chapter 3, “the business model hypotheses.”

     •   If you want to align co-founders, initial employees, investors and

advisors around the Customer Development philosophy, have them
read The Startup Owner’s Manual Strategy Edition.

     •   If you want a high-speed overview and little more, there are two

approaches:

          (a)  skim the checklists at the end of each step, which will give you a
sense of all the tasks you must complete to implement Customer
Development; or

          (b)  flip through the book, looking for “jumbo quotes” like this:

This book is not a novel... It’s a reference manual.

These  quotes  highlight  the  100  or  so  “big  ideas”  found  throughout  the

book and offer a “CliffsNotes” or “Twitter” sense of the text.

     •   If you want a detailed checklist of the things founders need to get right,

start with Chapter 3, “the business model hypothesis,” and use the
checklists in at the end of each step.

     •   If your startup is well under way, you might want to start at Chapter 6,

“Pivot or Proceed,” to gauge your progress. Then you can jump to
Chapter 11, “Metrics that Matter,” to see if you’re ready to scale.

     •   To develop and test a web/mobile minimum viable product (MVP),
read: Design Tests, Build Your Low Fidelity MVP, Low Fidelity
MVP Problem Test, and Optimize Getting More Customers.

     •   To focus on web/mobile marketing (how to “get,” “keep” and “grow”

 
customers), read:

   Hypotheses: Customer Source/Wiring, Channels, and Customer

Relationships.

   Build Your Low Fidelity MVP, Low Fidelity MVP Problem Test,
Traffic/Competitive Analysis, High Fidelity MVP Test, and
Measure Customer Behavior.

   Get Ready to Sell: Craft Positioning Statement, Acquire/ Activate
Customers Plan, Create a High Fidelity MVP, Build a Metrics
Tool Set, and Hire a Data Analytics Chief.

   Get Out of the Building: Prepare Optimization Plans/Tools,
Optimize Getting More Customers, Optimize “Keep” and
“Grow”), Test Sell Traffic Partners.

     •   Educators who want to teach Customer Development or the experiential

Lean LaunchPad class should read:

   Our website, www.steveblank.com, with links to our syllabi used at

Stanford, Berkeley and the National Science Foundation.

   Before the class meets, have the students read:

               —  The Customer Development Manifesto in Chapter 1

               —  An Introduction to Customer Discovery in Chapter 2

   Each week’s lectures are organized around each of the individual

hypotheses in Phase 1.

   For the Lean LaunchPad class, have students read:

               —  Get Out of the Building and Test the Problem in Chapter 4.

               —  Get Out of the Building and Test the Product Solution in

Chapter 5.

   All classes should read:

               —  Pivot or Proceed, in Chapter 6.

               —  Metrics that Matter, in Chapter 11.

USE the book, don’t just read it!

Use the checklists. There is one for every step.
Don’t  read  too  much  at  a  time.  This  is  a  reference  manual.  It’s

exhausting when read as a book.

Scan ahead.  It  gives  you  context  for  what  you  are  currently  doing.  If
you’re starting work on Chapter 3, for example, quickly scan Chapter 4 first
so you understand how what you’re doing now supports what comes next.

process 

Entrepreneurship is not a cookbook or a checklist. At the end of the day,
founders  are  artists.  Don’t  expect  everything  to  work  like  the  book.  It’s
impossible for this book to address every entrepreneurial decision and every
type of startup. You’re outside the building not only looking for facts, but for
insight  and  inspiration.  Not  every  piece  of  advice  fits  every  situation  you’ll
encounter.  And  not  every  piece  of  advice  will  always  work.  That’s  what
entrepreneurs are for.

The Customer Development Manifesto

CHAPTER 1

The Customer Development
Manifesto

BEFORE  DIVING  HEADFIRST  INTO  THE  DETAILS of the Customer Development
process,  it’s  crucial  to  review  the  14  rules  that  make  up  The  Customer
Development Manifesto. Embrace them. Review them regularly with the team
and (maybe after the IPO) consider perhaps even etching them in marble at
world headquarters.

Rule No. 1:

There Are No Facts Inside Your Building, So Get
Outside.

On  Day  One,  the  startup  is  a  faith-based  enterprise  built  on  its  founders’
vision  and  a  notable  absence  of  facts.  The  founders’  job  is  to  translate  this
vision and these hypotheses into facts. Facts live outside the building, where
future customers (prospects, really) live and work, so that’s where you need
to go. Nothing is more fundamental to Customer Development, and nothing
is harder to do. It’s much easier to write code, build hardware, have meetings
and write reports than it is to find and listen to potential customers. But that’s
what separates the winners from the losers.

Facts live outside the building, where future
customers live and work...

 
In  Customer  Development,  the  founders  gather  firsthand  experience
about  every  component  of  the  business  model.  The  team  can  support  the
founders,  but  firsthand  experience  by  definition  cannot  be  delegated.  This
customer research must be done by founders because:

Key  customer  feedback  points  are  random,  unpredictable,  and  often
painful to hear. Employees hate to deliver bad news to higher-ups

Employees have far less at stake and seldom listen as acutely, and they
don’t  get  heard  adequately  when  they  report  back.  It’s  too  easy  to
dismiss  their  findings  as  “hearsay”  or  to  ignore  critical  points  of
feedback

Consultants have even less at stake than employees and often color their
commentary  to  either  tell  the  client  what  he  wants  to  hear  or  deliver
messages that can lead to extended consulting relationships. This is also
second-  or  third-hand  feedback  and  too  diluted  or  diffused  to  provide
value

Only a founder can embrace the feedback, react to it, and adeptly make

the decisions necessary to change or pivot key business model components.

Rule No. 2:

Pair Customer Development with Agile
Development

Customer Development is useless unless the product
development organization can iterate the product
with speed and agility.

Customer  Development 
the  product  development
is  useless  unless 
organization  can  iterate  the  product  with  speed  and  agility.  If  Engineering
builds  the  product  using  waterfall  development,  it  will  be  deaf,  dumb  and
blind to customer input except during a short period when it’s specifying the

 
product.  The  rest  of  the  time,  engineers  are  locked  into  an  implementation
cycle,  unable  to  change  the  product  features  without  intolerable  delay.  By
contrast,  a  startup  engineering  organization  using  an  agile  methodology  is
designed to continually take customer input and deliver a product that iterates
readily around an MVP or its minimum feature set.

In  this  book,  agile  engineering/development  refers  to  the  rapid
deployment,  iterative  development  and  continuous  discovery  processes  that
hardware  or  software  companies  can  use.  We  don’t  advocate  any  particular
flavor,  just  its  necessity.  The  Customer  Development  process  provides  the
continuous customer input to make agile work.

Before the company even starts, the founders need to reach a deep and

inexorable commitment to the customer/agile development partnership.

Rule No. 3:

Failure is an Integral Part of the Search

One of the key differences between a startup and an existing company is the
one that’s never explicitly stated: “startups go from failure to failure.”

In  contrast,  existing  companies  have  learned  what  works  and  doesn’t.
Failures  in  an  existing  company  are  an  exception.  They  happen  when
someone  screws  up.  In  a  startup,  you’re  searching,  not  executing,  and  the
only way to find the right path is to try lots of experiments and take a lot of
wrong turns. Failure is part of the process.

If you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined
to do so.

Failures  are  not  truly  failures,  per  se  but  an  integral  part  of  the  startup
learning process. You’ll be running dozens if not hundreds of pass/fail tests
—on your pitch, your features, your pricing, and on and on—so get ready to
accept  failure  and  move  on.  When  something  isn’t  working,  successful
founders orient themselves to the new facts, decide what needs fixing, and act
decisively.

The  Customer  Development  process  demands  frequent,  agile  iteration,

 
followed,  of  course,  by  testing  of  the  iteration  that  often  leads  to  another
iteration or pivot, which leads to more testing and...

If you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined to do so.

Rule No. 4:

Make Continuous Iterations and Pivots

The  strategy  of  embracing  failure  in  Customer  Development  demands
frequent, agile iteration and pivots. A pivot is a substantive change in one or
more of the nine boxes of the business model canvas. (For example, a pricing
change  from  freemium  to  subscription  model  or  a  customer  segment  shift
from  boys  12-15  years  old  to  women  45-60.)  Or  it  can  be  more  complex,
such as a change of target customer or user. Iterations, meanwhile, are minor
changes  to  business  model  components  (e.g.,  changing  pricing  from  $99  to
$79).

Groupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot is a perfect
example.

When  a  company  is  limping  along,  only  a  dramatic  change  to  one  or
more  business  model  components  can  get  it  back  on  the  road  to  success.
Groupon’s  legendary  $12  billion  pivot  (their  IPO  valuation)  is  a  perfect
example.  Groupon  was  started  from  a  company  called  the  Point.  It  was
struggling, at best, as a social media platform working to get people together
to solve problems, but was about to run out of money.

The most effective campaigns on The Point were those that saved people
money  by  grouping  or  bundling  their  purchases.  The  founders  started
blogging various deals from different businesses each day. They called this,
“Get Your Groupon.com.” Groupon’s first offer hit in October of 2008: buy
two pizzas for the  price  of  one  in  the  shop  on  the  first  floor  of  its  Chicago
headquarters. Twenty  people bought the deal and the company was well on
its way to its $12-billion pivot.

Pivots are driven by the learnings and insight from a continuous stream

of “pass/fail” tests you run throughout discovery and validation.

 
The best startup founders don’t hesitate to make the change. They admit

when hypotheses are wrong and adapt.

Rule No. 5:

No Business Plan Survives First Contact with
Customers So Use a Business Model Canvas

Entrepreneurs often mistake their business plan as a cookbook for execution,
failing to recognize that it is only a collection of unproven assumptions. At its
back, a revenue plan blessed by an investor, and composed overwhelmingly
of  guesses,  suddenly  becomes  an  operating  plan  driving  hiring,  firing,  and
spending. Insanity.

is 

The difference between a static business plan and a
dynamic model could well be the difference between
flameout and success.

The  difference  between  a  static  business  plan  and  a  dynamic  business
model could well be the difference between a flameout and success. Startups
should dump the business plan and adopt the flexible business model.

A  business  model  describes  the  flow  between  key  components  of  the

company:

value proposition, which the company offers (product/service, benefits)

customer segments, such as users, and payers, or moms or teens

distribution  channels  to  reach  customers  and  offer  them  the  value
proposition

customer relationships to create demand

revenue streams generated by the value proposition(s)

 
resources needed to make the business model possible

activities necessary to implement the business model

partners who participate in the business and their motivations for doing
so

cost structure resulting from the business model

The business model canvas (see Figure 1.1) presents a visual overview
of  the  nine  components  of  a  business  on  one  page.  In  this  book,  Alexander
Osterwalder’s business model canvas serves as the scorecard for the customer
discovery process described in Step One. Osterwalder’s book Business Model
Generation (Wiley, 2010) provides the structure for the canvas.

Business Model Canvas (Figure 1.1)

As a startup moves through the Customer Development process, it will
use  the  business  model  canvas  as  a  scorecard,  by  posting  the  hypotheses

about each component of the model and then revising the hypotheses as the
founders  gather  facts.  Think  of  your  first  version  of  the  business  model
canvas as the starting point showing the hypotheses that must be confirmed in
face-to-face  or  online  interaction  with  customers.  More  often  than  not,  the
customers  will  reject  components  of  the  business  model,  saying,  “I’d  rather
buy that from a retailer,” or, “The product needs to have these features to be
important  to  me.”  As  customers  approve  or  dispute  the  business  model
hypotheses, the company either accepts the customers’ approval or pivots to
change its business model to better target the opportunity.

Using the business model canvas as a guide makes it easier to figure out
where and how to pivot, since the team can visually diagram its alternatives
and see what it needs to change. Each time the founders iterate or pivot (see
Rule  No.  4)  in  response  to  customer  feedback,  they  draw  a  new  canvas
showing the changes. Over time, these multiple canvases form a “flip book”
that  shows  the  evolution  of  the  business  model.  Agile  startups  can  end  up
with a six-inch-thick stack of business model diagrams they can burn at the
IPO-celebration bonfire.

Much more about how to use business model diagrams to “keep score”

throughout the customer discovery process can be found in Chapter 2.

...hypothesis is just a fancy word for “guess.”

Rule No. 6:

Design Experiments and Test to Validate Your
Hypotheses

Initially, hypothesis is just a fancy word for “guess.” To turn hypotheses into
facts,  founders  need  to  get  out  of  the  building  and  test  them  in  front  of
customers.  But  how  do  you  test?  And  what  do  you  want  to  learn  from  the
tests? Testing and learning require you to be thoughtful on constructing and
designing your tests. We call this “designing the experiments.”

Customer  Development  experiments  are  short,  simple,  objective
pass/fail  tests.  You’re  looking  for  a  strong  signal  in  the  signal/noise  noise

 
ratio, something like five of the first 12 customers you call on saying “I need
this right now, even if it’s still buggy.” Early tests aren’t necessarily precise,
but should give you a “good enough” signal to proceed.

The Customer Development Insight Cycle (Figure 1.2)

Start  by  asking  yourself,  “What  insight  do  I  need  to  move  forward?”
Then ask, “What’s the simplest test I can run to get it?” Finally, think about,
“How do I design an experiment to run this simple test?”

One  of  the  things  that  trips  up  engineering  founders  is  thinking  that

these tests have to be actual code, hardware or the real product. Most of the
time you can mock-up the web page or create a demo or physical prototype to
elicit valuable learning.

Rule No. 7:

Agree on Market Type. It Changes Everything

One of the radical insights guiding this book is that not all startups are alike.
One of the key ways in which they are different is in the relationship between
a  startup’s  new  product  and  its  market.  These  product/market  relationships
generally fit one of these descriptions:

bringing a new product into an existing market

bringing a new product into a new market

bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to:

re-segment that market as a low-cost entrant or

re-segment that market as a niche entrant

cloning a business model that’s successful in another country

What confused entrepreneurs for decades is that the traditional product
introduction model works when introducing a product into an existing market
with a known business model (i.e., known customers, channels and markets).
However,  since  the  majority  of  startups  are  not  pursuing  known  markets
(those in new or re-segmented categories), they don’t really know who their
customers will be. These types of startups are searching for a repeatable and
scalable business model.

Market type influences everything a company does.

Market type influences everything a company does. Strategy and tactics
that  work  for  one  market  type  seldom  work  for  another.  Market  type
determines  the  startup’s  customer  feedback  and  acquisition  activities  and
spending.  It  changes  customer  needs,  adoption  rates,  product  features  and

 
positioning  as  well  as  its  launch  strategies,  channels  and  activities.  In  sum,
different  market  types  require  dramatically  different  discovery,  MVPs,  and
sales and marketing strategies.

In  existing  markets,  where  customers  exist,  marketing  is  relatively  easy:
users can describe the market and the attributes that matter the most to them.
The  new  product  or  service  typically  runs  faster,  does  something  better  or
cheaper,  or  otherwise  improves  on  a  customer-defined  attribute.  Users,  the
market, and competitors are known, and competition involves comparing the
product and its features with others.

In a new market, a company lets customers do something they couldn’t do
before  by  creating  something  that  never  existed  before.  Or  it  dramatically
lowers costs to create a new class of users. By definition, new markets have
no customers yet, so there’s nobody to know what the product can do or why
they  should  buy.  This  makes  getting  feedback  and  creating  demand
particularly  challenging,  since  the  product  is  unknown  to  users  and  the
market is undefined and unknown, and costly to develop.

The  key  isn’t  competing,  but  instead  understanding  whether  a  large
customer  base  exists  and  whether  customers  can  be  persuaded  to  buy.  A
classic founder error in a new market is the “fast-burn” spending of sales and
marketing funds, a practice that may be appropriate when selling to existing
customers in a known market, but makes no sense in a new market. The new-
vs.-existing axis is at the core of the market-type definition.

Re-segmenting  an  existing  market  is  useful  when  the  incumbent  is  too
difficult  to  attack  head-on  (like  Amazon,  Facebook,  or  Microsoft).  A  re-
segmentation  strategy  is  based  on  the  startup’s  market  and  customer
knowledge,  ideally  identifying  a  market  opportunity  that  incumbents  are
missing, which usually takes one of two forms: a low-cost strategy or a niche
strategy.  (Unlike  differentiation,  segmentation  forges  a  distinct  spot  in
customers’ minds that is unique, valuable, and in demand.)

Low-cost  re-segmentation  is  just  what  it  sounds  like.  Are  there
customers at the low end of an existing market who will buy “good enough”
performance at a substantially lower price?

Niche  re-segmentation  looks  at  an  existing  market  and  asks  whether
some segment of this market would buy a new product designed to address
more  specific  needs.  Can  some  sizable  portion  of  the  market  be  convinced
that a characteristic of the new product is radical enough to change the rules

and  shape  of  an  existing  market.  See  Chan  Kim  and  Renee  Mauborgne’s
work on “Blue Ocean Strategy” for another way to think of re-segmenting a
market.

Cloning  an  existing  business  model  is  a  powerful  technique  when  an
existing  business  has  been  proven  in  one  country  but  has  not  yet  been
introduced in another. Startups in Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan and
China  (each  with  its  own  large  local  market  and  language  and  cultural
barriers)  can  adopt,  borrow,  or  copy  a  successful  American  business  model
and customize it for local language and buying preferences. (Soon ideas from
those countries will be cloned in the U.S.)

For example, Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia are the equivalent of
Google  in  their  respective  markets.  And  Qzone,  RenRen,  PengYou  and
Kaixin are the Facebooks of China, while Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki play
the same role in Russia.

Startup  companies  generally  enter  one  of  these  four  market  types  and
ultimately  must  commit  to  one.  The  consequences  of  a  wrong  market-type
choice will prove to be severe in the customer creation stage. While market
type is ultimately a “late-binding decision,” a working hypothesis helps frame
early customer discovery issues. Market-type decision-making is explored in
greater detail in Chapter 2.

Startup Metrics Differ from Those in Existing

businesses—P&Ls  balance  sheets,  cash-flow  forecasts  and  line-of-business
analyses,  plus  scores  of  others.  Here’s  hoping  your  startup  becomes  big
enough to need them someday. In the past (not so long ago), we used these

 
tools  with  startups  because  we  didn’t  know  what  else  to  measure.  We  now
know  that  startup  metrics  should  focus  on  tracking  the  startup’s  progress
converting  guesses  and  hypotheses  into  incontrovertible  facts  rather  than
measuring  the  execution  of  a  static  plan.  It’s  critical  that  board  and
management  continuously  test  and  measure  each  hypothesis  until  the  entire
business model is worth scaling into a company.

If the company is venture-backed, management and investors must agree
on a set of metrics that truly matter and work toward a report or “dashboard”
that  essentially  replaces  the  P&L,  cash  flow,  and  balance  sheet  as
centerpieces of early board meetings.
Startup metrics track the results of pass/fail tests and the iterations they lead
to:

Have the customer problem and product features been validated?

Does the minimum feature set resonate with customers?

Who  in  fact  is  the  customer,  and  have  initial  customer-related
hypotheses  on  the  likes  of  value  proposition,  customer  segments,  and
channels been validated through face-to-face customer interaction?

Customer-validation  questions  might  include:  average  order  size,
customer lifetime value, average time to first order, rate of sales pipeline
growth, improvement in close rate, and revenue per salesperson.

In  addition  to  the  startup  metrics  above,  the  relatively  few  financial
metrics that a startup board should be tracking are cash-burn rate, number of
months’ worth of cash left, short-term hiring plans, and amount of time until
the company reaches cash-flow break-even.

Make sure decisions are fact-based, not faith-based.

Rule No. 9:

Fast Decision-Making, Cycle Time, Speed and
Tempo

 
Speed  matters  at  startups  where  the  only  absolute  certainty  is  that  the  bank
balance declines every day. While Rule No. 4 addresses iterations and pivots,
it  doesn’t  specify  how  long  they  should  take.  Unequivocally,  the  faster  the
better,  since  the  faster  these  “learn,  build,  pivot”  or  “iterate,  build”  cycles
happen,  the  greater  the  odds  of  finding  a  scalable  business  model  with  the
cash  on  hand.  If  cycles  happen  too  slowly,  the  startup  runs  out  of  cash  and
dies.  The  biggest  impediment  to  cycle  time  is  psychological:  it  requires  the
admission of being wrong or even of suffering a short-term tactical defeat.

While pivots and iterations are about speed outside the building, speed
also matters inside the company. Most startup decisions are made in the face
of  uncertainty.  There’s  seldom  a  clear-cut,  perfect  solution  to  any
engineering,  customer  or  competitor  problem,  and  founders  shouldn’t
agonize  over  trying  to  find  one.  This  doesn’t  mean  gambling  with  the
company’s fortunes on a whim. It means adopting plans with an acceptable
degree  of  risk  and  doing  so  quickly.  (Make  sure  these  decisions  are  fact-
based, not faith-based.) In general, the company that consistently makes and
implements decisions rapidly gains a tremendous, often-decisive competitive
advantage.

...startups should make reversible decisions before
anyone leaves the CEO’s office.

Startup  decisions  have  two  states:  reversible  and  irreversible.  A
reversible  decision  could  be  adding  or  dropping  a  product  feature  or  a  new
algorithm in the code or targeting a specific set of customers. If the decision
proves  a  bad  one,  it  can  be  unwound  in  a  reasonable  period  of  time.  An
irreversible  decision  such  as  firing  an  employee,  launching  a  product,  or
signing  a  long  lease  on  expensive  office  space  is  usually  difficult  or
impossible to reverse.

Startups  should  as  policy,  make  reversible  decisions  before  anyone
leaves the CEO’s office or before a meeting ends. Perfect decision-making is
both  unimportant  and  impossible,  and  what  matters  more  is  forward
momentum  and  a  tight,  fact-based  feedback  loop  to  quickly  recognize  and
reverse bad decisions. By the time a big company gets the committee to get
the  subcommittee  to  pick  a  meeting  date,  most  startups  have  made  20
decisions, reversed five, and implemented the other 15.

 
Learning  to  make  decisions  quickly  is  just  part  of  the  equation.  Agile
startups  have  mastered  another  trick:  tempo—the  ability  to  make  quick
decisions consistently and at all levels in the company. Speed and tempo are
integral parts of startup DNA, and a great startup’s tempo is often 10 times
that of a large company.

Rule No. 10:

It’s All About Passion

A startup without driven, passionate people is dead the day it opens its doors.
“Startup people” are different. They think different. In contrast, most people
are great at execution. They work to live, do their jobs well, and enjoy their
family,  their  lives,  their  hobbies  and  often  even  enjoy  mowing  the  lawn.
They’re terrific at executing fixed tasks, and it’s a wonderful life for almost
everyone.

The  people  leading  almost  every  successful  startup  in  history  are  just
different.  They’re  a  very  tiny  percentage  of  the  world  population,  and  their
brains  are  wired  for  chaos,  uncertainty,  and  blinding  speed.  They’re
irrationally  focused  on  customer  needs  and  delivering  great  products.  Their
job  is  their  life.  It’s  not  9-to-5,  it’s  24/7.  These  are  the  people  who  found
high-growth, highly-successful scalable startups.

Startups demand execs who are comfortable with
uncertainty, chaos and change.

Rule No. 11:

Startup Job Titles Are Very Different from a Large
Company’s

In  an  existing  company,  job  titles  reflect  the  way  tasks  are  organized  to

 
execute a known business model. For example, the “Sales” title in an existing
company means there’s a sales team repeatedly selling a known product to a
well-understood group of customers, using a standard corporate presentation
with  an  existing  price  list  and  standard  terms,  conditions  and  contract.  The
“Sales” title in an existing company is all about execution around a series of
knowns.

Compared with big companies, startups need executives whose skills are
180  degrees  different.  Startups  demand  execs  who  are  comfortable  with
uncertainty,  chaos  and  change—with  presentations  and  offers  changing
daily,  with  the  product  changing  often,  with  probing  and  gaining  insights
from  failure  rather  than  high-fiving  a  success.  In  short,  they  need  the  rare
breed:

open to learning and discovery—highly curious, inquisitive, and creative

eager to search for a repeatable and scalable business model

agile enough to deal with daily change and operating “without a map”

readily able to wear multiple hats, often on the same day

comfortable celebrating failure when it leads to learning and iteration

We suggest replacing traditional execution-oriented sales, marketing and
business  development  titles  with  a  single  title:  the  Customer  Development
team. At first, this “team” will consist of the company’s founder(s), who talks
with  customers  to  gain  enough  insights  to  develop  the  minimum  viable
product. Later, as the startup moves into customer validation, the team may
grow  to  include  a  dedicated  “sales  closer”  responsible  for  the  logistics  of
getting  early  orders  signed.  The  closer  shouldn’t  be  confused  with  a
traditional sales VP. To succeed in this process, the team must have:

the ability to listen to customer objections and understand whether they
are issues about the product, the presentation, the pricing or something
else (or the wrong type of customer)

experience in talking to and moving between customers and engineers

confidence amid a state of constant change, often operating “without a
map”

the  ability  to  walk  in  their  customers’  shoes,  understanding  how  they
work and the problems they face

Some would say this checklist isn’t bad for identifying great entrepreneurs.

Rule No. 12:

Preserve All Cash Until Needed. Then Spend.

The  goal  of  Customer  Development  is  not  to  avoid  spending  money  but  to
preserve  cash  while  searching  for  the  repeatable  and  scalable  business
model.  Once  found,  then  spend  like  there’s  no  tomorrow.  This  paragraph  is
worth deconstructing:

Preserve  cash:  When  a  startup  has  unlimited  cash  (Internet  bubbles,
frothy venture climate), it can iterate on its mistakes by burning more dollars.
When  money  is  tight,  without  dollars  to  redo  mistakes,  it’s  crucial  to
minimize  waste.  The  Customer  Development  process  preserves  cash  by  not
hiring  any  sales  and  marketing  staff  until  the  founders  turn  hypotheses  into
facts and discover a viable product/market fit.

While searching: Customer Development observes that at the start, the
company  and  its  business  model  are  based  solely  on  hypotheses,  not  facts,
and that the founders need to get out of the building to turn these hypotheses
into customer data. This “get out of the building” approach, combined with
rapid  iteration  and  pivots,  is  central  to  the  model’s  customer  discovery  and
validation steps.

...preserve cash while searching for the repeatable
and scalable business model...

Repeatable:  Startups  may  get  orders  that  stem  from  board  members’
customer relationships, engineering one-offs, or heroic single-shot efforts by
the CEO. These are great, but they aren’t repeatable by a sales organization.
Search  not  for  the  one-off  revenue  hits  but  rather  for  a  pattern  that  can  be
replicated  by  a  sales  organization  selling  off  a  price  list  or  by  customers
regularly visiting the website.

 
Scalable: The goal is not to get one customer but many—and for each
additional customer to add incremental revenue and profit. The test is: Does
the addition of one more salesperson or more marketing dollars bring in more
gross  profit  (or  users  or  clicks)  than  you  invested?  Who  influences  a  sale?
Who recommends a sale? Who is the decision-maker? Who is the economic
buyer?  Where’s  the  budget  for  purchasing  this  type  of  product?  What’s  the
customer acquisition cost? Affirming the repeatable, scalable sales model is
the  customer  validation  step  of  Customer  Development,  its  most  important
phase. Has the team learned how to sell a target customer? Can this happen
before the startup runs out of money?

Search not for the one-off revenue hits but rather
for a pattern...

Business model: A business model answers the basic questions of how
the company makes money. Is this a revenue play, or is it a freemium model
seeking users? Something else? Who’s the customer?

Spend like there’s no tomorrow: The goal of an investor-backed startup
is  not  to  build  a  lifestyle  business.  The  goal  is  to  reach  venture  scale  (10
times the return on investment or more). When management and board agree
that  they’ve  found  a  repeatable  and  scalable  sales  model  (i.e.,  have  a
product/market  fit),  then  invest  the  dollars  to  create  end-user  demand  and
drive those customers into the sales channel.

Rule No. 13:

Communicate and Share Learning

An  integral  part  of  Customer  Development’s  “learning  and  discovery”
philosophy  is  sharing  everything  that’s  learned  outside  the  building  with
employees, co-founders and even investors.

The traditional way to do this is via weekly company meetings to keep
employees  informed  and  board  meetings  to  let  the  investors  understand  the
progress  made  in  the  search  for  the  business  model.  But  technology  in  the
21st-century has taken us to places we never could get to before. We can now

 
communicate  all  we’re  learning  in  near-real  time  to  everyone  who  needs  to
know.

We  strongly  recommend  that  the  founders  keep  and  share  all  their
activities  in  the  customer  discovery  step  via  a  blog,  CRM  or  product
management tool. A powerful tool to help founding team members and their
investors and advisors communicate about progress in evolving their business
model  and  sharing  or  discussing  customer  discovery  has  been  developed  in
concert  with  the  authors  and  can  be  found  at  LaunchPadCentral.com.  It
records  hypotheses  the  startup  started  with,  who  the  team  has  talked  to,  the
questions asked, the tests conducted, what’s been learned, and questions for
advisors  or  investors.  While  this  may  seem  burdensome,  it  takes  less  time
than having a weekly coffee with an advisory board member. What results is
a communications tool allowing outsiders to view the company’s progress up
close and to offer suggestions and course corrections.

Rule No. 14:

Customer Development Success Begins With Buy-
In

Customer  Development’s  “learning  and  discovery”  philosophy  can  be
immensely disorienting to a founder, engineer or investor who has spent his
or  her  career  executing  a  plan.  For  Customer  Development  to  succeed,
everyone  on  the  team—from  investor  or  parent  company  to  engineers,
marketeers  and  founders—needs  to  understand  and  agree  that  the  Customer
Development process is different to its core. If the engineering VP is talking
waterfall  development  or  the  board  demands  a  rigid  timetable,  Customer
Development  is  destined  for  disaster.  Everyone  must  accept  the  process,
recognizing that this is a fluid, nonlinear search for a business model that can
sometimes last for years.

The Customer Development process is different to
its core.

Customer Development changes almost every aspect of startup behavior,

 
performance,  metrics,  and,  as  often  as  not,  success  potential.  It’s  not  just  a
“nice to do” while executing the revenue model in the back of the business
plan.  Customer  Development  reinvents  the  business  model  on  the  fly,
iterating  often  and  pivoting  whenever  indicated.  Founders  need  to  have  the
commitment  of  the  team  and  board  before  embarking  on  Customer
Development.  Ensure  that  all  understand  and  agree  that  it’s  iterative,
necessary,  and  worthwhile  and  that  it  changes  the  benchmarks  and  metrics
along the way.

Comments such as “The product is already spec’ed, and we can’t change
the  features  since  development  is  already  underway,”  or  “We  already  have
the  factory  (or  sales  team  or  marketing  materials)  built,”  or  “We  have  to
launch  to  make  the  numbers  in  the  plan,”  are  all  red  flags.  To  succeed  at
Customer  Development,  the  company  must  abandon  the  old  model’s
emphasis on execution of a fantasy business plan. Instead it must commit to a
Customer  Development  process  stressing  learning,  discovery,  failure,  and
iteration in the search for a successful business model. If you’re ready for this
process, this book will tell you how to do it.

Summary: The Customer Development
Process

The  Customer  Development  process  reflects  the  best  practices  of  winning
startups.  It  is  the  only  approach  for  web-based  businesses  where  failure  is
certain  without  constant  customer  feedback  and  product  iteration  as  they
search  for  their  audiences.  Customer  Development’s  fast  cycle  times  and
inherent  cash  conservation  gives  all  entrepreneurs  more  chances  to  pivot,
iterate, and succeed before the bank account runs dry. Describe this model to
entrepreneurs who have taken companies all the way to a lucrative exit and
beyond, and heads nod in recognition.

While each step has its own specific objectives, the process as a whole
has one overarching goal: discovering the repeatable, scalable, and ultimately
profitable business before running out of cash. This transforms the company
from a set of founding hypotheses into a moneymaking endeavor.

Customer Development is damn hard work. You
can’t fake it.

Customer Development is damn hard work. You can’t fake it. You can’t
just do the slides or “do” the process in a weekend. It’s a full-time, full-body-
contact sport. It’s a long-term commitment to changing the way a startup is
built. But it’s also proven to increase the chances of startup success.

An Introduction to Customer Discovery

No startup business plan survives first contact with customers.

—Steve Blank

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

—Lao Tzu

IRIDIUM  WAS  ONE  OF  THE  BIGGEST  STARTUP  gambles  ever  made—a  bold  and
audacious $5.2 billion bet. Founded by Motorola and a global partnership of
18  companies  in  1991,  Iridium  planned  to  build  a  mobile  telephone  system
that would work “anywhere on Earth,” from ships in the middle of the ocean
to  the  jungles  of  Africa  to  remote  mountain  peaks  where  no  cell  towers
existed.

How?  With  an  out-of-this-world  business  plan.  First,  the  company
bought  a  fleet  of  15  rockets  from  Russia,  the  U.S.  and  China.  Next,  it
launched an armada of 72 private satellites into orbit, where they acted like
500-mile-high  cell  towers  providing  phone  coverage  to  any  spot  on  Earth.
Seven  years  after  Iridium’s  founding,  its  satellites  were  in  place.  But  nine
months after the first call was made in 1998, the company was in Chapter 11
bankruptcy.  When  Iridium  crashed  back  to  Earth,  it  ranked  as  one  of  the
largest startup failures on record. What went wrong?

When Iridium was founded in 1991, worldwide cell-phone coverage was
sparse, unreliable and expensive. Cell-phone handsets were the size of lunch
boxes.  Iridium  put  together  a  business  plan  that  made  assumptions  about
customers,  their  problems  and  the  product  needed  to  solve  those  problems.
Other  assumptions  about  sales  channel,  partnerships,  and  revenue  model  all
added  up  to  a  set  of  financial  forecasts  that  Iridium  would  soon  be  printing
money.

One of the largest startup failures on record as they
executed their business plan.

But in the seven-plus years it took Iridium to go from concept to launch,
innovation in mobile- and cell-phone networks moved at blinding speed. By
the  time  Iridium  launched,  there  were  far  fewer  places  on  the  planet  where
cell-phone  service  was  unavailable.  Traditional  cell-phone  companies
provided  coverage  in  the  most  valuable  parts  of  the  world.  Prices  for  cell
service  shrunk  as  fast  as  phone  handsets  did.  In  contrast,  Iridium’s  satellite
phone was bigger than a brick and weighed about as much. Worse, Iridium’s
cell phone couldn’t make calls from cars or buildings, since it required line-
of-sight  “connection”  to  the  satellites.  Instead  of  50  cents  per  minute  for  a
regular cell call, Iridium’s calls cost $7 a minute, plus $3,000 for the handset
itself.

Iridium’s potential market shrunk nearly every day. Instead of a massive
worldwide market of potential users, it had drawn only a small group willing
to  pay  its  prices  and  put  up  with  the  product’s  many  limitations.  But
Iridium’s business model assumptions and plans were firmly fixed as if it was
still 1991. The company spent $5 billion building a business over eight years
without ever focusing on four key questions:

Have we identified a problem a customer wants to see solved?

Does our product solve this customer problem or need?

If so, do we have a viable and profitable business model?

Have we learned enough to go out and sell?

Answering  these  questions  is  the  purpose  of  the  first  step  in  the

customer discovery process. This chapter explains how to go about it.

(Twenty  years  later,  Iridium  emerged  from  bankruptcy.  In  2000,  an
investor group bought $6 billion worth of its assets for $25 million. After a
long climb back, the company celebrated its 500,000th customer in September
2011.)

Customers don’t behave like your business plan.

 
 
The Customer Discovery Philosophy

A startup begins with the vision of its founders: a vision of a new product or
service that solves a customer’s problems or needs and of how it will reach
its many customers. Customer discovery lowers the odds of spending zillions
and  getting  zeros  in  return  as  the  Iridium  team  did.  So  the  No.  1  goal  of
customer discovery amounts to this: turning the founders’ initial hypotheses
about their market and customers into facts.

Get Out of the Building

Facts  exist  only  outside  the  building,  where  customers  live,  so  the  most
important aspect of customer discovery is getting out of the building, in front
of customers. And not for a few days or a week, but repeatedly, over weeks if
not months. This critical task can’t be assigned to junior staffers and must be
driven  by  founders.  Only  after  the  founders  have  performed  this  step  will
they know whether they have a valid vision or just a hallucination.

Sounds  simple,  doesn’t  it?  But  for  anyone  who  has  worked  in
established companies, the customer discovery process is disorienting. All the
rules  about  new-product  management  in  large  companies  are  turned  upside
down. It’s instructive to enumerate all things you are not going to do:

understand the needs and wants of all customers

make  a  list  of  all  the  features  customers  want  before  they  buy  your
product

hand  Product  Development  a  features  list  of  the  sum  of  all  customer
requests

hand Product Development a detailed marketing-requirements document

run focus groups and test customers’ reactions to your product to see if
they will buy

What you are going to do is develop your product for the few, not the
many. Moreover, you’re going to start building your product even before you
know whether you have any customers for it.

On a startups first day, there’s limited—if any—
customer input.

For  an  experienced  marketing  or  product  management  executive,  these
ideas are not only disorienting and counterintuitive but heretical. Why aren’t
the  needs  of  all  potential  customers  important?  What  is  it  about  a  first
product  from  a  new  company  that’s  different  from  follow-on  products  in  a
large  company?  What  is  it  about  a  startup’s  first  customers  that  make  the
rules so different?

Search for the Problem/Solution Fit

The customer discovery process searches for problem/solution fit: “have we
found a problem lots of people want us to solve (or a need they want us to
fill)”  and  “does  our  solution  (a  product,  a  website,  or  an  app)  solve  the
problem in a compelling way?” At its core, the essence of customer discovery
is  to  determine  whether  your  startup’s  value  proposition  matches  the
customer segment it plans to target.

Problem/solution  fit  is  virtually  identical  to  what’s  sometimes  called
“product/ market fit,” as the previous paragraph indicates. As a result, we use
the  terms  somewhat  interchangeably  throughout  the  book.  Do  realize,
however,  that  in  multi-sided  markets,  there  may  be  multiple  value
propositions  and  multiple  customer  segments.  But  problem/solution  fit  is
only  achieved  when  the  revenue  model,  pricing,  and  customer  acquisition
efforts all match up with the customers’ needs.

Develop the Product for the Few, Not the Many

In  existing  companies,  the  goal  of  traditional  product  management  and
marketing  is  to  develop  a  market-requirements  document  (MRD)  for
engineering  that  contains  the  sum  of  all  possible  customer  feature  requests,
prioritized in a collaborative effort among Product Management, Marketing,
Sales,  and  Engineering.  Marketing  or  Product  Management  hosts  focus
groups,  analyzes  sales  data  from  the  field,  and  looks  at  customer  feature
requests  and  complaints.  This  information  leads  to  the  adding  of  requested

 
features  to  the  product  specification,  and  the  engineering  team  builds  them
into the next product release.

While  this  process  is  rational  for  an  established  company  entering  an
existing market, it’s folly for startups. Why? Startups aren’t small versions of
large,  existing  companies  where  there’s  plenty  of  customer  knowledge  and
input.  In  established  companies,  the  MRD  process  ensures  that  engineering
will  build  a  product  that  appeals  to  existing  customers  in  a  known  market,
where customers and their needs are known. On a startup’s first day, there’s
limited—if any—customer input for creating a formal product specification.

In  a  startup,  the  first  product  is  not  designed  to  satisfy  a  mainstream
customer.  No  startup  can  afford  to  build  a  product  with  every  feature  a
mainstream customer needs all at once. The product would take years to get
to market and be obsolete by the time it arrived. Instead, successful startups
solve this conundrum by focusing development and early selling efforts on a
very  small  group  of  early  customers  who  have  bought  into  the  startup’s
vision.  These  visionary  customers  will  give  the  company  the  feedback
necessary to add features to the product over time.

Earlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith
and buy an early product.

Earlyvangelists: The Most Important Customers of
All

Enthusiasts who spread the good news about your product to friends, family
or  co-workers  are  often  called  evangelists.  But  a  new  word  is  needed  to
describe  the  early  adopters—the  visionary  customers—who  buy  unfinished
and untested products, because they want to “first,” whether it’s for the sake
of gaining a competitive edge or winning bragging rights. We call these early
adopters earlyvangelists. Unlike “mainstream” business or consumer-product
customers  who  want  to  buy  a  finished,  completed,  tested  product,
earlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith and buy an early product
from a startup. Every industry has a small subset of visionaries willing to take
a leap of faith on an early product.

 
One  of  the  mistakes  that  startup  founders  make  is  to  give  away  or
heavily discount early alpha/beta products to blue-chip customers. In single-
sided markets (where the user is the payer) earlyvangelists will be happy to
pay for early access to the product. If they won’t, they aren’t earlyvangelists.
Their willingness to pay is a critical part of the customer discovery process.
You’ll use it to test the entire buying process.

Earlyvangelist Characteristics (Figure 2.1)

 In web/mobile apps, where multi-sided markets (separate users and
payers) are often found, earlyvangelists can be users or payers. But even as
nonpaying  users,  these  earlyvangelists  are  willing  or  eager  accelerators  of
your viral growth.

Earlyvangelists are willing or eager accelerators of
your viral growth.

In both physical and web/mobile channels, earlyvangelists display these

common characteristics (see Figure 2.1):

They have a problem or need.

They understand they have a problem.

They’re  actively  searching  for  a  solution  and  have  a  timetable  for
finding it.

The  problem  is  so  painful  that  they’ve  cobbled  together  an  interim
solution.

They’ve committed, or can quickly acquire, budget dollars to purchase.

Think of earlyvangelists’ characteristics along a scale of customer pain.
Earlyvangelist  customers  will  be  found  only  at  the  top  of  the  scale—those
who  have  already  been  looking  for  a  solution,  built  a  home-grown  solution
(whether in a company by building a software solution or at home by taping
together a fork, a light bulb and a vacuum cleaner) and have or can acquire a
budget.  These  people  are  perfect  earlyvangelist  candidates.  They  can  be
relied  on  for  feedback  and  initial  sales;  they’ll  tell  others  about  the  product
and spread the word that the vision is real. Moreover, they can be potential
advisory board candidates (more about advisory boards in Chapter 5).

Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) First

The idea that a startup builds its product for a small group of initial customers

 
rather  than  devising  a  generic  mainstream  spec  is  radical.  What  follows  is
equally revolutionary.

The goal of the MVP is to build the smallest possible
feature set.

On the day the company starts, there is very limited customer input. All
the startup has is a vision of what the problem, product and solution seem to
be. Unfortunately, it’s either a vision or a hallucination. The company doesn’t
know who its initial customers are or what features they’ll want. One option
is to start developing an entire full-featured first release of the product, with
every feature the founders can think of. We now know this results in wasted
engineering effort, time and cash, as customers don’t use, want or need most
of the features developed without their input.

Another path is to put Product Development on hold until the Customer
Development  team  can  find  customers  who  can  provide  adequate  feedback.
The risk here is lost time and no product for customers to provide feedback
against. A third, more productive approach is to develop the core features of
the  product  (incrementally  and  iteratively  with  agile  engineering  methods),
with  the  feature  list  driven  by  the  vision  and  experience  of  the  company’s
founders. This is a minimum viable product.

The  goal  of  customer  discovery  is  to  test  your  understanding  of  the
customer’s problem and see if your proposed solution will prompt him to use
or  buy  the  product  based  on  its  most  important  features  alone.  Most  users
want finished products, but earlyvangelists are the perfect target for the MVP.
Tailor the initial product release to satisfy their needs. If no one thinks your
MVP  solution  is  interesting  or  sufficient,  iterate  or  pivot  until  an  adequate
number say “yes.”

The shift in thinking to an incremental and iterative MVP as opposed to
a  fully  featured  first  product  release  is  important.  Engineers  tend  to  make  a
product  bigger  and  more  perfect.  The  MVP  helps  them  focus  the  most
important and indispensable features. Your goal in having an MVP is not to
gather feature requests to change the product or to make the feature set larger.
Instead, the goal is to put the MVP in front of customers to find out whether
you understood the customer problem well enough to define key elements of
the  solution.  Then  you  iteratively  refine  the  solution.  If,  and  only  if,  no

 
customers  can  be  found  for  the  most  important  features  of  the  MVP,  bring
customers’  additional  feature  requests  to  the  product  development  team.  In
the  Customer  Development  model,  feature  requests  to  an  MVP  are  by
exception and iteration rather than by rule. This eliminates the endless list of
feature  requests  that  often  delay  first  customer  ship  and  drive  product
development teams crazy.

 MVPs for Web/Mobile Are Different

Web/mobile businesses conduct customer discovery differently from those in
the physical channel. They can reach hundreds or thousands more customers
by  combining  online  and  face-to-face  interactions.  They  place  a  greater
emphasis  on  customer  acquisition,  activation,  and  referrals.  Web/mobile
minimum  viable  products  can  be  developed  faster  and  delivered  earlier,
accelerating  the  discovery  process.  When  delivered,  they  can  conduct  more
tests with customers, with more granular customer-response data. This results
in a faster iteration of the problem statement, the proposed solution, and the
MVP itself.

For web/mobile startups, here’s how the MVP is used in the discovery

process:

Developing the Minimum Viable Product for a Web/Mobile Product
(Figure 2.2)

Use the Business Model Canvas as The Customer
Discovery Scorecard

Often  there’s  a  lack  of  a  shared  and  clear  understanding  of  the  business
model throughout the company. This customer discovery step uses Alexander
Osterwalder’s  business  model  canvas  to  diagrammatically  illustrate  how  a
company  intends  to  make  money.  As  shown  in  Figure  2.3  the  canvas
represents any company in nine boxes, depicting the details of a company’s
product,  customers,  channels,  demand  creation,  revenue  models,  partners,
resources,  activities  and  cost  structure.  (We  described  the  business  model
canvas in detail in the Customer Development Manifesto.)

Business Model Canvas (Figure 2.3)

In this phase you’ll develop a one- or two-page brief about each of the

following boxes in the business model canvas:

Market Size: how big the opportunity is

Value Proposition, Part 1: the product/service, its benefits and minimum
viable product

Customer  Segments:  who  the  customer  is  and  what  problems  the
product solves

Channels: how the product will be distributed and sold

Customer Relationships: how demand will be created

Value  Proposition,  Part  2:  market-type  hypothesis  and  competitive  set/
differentiation

Key  Resources:  suppliers,  commodities,  or  other  essential  elements  of
the business

Key Partners: other enterprises essential to success of the business

Revenue Streams: revenue and profit sources and size

When  you  first  draft  your  initial  hypotheses  your  canvas  begins  to  fill

up, looking like Figure 2.4.

Sample Business Model Canvas—Initial Hypotheses (Figure 2.4)

But in addition to using the business model canvas as a static snapshot

of  the  business  at  a  single  moment,  frozen  in  time,  Customer  Development
uses the canvas as a “scorecard” to track progress in searching for a business
model.

Once  a  week  update  the  canvas  to  reflect  any  pivots  or  iterations,

highlighting in red the changes from the last week.

Then  after  you  and  your  team  agree  on  the  changes  to  your  business
model, integrate them into what becomes your new canvas for the week (the
accepted changes in red are then shown in black). During the next week any
new changes are again shown in red. Then the process repeats each week –
new changes showing up in red. Then a new canvas used for the week.

This  method  highlights  the  changes  over  time  for  your  and  the  team’s

reference. Figure 2.5 shows how the canvases will look over time.

Using the Business Model Canvas as a Weekly Scorecard (Figure 2.5)

Had  they  read  this  book,  and  gotten  out  of  the  building,  the  folks  at
Iridium might have saved billions by learning just how small the market for
their  business  had  become.  It  would  have  allowed  them  to  search  for
alternatives and survival.

there’s
To  sum  up  the  customer  discovery  philosophy:  whether 
product/market fit by finding earlyvangelists, understanding their needs, and
verifying  that  the  initial  minimum  viable  product  solves  a  problem  they’ll
eagerly  pay  to  have  solved.  And  if  not,  use  near-continuous  customer
feedback  to  drive  agile,  frequent  changes  in  product  and  business  model
alike.

As  you  complete  the  hypothesis  development,  your  business  model
canvas quickly becomes multi-dimensional. You are really developing three
initial canvases:

Core elements of the business model itself (value proposition, channel,
etc.)

Hypotheses  you  have  for  each  element  of  the  business  model  (such  as
“people  will  want  these  features,  “or  “customers  will  buy  our  product
because...”)

And a layer outlining the key pass/fail tests you will use to get face-to-
face with customers and use their feedback to convert your hypotheses
into facts.

Overview of Customer Discovery

Customer Discovery: Overview of the Process (Figure 2.6)

Customer Discovery has Four Phases

Phase 1 deconstructs the founders’ vision into the nine parts of the business
model  canvas  (product,  customers,  channels,  demand  creation,  revenue
models,  partners,  resources,  activities  and  cost  structure).  Then  your  team
writes  one-page  briefs  about  each  of  the  hypotheses,  including  the  list  of
experiments or tests you’ll need to conduct to prove or disprove each one.

In Phase 2 you conduct experiments to test your “problem” hypotheses. This
helps  you  understand  how  important  the  problem  is  and  how  big  it  can
become. You do so by testing most elements of the business model, including
the value proposition, pricing, channel strategy, and sales process. Your goal
is to turn hypotheses into facts or discard them if they’re wrong, and replace
them with new hypotheses. In the process, you’ll gain a deep understanding
of customers’ business, workflow, organization, and product needs. When all
the facts are in, update your results on the canvas.

 Web-based products and channels often implement much of Phase 2

online in near-real time.

In  Phase  3,  you  test  your  “solution,”  presenting  your  value  proposition
(product,  pricing,  features,  and  other  business  model  components)  and  the
minimum  viable  product  to  customers  and  compare  their  responses  to  the
“pass/fail”  goals  you  developed  earlier. 
  For  a  web-based  product,  the
MVP  is  a  live  site,  a  live  demo,  or  a  feature  or  piece  of  functionality  or
content.  The  goal  is  not  to  sell  the  product,  but  to  validate  how  well  you
understood  the  problem  in  Phase  2  when  you  heard  customers  say,  “Even
these  minimum  features  solve  our  problems,”  or,  “I  need  this  product.”
Ideally, customers ask, “When can I get it?”

  Online,  customers  should  engage  and  interact,  spend  time  on  it  or
with it, appear in droves, come back again and again, and bring their friends.

In  Phase  4  you  stop  and  assess  the  results  of  the  experiments  you’ve
conducted and verify that you have:

a full understanding of customers’ problems, passions, or needs

confirmed the value proposition solves problems, passions or needs

determined that a sizable volume of customers exists for the product

learned what customers will pay for the product

made certain the resulting revenue should deliver a profitable business

With  your  product  features  and  business  model  validated,  decide
whether  you  have  learned  enough  to  go  out  and  try  to  sell  a  select  your
product  to  a  few  visionary  customers,  or  whether  you  need  to  go  back  to
customers to learn some more. If, and only if, you are successful in this step
do you proceed to customer validation.

That’s  customer  discovery  in  a  nutshell.  The  remainder  of  this  section

details each of the phases just described.

Now let’s get started.

CHAPTER 3

Customer Discovery, Phase One: State
Your Business Model Hypotheses

THE  DIAGRAM  ABOVE  IS  AN  OVERVIEW  OF  PHASE  1  of  customer  discovery.
Note  that  hypotheses  for  physical  products  often  differ  from  web/mobile
products.  Where  the  hypothesis  issues  differ,  each  is  described  separately,
physical  startups  in  the  upper,  lighter-tinted  row  and  web/mobile  startup
considerations in the lower, darker row.

This phase starts by developing a rough market size estimate to size the
opportunity for your new venture. Next, the rest of customer discovery uses
the  business  model  canvas  to  record  short  summaries  (hypothesis briefs)  of
initial hypotheses about your business. The canvas provides a picture of the
business  model  on  a  single  page,  serving  as  a  reference  for  team  members
and  a  scorecard  keeping  track  of  pivots  and  iterations  as  the  company’s
business model changes.

The  hypothesis  briefs  provide  the  detail,  but  remain  short  and  to  the
point,  with  enough  clarity  to  ensure  that  all  team  members  understand  their
meaning. No hypothesis brief should be more than two pages, and as a rule,
bullet points are far more helpful than paragraphs or even sentences. Almost
every hypothesis concludes with the experiments you’ll use in phases 2 and
3, when you’re out of the building talking to customers to prove or disprove
the hypothesis. Sometimes you’ll even need to get out of the building to do
some research just to figure out what tests to conduct and the kinds of results
to shoot for.

Initially, some briefs may seem shockingly empty. Not to worry—these
briefs  serve  as  an  outline.  The  team  will  return  to  them  often,  filling  in  the
blanks  and  modifying  original  hypotheses  with  new  facts  learned  along  the
way.

Market Size Hypothesis

This  brief  is  an  outlier—it  doesn’t  directly  map  onto  the  business  model
canvas.  But  because  there’s  nothing  worse  than  spending  years  in  a  startup
only to discover that it can never grow to more than a few million dollars in
revenue,  the  market  size  hypotheses  help  you  size  the  opportunity  of  your
startup  market.  Estimating  market  size  helps  determine  whether  the  payoff
from your new venture is worth the toil, sweat and tears, or whether you’re
about to do your first pivot.

Aligning  investor  and  founder  objectives  clearly  at  the  outset  is  good
“life insurance” for founders, since few disconnects cost founders their jobs
more quickly than disputes over goals and gold.

...few disconnects cost founders their jobs more
quickly than disputes over goals and gold.

The  thinking  applies  regardless  of  whether  it’s  in  the  physical  or
web/mobile channel. With one exception: buyable startups founded for a fast
sale  to  a  larger-platform  player  like  Facebook  or  Google.  Buyable  startups
should consider the size of what ís often a microsegment of a large market.

Market opportunities are fueled by three ingredients: a large number of
potential active users or customers, clear future-user growth in a market with
rapid and predictable growth, and the opportunity to attract active customers
or users.

TAM, SAM and Target Market

Marketers and their investors typically think of market size as three numbers;
TAM  (total  addressable  market),  SAM  (served  available  market)  and  target
market. The TAM for makers of a new smartphone app might be the 1 billion

 
total smartphone owners worldwide, but if the application is available only in
English or works only on an iPhone, the SAM or potential market served is
far smaller. And the target market might be Apple App Store customers, so
your next step would be to estimate what percentage of those shoppers might
actually buy. Each estimate further narrows the target market.

TAM = how big is the universe
SAM = how many can I reach with my sales channel
Target Market (for a startup) = who will be the most likely buyers

TAM, SAM and Target Market (Figure 3.1)

Estimating TAM and SAM and target market is a good starting point for
the  market  size  hypothesis.  Customers  will  help  turn  these  hypotheses  into
facts.

A top-down estimate is a first step. Use industry-analyst reports, market-
research  reports,  competitors’  press  releases,  university  libraries—and
discussions  with  investors  and  customers  to  “size”  the  overall  market.  Use
whatever  metric  is  most  appropriate—units,  dollars,  page  views,  eyeballs,
whatever.

A  note  of  caution:  First-time  entrepreneurs  are  seduced  by  market  size
data  from  research  firms.  They  should  keep  in  mind  that  market  research
firms are excellent at predicting the past. (If they were geniuses at predicting
the future, they’d be running hedge funds.)

Therefore,  a  bottom-up  estimate  is  usually  more  realistic  for  startups.
Toy makers, for example do this quite easily: there are roughly 2 million girls
born in the U.S. each year, and half can’t afford a $90 doll, so the U.S. target
market for a new doll for girls age 6 to 8 is at most 3 million.

Market research firms are great at predicting the
past.

In assessing an existing or re-segmented market, be sure to consider the
adjacent markets that customers might switch from. Millions of BlackBerry
users traded in their RIM devices when Apple’s iPhone arrived, for example.
Will  the  startup’s  new  product  have  the  competitive  power  to  encourage
switching?  Count  only  the  switchable  subset  and  beware  of  long-term
contracts, service contracts, and “sunk costs” like training or installation, all
of which are often hidden barriers to switching.

Of  course,  nobody  can  compute  a  new  market’s  size  today,  since  it
doesn’t exist yet. What to do? Estimate the opportunity based on proxies and
adjacent  markets.  See  if  there  are  any  comparable  companies.  Have  others
grown as fast as the estimate? Why will this startup perform similarly?

 Sizing the web/mobile market

While some like to quote web/mobile market sizes in terms of eyeballs, page
views,  downloads,  referrals,  or  hours,  at  the  end  of  the  day  it’s  still  about
revenue.  What  confuses  new  entrepreneurs  is  that  web/mobile  markets  may
be multi-sided—the users (who may not pay) may be measured in eyeballs,
page  views,  downloads,  referrals,  or  hours,  but  there  had  better  be  payers
who offer dollars for access to those users.

For example, market size could be calculated by multiplying the number

of eyeballs by the dollars that each eyeball is worth to a payer.

Gathering  a  massive,  growing  audience  efficiently  and  cost-effectively
is  job  No.  1  for  most  web/mobile  products  (e-commerce  is  often  an
exception,  as  are  niche  vertical  sites).  This  is  the  time  to  develop  an  initial
hypothesis  about  where  that  audience  might  come  from  and  how  big  it  can
the
stage,  most  web/mobile 
become.  At 

startups 

follow 

this 

 
Google/Facebook/YouTube  strategy:  gather  a  (hopefully  massive)  audience
first and be sure it “sticks.” Monetize it later.

Gathering a massive, growing audience efficiently
and cost-effectively is job No. 1.

Calculating the audience without understanding who will pay money to
access  that  audience  is  a  mistake.  In  a  multi-sided  market,  you  need  to
estimate all sides of the market, particularly the side that will pay.

An easy way to gauge the “size” of a web market involves the free use
of  Google  tools.  Brainstorm  all  the  keywords  that  prospective  customers
might  use  to  find  your  product  or  site—“multiplayer  monster  games,”
“computer games with monsters,” “creatures and online games” and on and
on. The Google keyword tool summarizes how many people are searching for
each keyword. Make some allowances for overlap or duplication in a month
and  this  is  yet  another  way  to  develop  an  estimate  of  market  size.  It’s
especially effective at identifying whether you’re in a market that’s too small
to pursue—one where the total number of searches is measured in thousands,
for example.

Another  way  to  approach  the  market-sizing  question  is  the  “30/10/10”
law of web/mobile “physics,” first posited by leading venture capitalist Fred
Wilson.  Wilson  observed  that,  across  his  entire  portfolio  of  mobile  apps,
games, social and music services, this law applies consistently:

Thirty  percent  of  registered  users  and  those  downloading  mobile  apps
will use the service each month.

Ten percent of registered users and those downloading mobile apps will
use the service each day.

Concurrent users of a real-time service will seldom exceed 10 percent of
the number of daily users.

Industry  research  will  also  help  immensely  in  the  market-sizing
exercise.  Learn  how  to  research  your  market  in  Phase  2,  Customer
Understanding, which describes web-specific research tools and tactics.

Value Proposition 1: “Low Fidelity” MVP
Hypothesis

  The  MVP  brief  is  a  concise  summary  of  the  low  fidelity  web/mobile

features that will work as a stand-alone product.

The first two MVP steps—crafting the company’s long-term vision and
listing  the  product’s  features  and  benefits—are  virtually  identical  to  those
outlined in the following Physical MVP section, so they aren’t repeated here.
Review  those  steps  and  develop  those  hypothesis  statements  before  starting
here.

The low fidelity MVP tests whether you’ve
accurately identified a problem that customers care
about.

In  web/mobile  channels,  the  MVP  plays  an  even  more  important  role
than  it  does  in  the  physical  channel.  It  exposes  the  product  to  prospects  as
early  as  possible,  even  as  continuous  deployment  adds  new  features,
functionality  or  graphics.  A  low  fidelity  MVP  can  be  as  simple  as  a  single
web  page  used  to  gather  customer  feedback  about  the  problem  the  product
will  solve.  For  web-based  startups  using  agile  development  and  continuous
deployment, the delivery date for the low fidelity MVP is basically Day One.
Ideally, though, it’s a snapshot of the product as it exists on that day in the
agile  development  process,  in  its  “quick  and  dirty”  form,  even  though  that
form will evolve almost every day.

Even the earliest MVP versions should include some way for interested

 
users to register or self-identify, typically by leaving their e-mail addresses to
receive  updates.  These  early  users  will  be  helpful  throughout  the  customer
discovery process and beyond.

Web/Mobile channels will test both a low fidelity and a hi-fidelity MVP.
The  low-  and  hi-fidelity  MVPs  are  used  very  differently:  the  low  fidelity
MVP  tests  whether  you’ve  accurately  identified  a  problem  that  customers
care about (based on user visits to your site, e-mail received, demos played,
etc.),  while  the  hi-fidelity  MVP,  detailed  in  Phase 3,  will  later  test  whether
the  product  is  on  the  right  path  to  solving  that  problem  (based  on  orders
received,  users’  stays  on  the  site,  users’  recommendations  to  others,  etc.).
Later,  during  customer  validation,  when  the  hi-fidelity  MVP  is  exposed  to
many more customers, it should look and operate much more like a finished
product. Taken together, the low and high fidelity MVP tests help establish
product/market fit.

Write a User Story instead of a Feature List

A  “user  story”  is  important  in  web/mobile  channels,  where  intense
competition  and  millions  of  online  products  and  properties  often  make
product differentiation harder to “nail.” For example: There are thousands of
websites for nurses, and a user story can help explain the need for a new one.
Here’s  one:  Until  now,  operating-room  nurses  had  trouble  talking  to  one
another  about  their  stresses  and  “doctor  problems”  for  fear  of  spawning
gossip 
“ORNurse,”
“Nurseconfidential.net” allows these specialized nurses to:

of  HR.  Now 

the  wrath 

incurring 

or 

interact and chat anonymously with their peers nationwide and beyond

pose questions to fellow nurses in similar situations and collect a variety
of advice

obtain advice anonymously from legal, HR, and clinical professionals

send private messages to people they’d like to talk with personally

post anonymous comments about specific doctors, problems, or patient
situations

get a daily e-mail summary of what’s going on at the site

While this isn’t exactly a “feature list,” it provides a good sense of the
product vision, its features and benefits, and why the site will attract a hard-
to-reach audience.

Value Proposition Hypothesis (Part 1/Physical)

Start  this  step  by  filling  out  your  canvas  with  the  value  proposition
hypothesis: the product or service being offered to customers. You’ll include
details about the product, its features and benefits, as well as the company’s
long-term product vision and its initial minimum viable product. Think of the
value  proposition  as  a  contract  between  the  customer  and  your  company
where the customer “hires” your startup to solve a problem.

Write  a  series  of  briefs  that  capture  the  founders’  hours  of  thinking,
talking, and brainstorming about the product in three separate, specific areas:

Product Vision

Product Features & Benefits

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The product development team produces much of the product brief, one
of the few times it’s asked to engage in a paper exercise. They put key value
proposition hypotheses down on paper and turn them into briefs agreed to by
all executives..

Product Vision

This portion of the value proposition brief captures your vision for what you
want your successful company to become.

Over time, successful companies are usually more than a single product.
What’s  your  long-term  vision  for  your  company?  What  do  you  want  to

ultimately change? Are you going to do it with a series of products? How do
you  expand  into  adjacent  markets?  How  do  you  get  people  to  change
behavior?  What’s  the  world  look  like  three  years  after  you  arrive  on  the
scene? Five years after?

Shape a long-term vision with a short narrative told in bullet points. For
example in the 1990s, a financial software company might have described its
user story this way:

Consumers hate to reconcile their checkbooks

We  think  we  can  develop  a  computer  program  that  emulates  a
checkbook.

It will automate all the hard and tedious parts of home banking

Consumers can use it to pay bills by connecting to the Internet

Millions of people will start using home computers to do something they
never did before

Today small businesses use bookkeepers to keep their books

After we succeed in automating consumers we will expand into financial
software for small businesses

Millions of small businesses will start using computers to do something
they never did before

Suddenly, the company vision is clear with a few simple bullet points.
The vision is critical because the Customer Development team has to paint a
picture  for  earlyvangelists  of  what  the  product  will  look  like  a  year  or  two
into the future.

Only because earlyvangelists are buying into your
total vision will they spend money for an
incomplete, buggy, barely functional first product.

In the long-term vision, the product team specifies the delivery date for
the  MVP  and  for  follow-on  products  or  enhancements  to  the  product  as  far

 
out  as  the  team  can  see  (18  months  to  three  years).  In  startups,  this  request
usually elicits a response like, “How can I come up with future dates when
we barely know the first MVP delivery date?” Reassure your anxious product
development team that this first pass at a schedule isn’t set in stone.

Only because earlyvangelists are buying into your total vision will they
spend  money  for  an  incomplete,  buggy,  barely  functional  first  product. The
vision  should  convince  everyone  involved  that  this  is  an  opportunity  worth
the  investment  of  millions  of  dollars  and  years  of  work.  Ironically,  few
startups end up with products that look like their initial vision.

Finally, it’s never too early to think about strategic issues:

Will  it  create  network  effects?  A  single  fax  machine  was  useless  but
became more valuable as more people acquired them

Can  you  price  it  with  a  predictable  pricing  model—i.e.,  subscriptions
versus one-time sales?

Can  you  create  customer  lock-in/high  switching  costs?  Think  of  trying
to get your data from Facebook or from your doctor’s office

Can you have high gross margins?

Does it have organic demand versus marketing spend? Companies with
organic  demand  have  business  models  that  don’t  require  expensive
marketing. Think Google, eBay, Baidu, Skype, etc.

Product Features and Benefits

This portion of the value proposition brief captures what the product is and
why people will use or buy it.

While many engineers think new products are all about product features,
the product is just one of many elements of a successful startup. The product
features  list  is  a  one-page  document  consisting  of  one-  or  two-sentence
summaries of the top 10 (or fewer) features of the complete product vision.
(If  there’s  some  ambiguity  in  describing  a  particular  feature,  include  a
reference to a more detailed engineering document.)

Essentially,  the  feature  list  is  Product  Development’s  contract  with  the
rest  of  the  company.  The  biggest  challenge  will  be  deciding  what  features

will  ship  in  what  order.  Developing  the  MVP  will  start  the  prioritization
process. Once you get out of the building, customers will guide the process as
they begin interacting with the earliest version of the MVP.

Think  of  features  as  the  things  engineering  is  building,  and  think  of

benefits as the problem you’re solving for the customer.

Think of benefits as the problem you’re solving for
the customer.

Once  you  have  the  feature  list,  you  shape  a  product  benefits  list  by
describing  the  specific  product  benefits  as  seen  through  customers’  eyes.
(Something new? Something better? Faster? Cheaper?) Then develop a “user
story.” This short narrative explains what job the product will do. How will it
solve a problem that customers are eager to fix, or fulfill a need they have?
Ideally, the product solves a mission-critical problem, delivers a compelling,
exciting consumer benefit, or addresses an unspoken need. (Saves money or
time? Relieves a symptom? Fun, relaxing, faster? Better? Cheaper?) A bank-
software company might describe its user story this way:

Customers always face long lines at our bank on Fridays and on the first
and last days of the month when they come in to cash or deposit checks;
they get frustrated and often angry

We think we lose 5 percent to 8 percent of our customers as a result of
frustration

We  can  measure  lost  profits  of  about  $500,000  a  year,  significant
because it’s 7 percent of the total

This  $150,000  software  package  halves  the  time  it  takes  to  make  a
deposit and will be even faster in later versions

When 

thinking  about  product  features,  remember 

that  a  value
proposition  can  take  the  form  of  a  higher-performance  product  or  a  less
expensive  or  more  convenient  product.  It  can  address  a  market  niche  or
segment  or  solve  problems  in  a  new  or  different,  faster  or  cheaper  way.
Sometimes  the  product’s  physical  or  visual  design  or  even  the  brand  itself

 
may be different enough to command attention. Products don’t always solve
problems,  either.  While  most  business  products  do,  consumer  goods  more
often  serve  needs  in  areas  as  diverse  as  online  gaming,  social  networks,
fashion, and cars.

It’s  normal  for  marketers  to  want  to  describe  the  product  benefits,  but
it’s  likely  that  marketing  doesn’t  have  facts  about  customers  yet,  just
opinions. In a startup, the founders and Product Development are likely to be
the ones with the facts. So at this point, the marketing people would be wise
to  bite  their  tongues  and  listen  to  the  product  development  group’s
assumptions  about  the  features  and  exactly  how  they’ll  benefit  customers.
These  engineering-driven  benefits  represent  hypotheses  you’ll  test  against
real customer facts. In Phase 2, you’ll get out of the building to collect this
feedback directly from customers.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The  MVP  is  the  final  portion  of  this  first  value  proposition  brief.  It’s  a
concise summary of the smallest possible group of features that will work as
a  stand-alone  product  while  still  solving  at  least  the  “core”  problem  and
demonstrating the product’s value.

The MVP is:

a tactic for cutting back on wasted engineering hours

a  strategy  to  get  the  product  into  earlyvangelists  hands  as  soon  as
possible

a  tool  for  generating  maximum  customer  learning  in  the  shortest
possible time

Start  the  MVP  brief  by  defining  what  needs  to  be  learned—and  from
whom.  Customer  Development  efforts  will  engage  a  very  small  group  of
to  guide  product-feature
early  visionary  and  passionate  customers 
development until a profitable business model emerges. The sooner the MVP
is  in  their  hands,  the  sooner  feedback  can  arrive.  Rather  than  asking
customers  explicitly  about  feature  X,  Y  or  Z,  one  approach  to  defining  the
MVP  is  to  ask,  “What  is  the  smallest  or  least  complicated  problem  that  the

customer will pay us to solve?”

This approach runs counter to the typical cry for more features, which is
often  based  on  what  the  competitors  have  or  what  the  last  customer  visited
had to say. The MVP is the inverse of what most sales and marketing groups
ask of their development teams.

A goal of Customer Development is to understand
what not to ship.

Startups  tend  to  collect  a  list  of  features  that,  if  added  to  the  product,
would  get  just  that  one  additional  customer  to  buy.  Soon  a  10-page  feature
list evolves just to sell to 10 customers. That’s a plan for failure. The goal of
Customer  Development  is  not  to  collect  features  from  customers.  It’s  to
understand  what  not  to  ship.  The  perfect  feature  list  is  just  one  paragraph
long and can be sold to thousands or millions of customers. A core tenet of
the  Customer  Development  Manifesto  is  “less  is  more.”  Minimize  the
number  of  features  not  used  by  getting  a  MVP  into  customers’  hands  as
quickly  as  possible.  An  easy  guideline:  “no  new  features  until  you’ve
exhausted the search for a business model.”

 
Customer Segments: Source/Wiring Hypothesis

  When  you’re  done  with  this  brief,  you’ll  have  developed  a  customer
archetype and be able to say things like, “We believe most of our customers
are  age-18-to-25  tech-savvy  young  urban  professionals  who  use  Macs  and
spend  two  hours  a  day  on  Facebook”  or  “Twenty-five  percent  of  my
customers  read  Science  and  Nature  magazine  religiously  and  want  a  better
way  to  order  chemical  reagents  and  lab  supplies.”  And  you’ll  be  able  to
understand and draw a day in the life of a customer and draw a consumer web
influence map.

Start by reviewing the “customer segments/physical” hypotheses.

The Customer Archetype: a Guide to Who Your
Customers Are

A  customer  archetype  combines  everything  you  know  about  your  “most
typical”  customers  or  users  into  one  or  more  complete  profiles.  (Obviously
not  every  customer  will  look  like  this  homogenized  “average.”  In  fact,  you
more than likely will have several archetypes.)

Compile 

the  picture  by  gathering  statistics  about  customers’
demographics and behavior. (For help, see Customer Understanding in Phase
3.)  Use  Google  Trends,  Google  Insights,  and  Facebook  ads  to  look  at
web/mobile  customer  demographics.  Use  Crunchbase  to  look  at  who
competitors  are  selling  to.  Interview  people  you  think  look  most  like  your
potential customers and understand who they are, what they do, and how they
behave. Search online for studies, news articles, and reports about your target
consumers.  Study  competitors’  media  choices,  press  coverage  and  annual

reports. Most important, continue to update the archetype as you learn more
about customers over time.

A Guide to Using Customer/Archetypes to Drive Strategy (Figure 3.2)

Are your target customers or users big executives, networking nannies,
or teen gamers? Suburbanites or city dwellers? Single or married? Gather as
much  detail  as  possible.  How  old  are  they?  How  much  do  they  earn?  How
much  leisure  time  do  they  typically  have  and  how  much  spending  money?
Focus on their web/mobile-device ownership or access: desktop, laptop, iPad,
or smartphone—or all four? Are they loners or social-network heavyweights,
and  do  they  share  sites  and  information  generously  with  others?  When
they’re  online,  are  they  alone  at  home  or  in  a  crowd  at  school?  Use  the
detailed example in Figure 3.2 as a guide when developing yours.

“A Day-in-the-Life”: a Guide to What Customers
Do

How much time do your customers spend online in a typical 24-hour day? Is
it  at  their  desk,  on  a  laptop,  or  on  a  handheld  while  driving?  Your  success
depends  on  becoming  a  regular  part  of  the  customer’s  day,  whether  for
information, social networking, play, or e-commerce. But what’s the source
of  the  “newfound”  time  they’ll  spend  on  your  new  site  or  using  your  new
app? Will they sleep less? Will they spend less time on Facebook or eBay?
Will they spend less time goofing off at work to spend time at the new site?

What’s the source of the “newfound” time they’ll
spend on your new site or using your new app?

Be sure to understand how they find out about new products. Are they
religious readers of TechCrunch or People, game-review sites or news feeds?
Do they Tweet often, and do they read Tweets from two people or 50? Text
twice  or  100  times  a  day,  and  to  whom?  Where  do  they  go  for  information
about products in general and products like yours, and how often and for how
long?

Where  will  you  find  your  customers?  On  the  web,  your  customers  can
be anywhere: at niche websites, reading blogs, on Facebook and other social
networks, or on social news sites. The could be Tweeting or reading Tweets,
texting or engaging with other similar customers on forums, wikis, and more.

A Guide to Using A Day-in-the-Life to Drive Strategy (Figure 3.3)

Create  a  “day  in  the  life”  scenario  using  15-  or  30-minute  increments
from wakeup to bedtime, paying close attention to time spent on web/mobile
devices, specifying not only which device but what your customer is actually
doing  on  the  device  and  for  how  long:  texting  with  friends,  reading  blogs
(note  which  ones),  playing  mobile  or  social  games  (note  which  ones),
shopping for shoes (note where), or posting pictures of her cat on Facebook?
Use  the  detailed  example  in  Figure  3.3  as  a  guide  when  developing

yours.

Summarize the archetype and day-in-a-life in a tight bullet-point format.

 
Use  those  bullets  to  evaluate  the  potential  value  of  activities  you’ll  use  to
“get”  customers  when  developing  the  upcoming  Customer  Relationships
hypothesis.  Figures  3.2  and  3.3  offer  an  example  for  a  company  selling
downloadable gourmet-cooking lessons targeting working couples who cook
together, and try to do it creatively.

When  the  customer  archetype  and  “day  in  the  life”  are  complete,  you
now know what your customers look like, what they do with their days, and
how to find them.

This example illustrates how the archetype and “day in the life” efforts
can  focus  “customer  acquisition”  activity.  While  there’s  no  such  thing  as
perfect targeting in mass-marketing efforts, fine-tuning every “get customers”
activity  to  “fish  where  the  fish  are”  helps  maximize  the  return  on  every
customer-relationships dollar you’ll spend.

Here’s How to Create a Consumer Web Influence Map:

In the web/mobile world, influence maps are as daunting and complex as they
are  influential.  Think  of  the  number  of  ways  a  consumer  can  be  influenced
online, and how your efforts can also influence the influentials themselves as
part  of  the  marketing  process.  “Dots”  on  the  online  influence  map  include
blogs  and  chat  rooms,  authoritative  websites,  social  networks,  pundits,  and
referral  or  reference  sites.  In  addition  to  delivering  direct  exposure,  these
influencers are often significant sources of “natural search” clicks that bring
people to the website.

Consumer Web Influence Map (Figure 3.4)

Finally,  recognize  that  in  web/mobile  apps,  you  may  have  multiple
customer segments in a multi-sided market. In this case, “customers” can be
users who may pay nothing for the product or service but provide a value to
the supplier that it can resell to others. Google is the canonical “multi-sided”
example:  billions  of  “customers”  search  at  Google  for  free,  and  millions  of
advertisers pay to reach them. Most social-network and content sites operate
this way.

startups, are invaluable to web/mobile startups as well.

Customer Segments: Who/Problem Hypothesis
(Physical)

This  brief  describes  who  the  customers  are  (the  customer  types)  and  what
problems, needs or passions they have. It includes five components:

customer problems, needs or passions

customer types

customer archetypes

a day in the life of customer

organizational map and customer influence map

The Customer Problem, Need or Passion

Products are sold because they solve a problem or fill a need. (See the bank
teller  story  in  Value  Proposition.)  Understanding  problems  and  needs
involves understanding their sources. Get out of the building to discover how
customers  experience  the  problem  and  why  (and  how  much)  it  matters  to
them.  Understand  the  organizational  impact  problem,  and  the  intensity  of
pain  it  causes  the  company/family/consumer.  Use  a  simple  “problem
recognition  scale”  for  each  important  type  of  customer  (Figure  3.5).
Customers will express:

a latent problem: they have a problem but don’t know it

a passive  problem:  they  know  of  the  problem  but  aren’t  motivated  or
aware of the opportunity to change

an active (or urgent) problem: they recognize a problem or passion and
are searching for a solution but haven’t done any serious work to solve
the problem

a  vision:  they  have  an  idea  for  solving  the  problem  and  even  have
cobbled  together  a  home-grown  solution,  but  are  prepared  to  pay  for  a
better one

Study the problem. Is your product solving a mission-critical company
problem  or  satisfying  a  must-have  consumer  need?  Is  your  product  a  must-
have  or  a  nice-to-have?  When  your  product  solves  a  problem  that  costs
customers  sleep,  revenue,  or  profits,  things  are  definitely  looking  up.  When
it’s  the  hottest  “new  new  thing”  in  town,  whether  that  town  is  physical  or
virtual,  capitalize  on  the  opportunity.  The  best  startups  discover  a  situation
where  customers  have 
themselves—they
simultaneously  discover  both  a  mission-critical  problem  and  a  customer-
visualized  solution.  Wow.  Now  simply  convince  the  customer  that  if  they
build  it  themselves,  they’re  detouring  into  a  different,  usually  non-core
business—your new business!

to  build  a  solution 

tried 

The best startups discover a situation where
customers have tried to build a solution themselves.

Then  again,  not  every  product  solves  problems.  Some  provide  fun  or
information,  others  glamour  or  romance.  Social  networks  don’t  solve
problems  but  sure  have  millions  of  visitors—they  fill  consumer  needs  and
desires.  Even  if  it’s  fun  or  pure  luxury,  recognize  that  consumers  require
justification for a purchase.

After  identifying  the  customer  types,  craft  a  hypothesis  about  their
emotional wants and desires. Describe how to convince these customers that
the  product  can  deliver  an  emotional  payoff:  glamour,  beauty,  wealth,
prestige, a hot date or lost pounds.

 
Customer Types

Whether a customer is spending time on a social network, buying a stick of
gum, or purchasing a million-dollar telecom system, every sale involves a set
of  decision-makers.  Thus  customer  analysis  starts  with  an  understanding  of
what types of customers to approach. Chances are several people in a number
of  categories  have  problems  that  your  product  can  solve  or  needs  or
ambitions that it can satisfy. Customer discovery identifies and probes these
different needs. Customer types include:

End Users:  The  day-to-day  users  of  a  product  push  the  buttons,  touch  the
product, use it, love it, and hate it. A deep understanding of their needs and
motivations  is  vital,  recognizing  that  the  end  user  may  often  have  the  least
influence in the sales or adoption process. This is typically true in complex
corporate sales.

Customer Types (Figure 3.5)

Influencers:  At  times,  the  most  powerful  pressure  on  a  customer’s  buying
decisions may not be something the startup did directly but something done
or  said  by  someone  who’s  uninvolved.  In  every  market  or  industry,  online
and off, a select group of individuals pioneers the trends, styles and opinions.
Ask a famous dress designer when a movie star wears her dress to the Oscars.

Or consider the effect of thousands of people clicking their Facebook “like”
button or Tweeting about a product, ad or service. Sometimes the influencers
are paid bloggers or pundits in market-research firms. They may be kids or
celebrities  who  wear  the  latest  fashions.  Include  the  target  list  of  outside
influencers  and  address  how  they’ll  be  reached.  Free  product,  payments,
celebrity events, free computers and online memberships are among the many
options.

Recommenders:  They 
influence  purchase  decisions  but  differ  from
influencers because their opinions can make or break a sale. A recommender
could be a widely read blogger raving about a new online game, a department
head  saying  any  new  PCs  should  come  from  Dell,  a  hospital  committee
approving a new medical device, or a spouse with a particularly strong brand
preference.  It  can  also  be  an  external  force  like  Gartner  Group,  Forrester
Research, Martha Stewart or Consumer Reports.

Economic buyers: They sit further up the decision chain and often control or
approve  the  purchase  or  budget.  (Important  people  to  know!)  They  can  be
corporate  VPs,  office  managers, 
issuing
reimbursement  codes,  teens  with  allowances,  or  spouses  with  vacation
budgets.

insurance  companies  with 

Decision-makers:  They  may  be  the  economic  buyers  or  reside  even  higher
up  in  the  decision-making  hierarchy.  Decision-makers  wield  the  ultimate
purchase  authority  and  are  sometimes  called  UDMs  (ultimate  decision-
makers) or VITOs (very important top officers) or perhaps “Mom,” “Dad” or
“honey.” Be sure to understand their motivations.

Saboteurs:  They  can  lurk  anywhere  (as  saboteurs  do)  and  hold  titles
including CFO, CIO, child, spouse, or purchasing agent with “friends.” They
can be found in strategic planning departments or in your own home, where
their  veto  can  slow  things  dramatically.  Find  them.  Identify  patterns  that
reveal where they’re hiding in the decision process.

Later, during customer validation, knowing all the players in detail will
be  essential.  For  now,  simply  recognize  that  the  customer  is  more
complicated than a single individual.

Customer Archetypes

Remember  the  axiom  “A  picture  is  worth  a  thousand  words”?  There’s  no
better way for the startup team to visualize its customer targets than to take
the  time  to  depict  each  of  the  key  customer  types—the  end  user  and  the
decision-maker  at  a  minimum  (at  least  make  a  few  sketches  or  doodles).
Customer archetypes help the team visualize who will buy or use the product
and helps crystallize product strategy, customer acquisition, and more.

Customer Archetype (Figure 3.6)

In  a  business-to-business  sale,  does  the  end  user  work  in  an  office,  a
cubicle  or  a  boiler  room?  Is  he  or  she  a  business  traveler,  a  presenter,  or  a
heads-down number cruncher? Is the decision-maker in a corner office, is she
a  scientist  in  a  research  lab  with  a  wall  lined  with  prestigious  degrees  and
awards, or is she on the factory floor?

To  understand  more  about  customer  archetypes  and  how  they’re  used,
review  a  detailed  discussion  in  the  next  section,  “Customers/Source—

Web/Mobile.”  Once  you’ve  read  that,  create  a  comprehensive  view  of  each
key customer archetype, using the data you collected.

Consumer  archetypes  are  generally  easier  to  create  than  business-to-
business,  where  relationships  are  far  more  complex.  Identify  as  many
hypotheses  about  the  buyer’s  demographic  and  psychographic  profile  as
possible.  Is  the  buyer  affluent,  fashion-conscious,  healthy  and  active?
Married with pets and toddlers or teens? In a house, an apartment, or a trailer
park?  These  characteristics  will  influence  many  aspects  of  the  business
model, including customer relationships, channel, and revenue model.

A Day in the Life of a Customer

One  of  the  most  powerful  ways  to  understand  your  customers,  whether
they’re consumer or business customers, is to discover how they “work” and
write it down, delineating a day in their life.

...discover how customers “work” and write it
down, delineating a day in their life.

In  the  case  of  businesses,  this  step  requires  a  deep  understanding  of  a
target  company  on  many  levels.  Let’s  use  selling  software  to  a  bank  as  an
example.  How  a  bank  works  isn’t  something  you’ll  discover  by  cashing  a
check. You want to know how the world looks from a banker’s perspective.
To  begin  with,  how  do  the  potential  end  users  of  the  product  (the  tellers)
spend their days? What products do they use? How much time do they spend
using  them?  How  would  life  change  for  these  users  after  they  have  your
product? Unless you’ve been a bank teller, these questions should leave you
feeling somewhat at a loss, but how are you going to sell a product to a bank
to solve tellers’ problems if you don’t understand how they work?

(If  you’re  not  an  experienced  salesperson,  this  whole  notion  of  getting
out  of  the  building  can  sound  intimidating.  The  “Get  Out  of  the  Building”
section of customer discovery, Chapter 4, describes how to set up your first
meetings.)

Now run this exercise from the perspective of branch managers. How do
they  spend  their  day?  How  would  your  new  product  affect  them?  Run  it

 
again,  this  time  thinking  about  bank  presidents.  What  on  earth  do  they  do?
What do they read? Who influences their decisions? How will your product
affect her? And if you’re installing a product that connects to other software
the bank has, you’re going to have deal with the IT organization. How do the
IT people spend their day? What other software do they run? How are their
existing  systems  configured?  Who  are  their  preferred  vendors?  Are  they
standing  at  the  door  with  confetti  and  Champagne  waiting  to  welcome  yet
another new company with yet another product?

The answers are easy. Asking the right questions is
hard.

Business products are generally purchased because they solve problems,
so a deep understanding of the buyer is required. If you’re selling a retailer
point-of-sale  tools,  for  example,  can  someone  on  your  team  work  behind  a
busy counter for a few days? There’s no better way to understand than to dive
in. Learn how prospective users currently solve their problems, online or off,
and how they’d do it differently using the new product. What will motivate
these customers to buy? Draw a vivid and specific picture of a day in the life
of  the  customer,  and  do  the  research  in  the  same  place  where  they  do  their
work  or  have  their  fun,  not  in  the  company  conference  room  or  alone  at  a
local Starbucks.

Finally, back to our banking example, do you know about trends in the
banking industry? Is there a banking-industry software consortium? Are there
bank  software  trade  shows?  Industry  analysts?  Unless  you’ve  come  from
your  target  industry,  this  part  of  your  customer-problem  brief  may  include
little more than lots of question marks. That’s OK. In customer development,
the answers turn out to be easy; it’s asking the right questions that’s difficult.
You’ll be going out and talking to customers with the goal of filling in all the
blank spots on the customer-problem brief.

For  a  consumer  product,  the  same  exercise  is  applicable.  How  do
consumers solve their problems today? How would they solve their problems
with  your  product?  Would  they  be  happier?  Smarter?  Feel  better?  Do  you
understand what will motivate these customers to buy?

Your  final  exam  doesn’t  happen  until  you  come  back  to  the  company

 
and, in meetings with the product development team and your peers, draw a
vivid and specific picture of a day in the life of your customer.

A Sample Organizational/Influence Map (Figure 3.7)

Organizational/Influence Maps

Now having a deeper understanding of a customer’s typical day, you realize
that  except  in  rare  cases,  most  customers  don’t  work  by  themselves.
Consumers  interact  with  friends  and  family,  while  businesspeople  interact
with  their  colleagues.  List  the  people  who  could  influence  a  customer’s
buying  decisions  and  draw  a  tentative  diagram  of  the  prospective  customer
and  all  the  influences  surrounding  him  or  her.  Also  depict  the  product’s
impact on their day-to-day work or personal life. Then build a map showing
potentially influential people who surround the user. At a large company, the
diagram will be complex, with lots of initial unknowns.

Channels Hypothesis

  The  distribution-channel  brief  describes  how  a  web/mobile  product  gets

from company to customers.

Begin  this  hypothesis  development  by  reading  the  introduction  to  the
physical channel section, just prior to this one. It addresses general channel
strategy and costs of various channels and how they affect revenue.

Web/mobile channels can reach billions of wired people worldwide via
computer,  tablet,  or  handheld  device.  These  channels  are  “always  on,”  and
never  sleep,  often  literally  in  the  palm  of  a  consumer’s  hand  and  usually
within arm’s reach 24 hours a day. The reach, persistence and accessibility of
the mobile channel has only just begun to affect the way people live, work,
buy, and do.

A storefront or service solution accessible to literally billions of people
every single minute of every day is a marketer’s dream. Web/mobile products
can be built quickly and enable a near-instant presence at potentially minimal
cost—as little as $5 a month for a small online Yahoo store, for example. The
company  retains  complete  control,  keeps  nearly  100  percent  of  the  revenue
from  its  direct  sales,  and  can  change  pricing,  promotion  and  more  in  mere
moments.

But the downside of this is that no customers “walk by” the website, and
the burden and cost of generating awareness, traffic, and sales falls entirely
on  the  company.  (This  is  discussed  in  greater  detail  later  in  the  customer
relationship hypothesis.) Whether it’s a website run by the company itself or
Amazon.com  or  Apple’s  App  Store,  success  in  the  web/mobile  channel  is
almost  entirely  dependent  on  creating  demand,  attracting  visitors  to  the  site
cost-effectively, and persuading them to engage with the product or buy it.

Web/Mobile Distribution Channel Choices (Figure 3.8)

Web/Mobile Channel Choices

Much like the physical distribution channel, each web/mobile channel has its
strengths,  weaknesses,  and  costs.  (Increasingly,  physical  products  are  sold
both online and in a physical channel.) As a startup you should pick the one
distribution  channel  that  provides  the  optimum  balance  between  the
company’s  value  proposition,  its  costs  and  revenue  model,  and  how
customers prefer to buy. (You can add additional channels as you scale and
grow.)

Pick one distribution channel. You can add
additional channels as you scale and grow.

Dedicated e-commerce:  Your  company  offers  its  products  for  sale  directly
on  your  own  “dedicated”  e-commerce  website  (which  can  be  hosted
anywhere). Customers access the site via a web browser. Whether the product
is  physical  or  web/mobile,  consumers  and  businesses  can  learn  details,  see
products, compare features, and complete the transaction at the single URL.

     Strengths: Basic sites are easy to create, and deliver complete control of

price, product presentation, inventory and more.

     Weaknesses: Company must bear all challenges and costs of traffic-

building and converting visitors to buyers.

Two-step e-distribution:  This  is  how  your  company  can  reach  many  more
customers by simultaneously selling your products on e-commerce sites that
help  generate  awareness  and  demand.  It  is  the  most  common  web/mobile
channel,  encompassing  every  conceivable  retailer  from  Amazon.com
BestBuy.com, the Android and Apple app stores to small e-commerce sites.
Distribution  costs  vary,  with  Amazon.com  at  the  high  end,  charging  55
percent  of  retail  prices  to  sell  a  physical  book.  For  that  hefty  sum,  this
channel  maintains  inventory,  packs  and  ships  the  goods,  and  collects
payment. As a rule, the more the retailer does to generate consumer demand,
the more it earns for making the sale.

     Strengths: Fastest way to get national distribution at a variable cost with

little upfront spending.

     Weaknesses: Little control of on-site promotion or product visibility,

except with extra spending.

Aggregators: The online equivalent of a physical shopping mall, usually in a
single  category.  They  aggregate  consumers  with  common  areas  of  interest
and  direct  them  through  a  web/mobile  supermarket  of  products.  Customers
access  the  site  via  a  web  browser.  Hundreds  of  mortgages  and  related
financial  products  are  available 
through  LendingTree.com,  while
cloudshowplace.com provides a buyer’s guide to hundreds of SAAS software

 
tools, many of which can be purchased with a few clicks on the showplace.
Diapers.com and Zappos (both owned by Amazon) aggregate baby and shoe
products, respectively, from hundreds of manufacturers. Online trade shows
for  business-to-business  products  work  in  a  similar  way,  creating  the  look
and feel of a typical trade show and selling booths to marketers who provide
demonstrations,  white  papers,  and  literature  and  can  take  orders  in  their
virtual “booths.”

     Strengths: Fast way to get national distribution at a variable cost with little

upfront spending.

     Weaknesses: Hard to get visibility, on-site promotion and marketing; can

be very costly.

Platforms that Operate as Channels

Mobile-app  commerce:  A  web/mobile  application  distribution  platform
behaves in many ways just like a physical channel’s retail stores. Mobile apps
and  many  web  apps  and  games  are  sold  on  web/mobile  platforms.  For
example,  Zynga’s  Farmville  and  other  online  games  use  Facebook,  with
hundreds of millions of users, as a “platform.” Facebook offers its platform to
thousands of other companies, turning its social network into a sales channel.
Apple and Google’s Android offer app stores that allow mobile users to buy
everything  from  games  to  expense-account  software  for  their  iPhone  or
Android phones.

Dedicated marketplaces like the iPhone app store or the Android are the
primary  “platform-as-channel”  marketplace  for  smartphone  app.  The  Apple
App  Store  charges  30  percent  of  retail  pricing  for  downloadable  iPhone
applications.  Smartphone  apps  dominated  sales  in  this  channel,  but
salesforce.com opened its AppExchange for business-to-business applications
and other companies will follow.

     Strengths: Massive reach in a fast-growing channel for games, software,
shopping applications and more. It’s a channel that’s “always on” and
quite handy (for literally many millions of consumers). This is an
explosive business opportunity.

     Weaknesses: Costly intermediaries, file-size constraints, product-

presentation and payment challenges, operational complexity, extremely

difficult to get consumers’ attention or promote app or its marketing
messages.

Social commerce:  Social  networks  like  Facebook  and  Twitter  have  moved
quickly  to  turn  their  platforms  into  commerce  to  monetize  their  vast
audiences.  Customers  access  the  site  via  a  browser  or  dedicated  app.
Web/mobile  currency  and  items  for  enhanced  online  gaming  are  already
maturing,  with  many  more  vertical  markets  following  in  its  lucrative
footsteps.

     Strengths: Fast, potentially massive distribution; great for product

launches, awareness-building, and fast cash.

     Weaknesses: Hard to create awareness and draw attention. Platforms take

50 percent or more as a cost of sales.

Flash sales: Flash sales offer a list of consumers deep discounts on branded
merchandise with offers expiring in 24 or 48 hours. Gilt.com, Groupon and
scores  of  clones  assemble  massive  e-mail  and  social  networking  lists  of
consumers  eager  to  obtain  product  discounts  in  specific  categories  or
geographies. These social-commerce sites deliver the revenue and a volume
of customers.

Flash sales can generate massive red ink in a hurry.

     Strengths: Fast, potentially massive distribution; great for product

launches, awareness-building, and fast cash.

     Weaknesses: Often painfully expensive. End users often expect 50 percent
discounts from retail price; manufacturer then pays 50 percent of its 50
percent sales price to the social-commerce site. Can generate massive red
ink in a hurry.

Free-to-paid channel:  While  it’s  hard  to  say  whether  this  is  a  platform,  a
channel, or a demand-creation strategy, it’s an increasingly powerful way to
create  customer 
relationships,  particularly  among  companies  with
web/mobile  products  that  require  little  or  no  customization.  A  few  fast-
growing companies such as Zynga have used social networking to create vast

 
audiences of free users of games like Farmville and MafiaWars. They provide
a  certain  amount  of  game  play  for  free—sometimes  even  all  of  it—but  sell
lots  of  web/mobile  goods  for  real  cash  as  they  “hook”  their  users  on  the
game.

If they don’t convert and pay, you’re dead.

Other  game  companies  offer  free,  limited  versions  widely  or  full
versions for a limited time (“seven-day free trial with your credit card”) only
to aggressively upsell free users to a more elaborate paid version. Recently,
online  tax-software  companies  have  begun  offering  free  federal-tax-return
preparation online for simple tax returns, only to create a channel from which
they can upsell people with more complex returns to prepare or charge them
for state and municipal returns.

     Strengths: Accelerates trial and adoption at relatively low cost. Terrific as

a launch strategy.

     Weaknesses: Free-to-pay is sexy but dangerous. You can get tons of users
fast, but if they don’t convert and pay, you’re dead. Mapping profitable
conversion of free to paid users makes or breaks the company.

Tests Can Help You Pick the Channel

For some products, the channel choice is obvious. There’s one channel for an
iPhone  or  iPad  app,  and  another  equally  obvious  channel  for  social  games.
Many  products,  however,  will  need  to  test  both  the  cost-effectiveness  and
volume potential of several channels to determine where to put their energy,
focus,  and  marketing  dollars.  A  simple  downloadable  app,  for  example,
might  simultaneously  test  as  many  as  three  channels:  an  app  store,  the
freemium model, and online retail. Design the test to spend roughly the same
amount of money on each one, and—at a bare minimum—look to generate at
least $2 in revenue if not more for every dollar spent on marketing (you can
always improve it later). Then see which program delivers customers at the
lowest cost per customer, and which delivers the greatest absolute number of
customers.

 
Multi-Sided Markets Need Unique Channel Plans

At about the same time a physical channel company begins thinking about its
sales channels, startups in multi-sided web/mobile markets should develop a
hypothesis about their “other” side or, in this case, the “revenue channel.”

Most multi-sided revenue channels function quite simply: they attract a
large number of users and advertisers pay to reach them via textlinks, banner
ads,  in-game  visibility  or  traditional  online  advertising.  So  the  goal  now  is
relatively  straightforward,  identify  potential  advertisers  or  agencies,  and
estimate how much they’re willing to pay, how the sales process works, and
whether  the  hypotheses  about  the  revenue  “side”  of  the  market  is  valid.
Beware  the  two  deadliest  advertising-related  problems  for  multi-sided
marketers: small and indistinct audiences.

The more distinct the audience—and the harder it
is to aggregate—the more valuable it will be.

     Small audiences: Advertising agencies like to spend big piles of their

client’s money with as few insertion orders (the advertising equivalent of
a purchase order) as possible, and they want to reach massive numbers of
people with each one. Getting an insertion order or even the opportunity
to make a sales pitch to an advertising agency generally requires monthly
page views in the many millions. Make sure the “payer” channel’s
potential is clear as part of the channel validation process.

     Indistinct audiences: The online advertising world is so littered with

unsold inventory that many advertisers buy huge volumes of banners,
skyscrapers and textlinks through online advertising “networks” that
aggregate dozens or hundreds of sites appealing to a specific group, such
as teenagers. They collect all the unsold inventory at a very low,
distressed price and roll it into one package that often includes hundreds
of millions of impressions for one or several advertisers.

     The more distinct the audience—and the harder it is to aggregate—the
more valuable it will be. “Working mothers” and “generation Y”

 
consumers can be aggregated easily, for example, while very frequent
fliers or luxury-car owners are harder to aggregate. Other high-value
audiences: orthodontists, owners or renters of private aircraft, gamers
who spend more than $100 a month on gaming, and high-roller casino
gamblers. The more distinctive a group, the more a multi-sided market
can charge the “other side” to reach the group with ads.

Note  to  reader:  These  following  guidelines,  geared  for  physical  channel
startups, are invaluable to web/mobile startups as well.

Channels Hypothesis (Physical)

The  channel  brief  describes  how  the  product  gets  from  company  to
customers.

The  difference  between  physical  and  web/mobile  channels  is  dramatic.
In  one,  physical  goods  move  from  a  loading  dock  to  a  customer  or  a  retail
outlet.  In  another,  no  human  involvement  is  required,  as  the  product  is
offered  and  sold  online.  (If  the  product  itself  is  bits,  it’s  both  sold  and
delivered online.)

Physical  channels  have  been  around  for  centuries.  They’re  an
“intermediate customer” the startup has to deal with, and the barriers can be
significant: high cost, long lead times, lack of control, and lack of promotion,
to  name  a  few.  However,  the  rewards  can  be  great.  In  the  20th  century,
physical  distribution  was  especially  important.  Back  then,  the  pinnacle  of
distribution  was  to  be  sold  at  Walmart,  which  welcomes  20  million
Americans every day.

Consider whether your product fits the channel.

Most companies use both web/mobile and physical channels today. For
example,  even  with  some  10,000  massive  physical  stores,  Walmart  also
invests  heavily  in  walmart.com,  an  alternate  channel,  as  most  national
retailers  do.  Most  channel  strategies,  particularly  for  physical  goods,  today
involve both physical and web/mobile channels. Whether a company uses a
physical or web channel, it must generate customer demand and drive it into

 
the sales channel. Physical and web channels employ very different demand-
creation activities.

Consider Whether Your Product “Fits” the
Channel

Different sales channels support different product price bands. For example, a
salesperson  selling  enterprise  software  needs  to  bring  in  more  than  $1.5
million  in  annual  revenue.  On  the  other  hand,  few  Smartphone  applications
sell for more than $10, minus the typical 30 percent app-store fee. Other e-
tailers such as Amazon and bestbuy.com regularly sell products for hundreds
if  not  thousands  of  dollars,  sometimes  keeping  as  much  as  half  the  gross
revenue for themselves.

Be  sure  to  factor  all  channel  costs  into  the  pricing  hypothesis,  since
many  channels  charge  for  distribution,  promotion,  and  even  sometimes  for
placing  products  on  the  shelves  or  returning  unsold  merchandise  to  the
company.  Channel  selection  changes  the  company’s  revenue  model,  often
dramatically, so be sure to revisit and update the revenue stream hypothesis
based  on  the  company’s  costs  and  net  revenue  when  making  the  channel
selection.  (Always  compute  the  revenue  stream  on  a  “net”  basis,  reflecting
only revenue that will arrive in company coffers once the dust settles.)

Which Channel Should I Use?

A  tragic  mistake  many  startups  make  is  to  overreach  on  initial  channel
efforts.  Until  the  company  completes  customer  validation,  it  should  pick  a
sales  channel  representing  the  greatest  potential  and  focus  on  it  to  the
exclusion  of  all  others.  Your  company  is  still  testing  and  expanding  its
hypotheses and needs to focus on learning. Don’t try to launch a product via
direct sales, chain stores and direct mail all at once—it’s almost impossible to
succeed at all three. The big exception, of course: physical-channel launches
with simultaneous web-marketing (and sometimes sales) support.

Decisions  about  channel  and  pricing  are  interrelated,  so  develop  the
channel hypothesis while working simultaneously on the revenue and pricing
hypothesis.  For  example,  retail  distribution  cuts  the  company’s  revenue
dramatically while direct sales may deliver more sales dollars but do so more

slowly.  When  considering  which  channels  to  adopt,  keep  these  criteria  in
mind:

Are there established buying habits/practices in the product category?

Does  the  channel  strengthen  the  sales  process?  At  what  cost  to  the
company?

What  are  the  price  and  complexity  issues  surrounding  sale  of  the
product?

Startups  seldom  get  the  channel  strategy  right  the  first  time.  Most
technology startups, for example, assume that a direct sales force is the way
to go, a hypothesis that’s often proved wrong. It’s almost always smartest—
and  safest—to  first  observe  existing  buying  patterns  and  habits  for  similar
products  and  product  categories,  since  customers  are  demonstrating  their
preferred channel by spending their money there.

Value Proposition 2: Market-Type and Competitive
Hypothesis

The market-type brief describes which of the four market types the company
fits  into.  (Refer  to  Chapter  1,  Rule  7,  in  the  Customer  Development
Manifesto.) It also adds a competitive brief.

Regardless of the channel they choose, startups adopt (or pursue) one of
four market types. The consequences of choosing the wrong market type are
severe (prematurely burning cash on marketing and sales before it’s needed),
but unlike decisions about product features, the market-type choice is a “late-
binding”  decision.  While  a  final  decision  can  be  deferred  until  customer
creation, it’s wise to develop and test an initial market-type hypothesis while
moving  through  the  customer  discovery  phase.  In  the  next  chapters,  we’ll
come back to the market type selection process many times, and refine and
deepen the analysis after further discussing customers and market.

In  this  brief,  seek  a  provisional  answer  to  just  one  question:  is  the
company  entering  an  existing  market,  re-segmenting  an  existing  market,
creating a new market or cloning a market?

Market type drives marketing spending, sales
timing and cash need.

Market Type

For  some  startups,  the  market-type  choice  is  pretty  clear.  When  entering  a
market  that  has  a  ton  of  competitors,  whether  it’s  smartphones,  social

 
networks, glucose meters or airplanes, the choice has already been made for
you:  it’s  an  existing  market.  On  the  other  hand,  if  your  company  invents  a
new class of product no one has ever seen before, it’s most likely in a new
market. However, most companies have the luxury of choosing which market
type to use. So how to make the decision? A few simple questions begin the
process:

Is  there  an  established,  well-defined  market  with  large  numbers  of
customers?  Do  customers  know  the  name  of  the  market  and  do
competitors exist? Does the product have an edge (better performance,
features, service) over competitors? If so, it’s an existing market

Would  some  part  of  an  existing  market  buy  a  product  designed  to
address its specific needs? Even if it cost more? Or even if it had worse
performance  in  an  aspect  of  the  product  irrelevant  to  this  niche?  If  so,
think re-segmented market/niche strategy

Another  type  of  re-segmentation  answers  the  question:  Are  there
customers  at  the  low  end  of  an  existing  market  who  will  buy  “good
enough” performance if they can get it at a substantially lower price? If
yes, think re-segmented market/low-cost strategy

Without an established and well-defined market, there are obviously no
existing customers or competitors and a new market is being created

Startups  in  Russia,  India,  Indonesia,  Brazil,  Japan  and  China  (where
they  have  large  local  markets  and  language  and  cultural  barriers)  have
an additional market type: the clone market. Can you adopt/borrow/copy
an  already-successful  business  model  and  company  from  the  U.S.  and
adapt  it  to  local  language  and  buying  preferences.  (Not  too  long  from
now, ideas from those countries will be cloned in the U.S.)

When you talk to customers, they’ll have lots of opinions about where
the product fits. Don’t worry about wavering among the market-type choices.
For  now,  just  look  at  each  market  type  and  pick  the  one  that  best  fits  the
company’s vision today. Table 3.1 summarizes of the trade-offs.

Market Type Trade-Offs (Table 3.1)

One  of  the  best  tools  for  sorting  out  existing  market  entry  strategies  is
derived from military operations research. It suggests a few simple rules that
companies can use to analyze an existing market:

If  a  single  company  has  74  percent  of  the  market,  the  market  has
become  an  effective  monopoly.  For  a  startup,  that’s  an  unassailable
position for a head-on assault. (Think Google in search or Facebook in
social networks.)

If  the  combined  market  share  for  the  market  leader  and  the  second-
ranking  company  is  greater  than  74  percent  and  the  first  company  is
within 1.7 times the share of the second, it means a duopoly commands
the  market.  Its  position  is  impervious  to  attack  by  a  startup.  (In  the
telecom sector, Cisco’s and Juniper’s combined share of the core router
market fits this description.)

If  a  company  has  41  percent  market  share  and  at  least  1.7  times  the
market share of the next-largest company, it’s the market leader.

For a startup, this too is a very difficult market to enter. Markets with a

clear market leader offer an opportunity for re-segementation.

If the biggest player in a market has at least a 26 percent market share,

the  market  is  unstable,  with  a  strong  possibility  of  abrupt  shifts  in  the
company  rankings.  Here  there  may  be  some  existing  market  entry
opportunities.

If the biggest player has less than 26 percent market share, it has no real
influence on the market. Startups that want to enter an existing market
find these the easiest to penetrate.

If you decide to attack a market that has just one dominant player, you
need to be prepared to spend three times the combined sales and marketing
budget  of  that  dominant  player.  (Ouch—so  much  for  going  head-on  with
Google or Facebook.)

In a market that has multiple participants, the cost of entry is lower, but
you still need to spend 1.7 times the combined sales and marketing budget of
the company you plan to attack. (To enter an existing market, you must steal
market  share  from  an  incumbent,  hence  the  war  analogy.)  Table  3.2
summarizes the existing market cost of entry.

Market Type—Cost of Entry (Table 3.2)

Competition in an Existing Market

Now  that  you  understand  the  type  of  market  you’re  in,  the  competitive
landscape becomes clearer. If you believe your company and product fit into
an  existing  market,  you  need  to  understand  how  your  product  outperforms
your competitors’. In an existing market the customers can tell you what the
basis of competition is. It nearly always has to do with key product attributes,
but sometimes it’s other components of the business model—e.g., channel or

price. Strive for a product or feature or improvement that can get a customer
to say, “I’ll pay anything for that.”

Positioning  the  product  against  the  slew  of  existing  competitors  is
accomplished  by  adroitly  selecting  the  basis  of  competition  where  you  can
win.  Remember  it’s  not  always  features.  It  can  be  convenience,  services,
brand, etc., where the new entry is clearly better. Summarize the thinking in a
brief.  When  entering  an  existing  market,  good  questions  to  address  in  the
brief include:

Who are the incumbents and which ones drive the market?

What is the market share of each competitor?

How many marketing and sales dollars will the market leaders spend to
compete?

What will the cost of entry be against incumbent competitors?

What  performance  attributes  have  customers  said  are  important?  How
do competitors define performance?

What share of this market does the company want to capture in the first
three years?

How do the competitors define the market?

Are  there  existing  standards?  If  so,  whose  agenda  is  driving  the
standards?

Does  the  company  seek  to  embrace  these  standards,  extend  them,  or
replace  them?  (If  the  answer  is  to  extend  or  replace  them,  this  may
indicate  a  re-segmented  market.)  When  you  enter  an  existing  market,
though, also fill out the competitive brief discussed later in this section
to shape the positioning further

One  way  to  plan  your  attack  in  an  existing  market  is  to  refer  to  your
business model canvas. What jobs are your customers asking your product to
fill? What problem is your value proposition solving?

Re-segmenting an Existing Market

In  an  existing  market,  your  startup  is  the  weakest  player  with  the  least
resources. Therefore, attacking the strongest players head-on is foolish. You
want to choose strategies that acknowledge your weaknesses and play to your
agility. If there’s a dominant player with more than 74 percent market share,
don’t  attack  that  market  head-on.  Why?  Because  you  need  three  times  the
resources of the market leader. Instead, target your attack at the point where
your  limited  resources  can  make  a  difference.  You’ll  segment  the  existing
market  to  create  a  submarket  where  your  product  can  be  unique  or
substantially different. Or if you can create a new market, you can define a
space the market leader doesn’t address at all.

If your enemy is superior in strength, evade him. If
angry irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may
grow arrogant.

If  the  dominant  player  has  between  26  percent  and  74  percent  market
share,  pick  your  battles  carefully.  Remember  the  cost  of  a  head-on  attack:
three times the budget of a single competitor or 1.7 times that of a competitor
in a crowded market.

Most startups don’t have access to those financial resources. Therefore,
re-segmenting  the  market  or  creating  a  new  market  is  almost  always  the
default when faced with a dominant incumbent. All the marketing tricks for
nipping  at  the  heels  of  an  entrenched  competitor  can  be  used  here.  Most  of
them  were  invented  2,500  years  ago  by  Sun  Tzu  and  described  in  his  book
The  Art  of  War.  Paraphrasing  about:  “All  warfare  is  based  on  deception.  If
your enemy is superior evade him. If angry irritate him. If equally matched,
fight, and if not, re-evaluate”.

Your goal is to become No. 1 in something important to your customer.
It could be product attribute, territory, distribution chain/retailer, or customer
base. Keep segmenting the market (by age, income, region, etc.) and focusing
on  the  competitors’  weak  points  until  you  have  a  battle  you  can  win.
Remember, any company can take customers away from any other company
—if  it  can  define  the  battle.  When  re-segmenting  an  existing  market,
positioning rests on either:
     (a)  finding a unique niche where some product feature or service

 
redefines the market, creating a clear competitive advantage

     (b)  being the “low-cost provider” or
     (c)  combining differentiation and lower operating cost into a Blue Ocean

Strategy that creates an uncontested market space and makes the
competition irrelevant while creating and capturing new demand.
Southwest Airlines was among the first to re-segment air travel this
way, followed by many copycat failures and much later by JetBlue.
Cirque du Soleil is an example of a Blue Ocean re-segmentation,
offering product differentiation as well as lower operating costs

In an existing market, your startup is the weakest
player with the least resources.

When re-segmenting for a unique niche, address these questions in this brief:

What existing markets are customers coming from?

What are the unique characteristics of those customers?

What  compelling  needs  of  those  customers  are  unmet  by  existing
suppliers?

What  compelling  product  features  will  get  customers  to  abandon  their
current suppliers?

Why couldn’t existing companies offer the same thing?

How  long  will  it  take  you  to  grow  a  market  of  sufficient  size?  What
size?

How will the company educate the market and create demand?

Given that no customers yet exist in the new segment, what are realistic
sales forecasts?

How can this forecast be tested?

Can  parts  of  the  business  model  be  changed  to  differentiate  the
company?

For  this  type  of  startup,  draw  a  “market  map”  (a  diagram  of  how  this

 
new market will look) as shown in Figure 3.9, to illustrate why the company
is  unique.  Draw  the  market  map  with  the  startup  in  the  center.  A  re-
segmented  market  assumes  that  customers  flow  from  an  existing  market(s).
Draw the existing markets that customers should flow from (remember that a
market  is  a  set  of  companies  with  common  attributes).  Draw  the  product
features  and  functions  that,  when  assembled,  best  describe  the  new  product
(think Hershey bar, now with peanut butter and zero calories—each attribute
draws different customer groups).

Example of a Market Map (Figure 3.9)

When re-segmenting based on low cost, questions to address include:

What existing markets are customers coming from?

What are the unique characteristics of those customers?

What  price  will  it  take  (known  as  “switching  cost”)  to  get  those
customers to spend time online with or buy from the new company?

What features are customers willing to give up to get the lower price?

How can this hypothesis be tested quantitatively?

Finally,  visualize  why  thousands  of  new  customers  will  believe  in  and
move to this market. And beware the “low-price provider” re-segmentation,
since competitors can reprice in a matter of days if not hours, eviscerating the
positioning that everyone just bet the new business on.

 The market map is particularly important for new web-based businesses.
Consider how much time you expect consumers to spend on the site, whether
for personal accounting, online gaming or social networking. Then consider
where the time will come from: will they abandon Site A or B, sleep less, or
do  all  their  e-mail  on  the  new  social  network?  It’s  a  market  map  based  on
minutes, not dollars.

Where will the minutes come from, and how and why will they come to
the  new  company.  For  social  networks,  it’s  the  “Facebook  question:”  what
can people do on the new social network that they can’t or don’t already do
on Facebook, the market leader, and why will they do it elsewhere?

It’s  the  web/mobile  equivalent  of  market  share.  Explain  how  and  why
consumers will “trade in” time they currently spend elsewhere for time on the
new site. If a new online game won’t cut back on someone’s playtime with
Farmville  or  Mafia  Wars,  where  will  he  or  she  find  the  time  to  play  an
additional new game? Figure it out and map the “time source.”

What could be better than a market with no
competitors?

Entering a New Market

 
What  if  there  are  no  competitors?  What  if,  after  talking  to  all  your  early
customers,  you  continue  to  hear,  “There’s  nothing  else  like  what  your
company is offering”? What if, after looking at all the quantitative data, you
can’t  find  other  companies  with  comparable  products?  Congratulations—
you’re creating a new market. At first glance, a new market has great appeal.
A standing joke is that every new market has its own descriptive TLA (three-
letter  acronym).  What  could  be  better  than  a  market  with  no  competitors?
And absence of competition typically means that pricing isn’t a competitive
issue  but  an  issue  of  what  the  market  will  bear.  Wow,  no  competitors  and
high margins!

A  company  creating  a  new  market  is  a  radically  different  type  of
company from one entering or reframing an existing market. While there are
no  market-share  battles  with  competitors,  there  are  also  no  existing
customers.  If  there  are  no  existing  customers,  even  an  infinite  demand-
creation  budget  at  the  point  of  product  launch  won’t  garner  market  share.
Creating a new market is about long-term customer education and adoption.
New-market  entries  are  by  far  the  most  expensive  demand-creation
challenges, particularly since the marketer can’t say “tastier than Yummies”
or  “faster  than  Porsche”  or  “cheaper  than  Brand  X,”  since  no  such
comparables  exist.  At  the  risk  of  sounding  pedantic,  creating  a  new  market
means  a  market  doesn’t  currently  exist—there  are  no  customers.  When
entering a new market, good questions to address include:

What are the markets adjacent to the new one being created?

What markets will potential customers come from?

What’s the company’s vision and why will lots of people care?

What  “never  could  have  been  done  before”  will  make  customers
use/buy?

How long will it take to educate potential customers to grow a market of
sufficient size? What size is that?

How will the company educate the market? How will it create demand?

Given that no customers yet exist, what are realistic sales forecasts for
the first three years?

How  much  financing  will  it  take  to  soldier  on  while  educating  and

growing the market?

What  will  stop  a  well-heeled  competitor  from  taking  over  the  market
once  the  startup  develops  it?  (This  phenomenon  is  the  source  of  the
phrase “Pioneers are the ones with arrows in their backs.”)

Is  the  product  better-defined  as  one  that  will  re-segment  a  market  or
enter an existing one?

New-market entries are by far the most expensive...

Companies  compete  in  new  markets  not  by  besting  other  companies
with  product  features  but  by  convincing  a  set  of  customers  that  the  new
company’s market vision is real and solves a real problem a different way. A
few  classic  examples:  Snapple,  Toyota  Prius,  Siebel,  Groupon,  and
Facebook. However, who the users are, and the definition of the market itself
are  both  clearly  unknown.  This  brief  defines  the  new  market  and  its  users
with the startup at the center.

One last thing to consider: startups creating new markets won’t create a
market of sufficient size to generate a profit until three to seven years from
product  launch.  This  sobering  piece  of  data  is  derived  from  looking  at  the
results of hundreds of high-tech startups of the last twenty years. While you
may  be  convinced  your  startup  is  the  exception,  the  odds  say  that  unless
you’re  in  a  “bubble  economy,”  it  takes  time  for  new  ideas  and  products  to
diffuse  and  catch  on.  (A  bubble  economy  is  defined  as  a  time  of  irrational
exuberance in a market when all normal rules are repealed.)
Market type, in summary: Market type is one of the most important choices
founders need to make and agree on with investors, since it drives spending,
timing and competitive analysis. The choice doesn’t need to be made during
customer  discovery,  but  an  initial  hypothesis  is  needed.  If  investors  are
expecting  substantial  revenue  in  Year  One,  thinking  they’ve  invested  in  an
existing-market company, the outcome is typically a new CEO. Market type
selection drives spending and budget as well as revenue expectations.

Competitive Brief

 
Once  you  understand  your  market  type,  it’s  relatively  simple  to  assemble  a
competitive  brief.  This  will  help  you  understand  how  you’ll  compete  in  the
market.

When  entering  an  existing  market  or  re-segmenting  one,  your  first
instinct may be that the basis of competition is simply the product features of
your  value  proposition.  That  may  be,  but  you  may  be  missing  a  bigger
competitive  advantage.  Is  there  something  about  partners,  the  channel,
resources,  etc.  that  would  be  a  game  changer?  Think  of  Apple  and  the
original iPod. It combined a hardware player, which lots of vendors had, with
an  easy-to-use  software  application,  iTunes,  which  no  one  had  (but  others
could have built) and then added partners at the record labels (which required
Steve  Jobs’  reality-distortion  field).  The  business  model  canvas  is  a  perfect
vehicle for brainstorming some of these ideas.

In a new market, it’s tempting to say, “We have no
competition.” But you’ll be wrong.

Explain  how  and  why  your  new  product  is  better  than  its  competitors.

Other items the competitive brief should consider:

How have existing competitors defined the basis of competition? Is it in
terms  of  product  attributes?  Service?  What  are  their  claims?  Features?
What makes the new company and its product stand out as dramatically
different? Features? Performance? Price?

Will  customers  care  if  the  new  product  lets  them  do  something  they
couldn’t do before?

In a retail store, which competitive products will be shelved next to the
new entry?

For web/mobile apps, assess competitors’ product quality, features, sales
or user data, and traffic levels.

What’s  strongest  about  each  competitor’s  product?  What  do  current
customers  like  most  about  those  existing  products?  What  would
customers change about them?

 
What  is  a  customer’s  “reason  to  buy”  or  use  the  product,  app,  or  site?
And which competitors will they abandon to do so, and why?

If  you’re  in  a  new  market,  it’s  tempting  to  say,  “We  have  no
competition.” But you’ll be wrong. The new product itself may not yet exist,
but what do people do today without it? Do they simply not do something, or
do  it  badly  or  inefficiently?  What  will  your  new  product  enable  them  to  do
that they couldn’t do before. Why will they care?

It’s  only  natural  that  startups  compare  themselves  with  other  startups
around  them,  but  it’s  important  to  remember  a  key  tenet  of  Customer
Development: Don’t make a list of all competitors’ features to simply make a
bigger  list.  A  few  incremental  features  or  improvements  seldom  result  in  a
great,  scalable  company.  What’s  more,  in  their  first  few  years,  startups
seldom put one another out of business.

Winners understand why customers buy.

While  startups  compete  for  funding  and  technical  resources,  winners
understand  why  customers  buy.  The  losers  never  do.  Competitive  analysis
starts  at  why  customers  will  buy  and  then  looks  at  the  whole  market,
including new and established competitors.

Customer Relationships Hypothesis

  This  customer  relationships  brief  describes  how  you  get  customers  to
your  website  or  mobile  app,  keep  them  as  customers  and  grow  additional
revenue from them over time.

The “Get, Keep and Grow” Customers Funnel in Web/Mobile
(Figure 3.10)

PROCEED WITH CAUTION: This is not the time to broadly launch
your site or app to a wide audience. You are writing the briefs here, not
implementing tactics with your MVP!

 
Review  the  previous  section  on  customer  relationships  for  physical
products before starting this one. The web/mobile customer funnel in Figure
3.10  is  quite  different  from  its  physical  counterpart  in  Figure 3.15.  Getting
customers  here  is  simpler,  having  only  two  steps.  It  also  includes  a  “viral
loop” where early customers invite friends and colleagues to explore the new
product.  Finally,  not  visible  in  the  diagram  is  the  fact  that  web/mobile
startups can test tactics faster, market less expensively, and reach out to far
more customers than companies in the physical channel.

The test of “Get, Keep and Grow” activities during customer discovery
is  small-scale,  exposing  the  “rough  and  dirty,”  or  low-fidelity,  minimum
viable product to a modest number of customers, perhaps a few hundred or
so, to gauge their reaction to the business model (including value proposition,
price,  and  product  features.)  Discovery  explores  which  tactics  work  and
gauges initial reactions to the MVP.

Customer Relationship for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.3)

 
The  right-hand  column  of  Table  3.3  provides  an  overview  of
web/mobile “Get, Keep and Grow” strategies and tactics. It focuses first on
getting customers, since the company first has to have customers before it can
work to keep them, sell them a second time, or grow them.

Many web/mobile products operate as multi-sided markets; Google and
Facebook  are  canonical  examples.  Consumers  use  the  product  at  no  cost.
Advertisers  pay  the  company  to  reach  those  customers  with  ads,  AdWords,
textlinks  and  other  marketing  messages.  That  revenue  is  why  Google  can
afford to build massive data centers and offer search for “Free.”

Multi-sided  marketers  need  two  separate,  parallel  “Get”  approaches—
one for the users and another for the payers, since the value proposition for
each is quite different. Almost universally, multi-sided marketers focus first
on efforts to get users. A company that has aggregated an audience of many
millions can almost certainly find marketers eager to pay for the privilege of
communicating with that audience.

Getting Customers: Acquisition and Activation

Develop the company’s hypothesis about how it will “Get” customers.

There  are  a  million-plus  apps  for  sale  on  mobile  app  stores  and  an
infinite  number  of  commerce,  social  and  content  websites,  so  the  mere  fact
that  you’ve  launched  a  new  one  doesn’t  make  it  a  successful  business.
Building your product is the easy part. The hard part is getting customers to
find your app, site or product. It’s a daunting, never-ending challenge to build
customer relationships, quite literally, one customer at a time.

Building your product is easy. The hard part is
Getting Customers.

Acquisition vs. Activation: What’s the Difference?

 
Let’s get started with the first two steps for “getting” customers: acquisition
and activation.

“Get Customers” Tools for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4a)

Customer  Acquisition:  The  acquisition  phase  equates  to  the  “awareness,”
“interest,”  and  “consideration”  steps  in  the  physical  channel,  where
customers learn about and explore a product before they buy. In web/mobile
apps, the “Get” effort focuses on bringing as many customers as possible to
the  company’s  online  “front  door”—the  landing  page.  There,  they’re
introduced to the product and hopefully buy it or use it. Since the number of
people  who  come  to  a  landing  page  and  look  but  don’t  buy  or  use  is  often
very  high,  web/mobile  “Get”  plans  must  reach  lots  of  people—for  a
consumer website, that can be millions.

Customer Activation: This second step in the “Get” process is much like the
“purchase”  step  in  the  physical  channel.  Here  the  customer  shows  interest
through  a  free  download  or  trial,  a  request  for  more  information,  or  a
purchase.  A  customer  should  be  considered  activated  even  if  he  doesn’t

purchase or register, as long as the company has enough information to re-
contact him (whether by e-mail, phone, text, etc.) with explicit permission to
do so.

Overview: How Customers Shop Online

Unlike  the  door-to-door  salesmen  of  yesteryear,  your  job  on  the  web  is  to
“pull”  customers  to  you  rather  than  to  push  your  product  at  them.  The  web
offers a near-limitless tool set to help you pull customers in.

Your job on the web is to “pull” customers to you...

Your  first  step  in  customer  acquisition  and  activation  is  understanding  how
people buy or engage with your product. Here’s how it happens:

Step one: People discover a need or want to solve a problem. They say, “I
want  to  throw  a  party,”  or  feel  lonely  and  decide  to  find  a  hot  party  or  a
dating site. Then what?

Step two: They begin a search. Overwhelmingly, in this century, that search
begins  online.  It  often  happens  at  Google.com,  but  it  can  happen  on
Facebook,  where  they  ask  their  friends,  or  on  Quora,  where  they  solicit
opinions,  or  on  hundreds  of  other  special-interest  “recommendation”  sites
from Yelp to Zagat to TripAdvisor.com.

Step three:  They  don’t  look  very  hard.  People  don’t  just  “find”  you  online,
and in fact they often only pay attention to the first few things they uncover
(how often do you search beyond the first page of results on Google?). You
must  make  your  site,  app  or  product  as  visible  as  humanly  possible,  in  as
many of these places as possible where your customers are likely to begin the
search. (The entire “Get” section ahead will guide you in doing just this.)

Step four: They go where they’re invited, entertained or informed. You don’t
“earn”  interest  from  your  customers  with  hard-boiled  sales  pitches  or  bland
information.  In  a  typical  Google  search,  you’re  one  of  many  thousands  of
options the customer can click on. So you have to earn that click by providing

 
inviting,  helpful  or  entertaining  information  in  lots  of  formats  (copy,
diagrams,  white  papers,  blogs,  videos,  games,  demos,  you  name  it)  and  by
participating in the communities and social media your customers are likely
to be.

Develop your “Get Customers” Strategy

Make  your  information  as  rich  and  inviting—and  widely  available—as
possible  and  cast  the  widest-possible  net  when  people  begin  their  search.
Provide  helpful,  non-sales-y  information  that  leads  them  back  to  your
product, app, or site. Then the selling process begins.

Use the way people make decisions to guide your acquisition and activation
strategy:

1.  Determine  who  your  audience  is,  then  your  goal  is  to  be  prominent
wherever  they  spend  time  on  the  web.  Skateboarders  don’t  read  The
Wall  Street  Journal  or  TechCrunch  very  much,  so  focus  on
skateboarding sites, blogs and the like.

2.  What  kind  of  content  will  they  find  attractive?  Our  skateboarders
probably  prefer  illustrations,  games,  and  videos  over  long  essays  and
white  papers.  Reach  them  with  the  kinds  of  content  they’ll  find  most
interesting  and  helpful,  such  as  tips  on  safer  skateboarding  or  bolder
tricks, not long essays on the finer points of boarding.

3.  Make  sure  your  content  works  in  the  location.  Quora,  Twitter,  and
Facebook  users  expect  short,  interesting  items  and  get  bogged  down
with  or  ignore  long  ones.  Social  networks  don’t  have  much  use  for
lengthy sales pitches. Be sure your content “fits” where you put it.

4.  Participate  in  the  communities  your  customers  are  a  part  of.  Answer
questions,  provide  feedback,  offer  tips,  and  gently  invite  people  to
explore your product.

5.  Create  content  that  people  want  to  link  to.  Whether  it’s  helpful  tips,
FAQs,  cartoons  or  fun  videos,  make  your  content  the  kind  of  content
your  customers  want  to  share  with  friends.  The  result  extends  your
invitation to those friends more often than not.

Customer Acquisition Tactics to Test

The best way to get this started is to put your initial acquisition test plan into
a  spreadsheet  outlining  the  activities,  their  costs,  and  each  program’s  goals.
See  a  sample  acquisition-plan  spreadsheet  in  the  “Activate Plan”  section  of
Chapter  8.  Acquisition  begins  by  using  free  or  earned  web-media
opportunities  to  acquire  customers,  since  “free”  is  obviously  the  best  cost.
The web offers many free crowd-sourcing or acquisition opportunities (SEO,
social media, viral marketing, buzz and more).

Earned or free acquisition tactics:

Public  relations:  Generate  small  “test”  amounts  of  news  and  feature
coverage  about  the  problem  (not  the  product  itself)  on  websites,  blogs
and  social  nets.  Don’t  publicize  the  product  or  solution  until  customer
validation,  it’s  just  too  early.  (Public  relations  doesn’t  mean  hire  an
expensive  outside  agency.  During  customer  discovery,  you  should  be
learning this firsthand.)

Viral  marketing:  This  often-confused  term  refers  to  three  types  of
acquisition marketing, each used in different web/mobile channels. The
three  are  perhaps  the  most  important  customer  acquisition  tactics  for
web/mobile  marketers,  because  they’re  all  free  or  inexpensive  to
implement.  This  is  discussed  in  “grow” customers  where  viral  activity
encourages customers to refer others

Search  engine  optimization  (SEO),  an  unpaid,  or  “natural,”  search
option, directs consumers to the product or service

Social networking encourages friends and early customers to blog about
a  product  or  a  company,  use  Facebook  to  “like”  it,  or  use  Twitter  and
other tools to broadcast personal recommendations

After  you  get  the  free  acquisition  programs  going,  you  should  start  to

test paid tactics.

Paid acquisition tactics:

It’s  hard  to  determine  how  much  money  to  spend  on  acquisition  tactics,  in
part because there are so many variables: how much funding you have, how
confident  you  are  in  your  hypotheses,  and  how  hard  it  is  to  find  your
customers  are  three  of  the  key  considerations.  Obviously,  free  tactics  are
better than paid tactics when they deliver quality customers with strong LTV
in  sufficient  numbers  to  create  a  great  business.  As  a  rule,  however,  life  is
seldom that easy, and you’ll need to test a blend of paid tactics along with a
wider variety of free ones.

Here are some of the most common web/mobile paid acquisition tactics you
should consider:

Pay-per-click  (PPC)  advertising:  targetable,  accountable  paid  search
advertising on Google and other search engines drives targeted traffic to
the company

Online  or  traditional  media  advertising:  often  used  to  introduce  a  new
product or service

Affiliate marketing: other related websites are paid to drive traffic to the
product site or app.

Online  lead  generation:  purchase  of  permission-based  e-mail  lists  to
solicit  interest  (much  trickier  and  more  highly  regulated  for  direct-to-
mobile-phone messaging)

Review the list of “get” customers tactics from the physical channel to
see  which  ones  warrant  testing  for  your  web/mobile  startup.  Candidates
certainly include advertising, direct mail, and everything from zany on-street
promotions to blimps, billboards and more.

Some quick and simple acquisition tests:

In  Phase  2  of  customer  discovery  you’ll  run  some  small-scale  acquisition
tests with the free and paid tactics described above to test your understanding
of the customer problem/need. In Phase 3 of customer discovery, you’ll again
use  acquisition  tools  to  gauge  initial  customer  reaction  to  the  MVP  and
discover whether the MVP is a compelling solution to the problem. These are
limited and targeted tests, not a product launch. Press releases make no sense

here,  for  example,  since  wide  dissemination  could  either  bring  too  many
customers  or  create  the  false  impression  that  the  product  is  “launched”  and
finished.
Your  Phase  2  &  3  acquisition  tests  should  be  limited  to  controllable,
inexpensive, easily measured tactics like these:
          •      Buy  $500  worth  of  AdWords  and  see  if  they’ll  drive  customers
representing five or 10 times that amount in potential revenue to the
site or app and at least get them to register. Test at least two different
headlines  and  as  many  calls  to  action,  carefully  monitoring  the
performance of each. Drop ineffective ones and refine the best

Viral marketing can’t start until there is a customer
base to viralize.

     •   Use Facebook messages or Tweet to measurable audiences to invite at
least 1,000 people to explore the new product. Test several different
messages or invitations to be sure the messaging about the product is
clear.  If  none  of  the  messages  delivers  engagement  or  registrations,
the product or offer may well be the problem

     •   Viral marketing: Getting customers can’t start until there’s a customer
base to viralize. There are several types of viral marketing, so review
the viral discussion in the previous section (and also here). Network-
effect businesses should consider viral activities sooner

     •   Post referral banners using Commission Junction to get sites offering
your offer. Spend $1,000 in referral fees to relevant websites (usually
$12 per referral). If the banners run and the money’s largely unspent,
move on

     •   Buy an e-mail blast list of targeted customers for $500 or $1,000. Send
at least two versions of the offer and expect to generate at least three
times the potential revenue to at least sign up, if not a purchase
     •   Traffic partners are another important source of users or customers that
fuel  the  “Get”  effort.  These  are  typically  contractual  relationships
with other companies that provide predictable streams of customers or
users to your company while you provide either customers or fees to
the partner. This is so important to most web/mobile businesses that
it’s addressed in its own “traffic partners” hypothesis

 
Who’s Creating This Content?

Successful  web/mobile  startup  teams  have  a  combination  of  skills:  great
technology skills (hacking/hardware/science), great hustling skills (to search
for the business model, customers and market), and great user-facing design.
The  co-founder  who’s  the  user-interface/design  expertise  owns  content
creation. Ideally he or she is talented enough to create it without legions of
hourly-rate  agency  folk  around.  Use  guru.com  and  craigslist.com  to  find
talent, cost-effective freelancers with good references.

Customer Activation Tactics to Test:

Activation is the second step in getting customers. As discussed earlier, this
is  where  the  customer  either  makes  a  purchase  or,  at  a  minimum,  raises  a
hand  and  says,  “I’m  interested,  contact  me.”  Activation  could  be  an
exploratory  visit  your  website  or  free  mobile  app  to  see  how  a  game  is
played,  a  comment  posted  on  a  blog  or  social  network,  or  the  use  of  a  free
search  engine.  At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  low-cost  mobile  apps  and
other  products  find  transactions  to  be  the  best  initial  activation,  since  the
product may be a free version or cost only 99 cents.

Activation is the choke point... where customers
decide whether they want to participate, play or
purchase.

For web/mobile businesses, activation is the choke point—the make-or-
break place where customers decide whether they want to participate, play, or
purchase.  Here,  unlike  the  physical  channel,  the  “product  is  the  salesman,”
encouraging visitors to explore, try, or read about the product on their own,
without  pressure  or  patter  from  a  sales  representative.  Activation  is  always
encouraged  by  a  compelling  value  proposition,  well-communicated  and
coupled  with  a  good,  clear  offer  and  a  low-fidelity  (in  discovery)  or  hi-
fidelity  (in  validation)  MVP.  Start  by  creating  an  activation-tactics  plan  in
simple spreadsheet form as in this example.

 
Many  startups  falsely  assume  that  because  their  customers  are  online,
online communication is all their customers want or expect. Very often, even
a  single  phone  call  can  make  a  dramatic  difference  in  acquisition  and
activation rates. In some instances, as few as half the customers who discover
a product online will activate or buy without human-to-human contact. And
the  presence  of  a  phone  number  is  known  to  communicate  the  company’s
authenticity.  Just  the  presence  of  the  company’s  phone  number—even  if
never called—can increase its online click-through rate by five percent to 30
percent.  (When  adding  a  phone  number,  be  sure  it’s  answered  promptly,
knowledgeably,  and  effectively  by  someone  with  incentives  to  activate  the
caller.)

Acquisition and Activation in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 3.12)

Some quick activation tests:

     •   Capture the customer’s e-mail address and get permission to follow up
with further information. Follow up with 1,000 customers and expect
at least 50 or more to agree to activate

     •   Offer incentives for activation: Offer a free trial, download, or white

paper  or  a  significant  discount  to  500  or  1,000  customers.  Try  this
with  at  least  three  different  offers,  hoping  to  find  at  least  one  that
generates a 5 percent or greater response rate. Keep testing until you
do, and then calculate the revenue model based on response rates, and
costs

     •   Call 100 prospects who don’t activate immediately. See if the phone
calls generate enough of a response-rate improvement to warrant the
cost. Three times the response rate is probably needed

     •   Free-to-paid conversion: Offer a seven- or 14-day free trial of an app,
service,  or  web/mobile  product.  Then  compare  the  total  60-day
acquisition revenue with the Get results of the typical paid offer. Or
offer  the  use  of  some  but  not  all  of  the  site  or  app’s  features.
eHarmony.com, for example, lets people find their ideal matches for
free but requires paid enrollment to tell your dream date that you’ve
discovered him or her

Even a single phone call can make a dramatic
difference in acquisition and activation rates.

          •      Use free-download websites  to  offer  free  downloads  or  trials.  Make
sure  the  revenue  generated  over  a  90-day  period  exceeds  that  of  the
standard activation offer

Monitor the results of all tests and, when you’re not satisfied (or it fails

your pass/fail test) revise the program and test again.

Keeping Customers (Customer Retention)

 
The “Keep Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 3.13)

Keeping  customers  in  the  web/mobile  channels  has  the  same  goal  as
retention efforts in the physical world: to minimize customer churn/attrition
by  providing  great  products  and  services,  and  interacting  with  customers
often. (At this point in customer discovery, there aren’t customers to retain,
so identify retention programs to test in the future.) Retention is done more
easily online, where companies have the incredible power and ability to track

and monitor every single prospect’s or customer’s individual behavior or lack
of behavior (without violating their privacy).

“Keep Customers” Tools in Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4b)

Loyalty  and  points  programs  and  other  tactics  borrowed  from  the
physical  channel  can  also  play  a  significant  role  here,  as  can  elegant
personalized  customer  service  and  support,  conducted  digitally  as  much  as
possible. Strong digital help tools, FAQs, user blogs, clubs, and newsletters
help with retention as well.

Customer Retention Strategy

Retention programs live or die by a close monitoring of customer behavior to
learn who’s staying and who’s leaving and why. It’s critical to instrument the
product  not  in  order  to  track  everything  but  in  order  to  follow  the  most
important customer behaviors you want to improve.

For example:

Track  start  dates  and  sources  of  each  customer  (referred  by  a  blogger,
another site, etc.)

Track customers’ activity level individually. How often do they come?
How long is each visit? What’s the time span between visits?

When  do  customers  abandon,  and  what  were  they  doing  that  caused
them to do so?

Monitor customers’ behavior on-site: what do they click on, what don’t
they click on?

Track customer referrals to others and the sources and activity level of
referred visitors

Track  the  results  of  each  promotion,  whether  outbound  or  on  the  site
itself

PROCEED  WITH  CAUTION:  Remember, 
an
overview/tutorial.  There’s  no  way  you  can  implement  all  this  or  even
process this in one sitting.

this 

is 

Keep the following guidelines in mind as you test:

E-mail is easy to ignore and at times feels like spam, so be careful about
overly relying on it. At least four of five e-mails are never opened, and
consumers often unsubscribe from self-serving marketing e-mails

Consumers  often  resent  “faux”  personalization.  People  appreciate
legitimate,  helpful  personalization  if  they’ve  opted  in  for  example
(“Here  are  the  sneakers  we  have  in  your  size,  11D”  is  far  better  than
“Great buys for Bob”)

Don’t get lazy and make automated marketing and e-mail programs your
only  customer-retention  efforts.  Focus  on  great  product,  product

 
 
enchancements, terrific service and other core retention initiatives

Embrace  social  networks  as  points  of  retention.  Use  them  to  keep
visibility high and to invite customers and friends back often

The key for retention for web/mobile channels is that the data customers
have  given  you  make  personalized  retention  efforts  easy.  But  you  need  to
collect  it.  Observe  each  customer’s  behavior  and  interact  with  customers
based on what they do or don’t do.

Track the behavior of each customer individually. Use that data to create
a  personal  one-to-one  relationship  that  guides  him  to  the  next  steps  the
company wants him to take. (But always respect personal-data privacy.)

Retention programs live or die by a close
monitoring of customer behavior.

Simple Retention Tests to Consider:

The hypothesis should include some core initial retention efforts that will be
discussed  during  discovery  and  tested  on  a  modest  scale  later,  during
customer validation. Be sure to include digital versions of relevant programs
outlined in the physical section. Some specific tactics to test:
     •   Outreach programs, including welcome e-mails, how-to guides, and
phone calls thanking the user for coming aboard and offering simple
tips on how to get more out of the product. Consider retention e-mails
like these:
   We haven’t seen you visit in two weeks. Is everything OK?
   I’ve noticed you’ve had a few problems. How can we help?
   Have you seen some of the new features on our site?
   Here are five “power user” ideas for getting more out of your time

at XYZ.com

     •   Blogs, RSS and news feeds to further engage customers or users with

the product or site

     •   Loyalty programs that encourage and reward repeat visits, purchases, or

referrals borrowed from the physical channel

     •   Contests and special events: webinars, special guests, new features, and

 
          
          
          
          
other reasons for current customers to come back

          •      Mobile  app  push  notifications:  iOS/Android  gives  developers  the
ability to push messages to users even when the app is closed. For app
developers,  getting  this  right  is  critical  to  retention  and  customer
engagement

     •   Product updates and enhancements to the actual product itself always
drive  loyalty  and  retention  (and  communicating  them  to  customers
helps)

Getting new customers is painful and costly, so
keeping those already on the roster is easier and
more cost-effective.

     •   Placing live phone calls to users several weeks or (if annual) a month
or  more  before  contract  renewal  is  a  good  option  if  you  have  a
subscription  revenue  model.  Make  them  friendly,  service-oriented
calls, but always listen for signs of potential churn and be ready with
a deal, discount or offer to save the customer. Remember: getting new
customers is painful and costly, so keeping those already on the roster
is easier and more cost-effective

     •   Tips-and-tricks newsletters, time-triggered e-mails every seven or 14

days based on users’ on-site behavior or lack of visits

          •      Personalized  customer  service  and  support,  conducted  digitally  as
much as possible. Strong digital help tools, FAQs, user blogs, clubs,
and newsletters help with retention as well

     •   Customer lock-in/high switching costs: If it’s relatively easy for your
customer  to  switch  from  your  products  to  your  competitors’  (in  an
existing  market)  you’ll  probably  have  a  higher  churn  rate.  You  may
want to consider tactics to “lock in” your customer to your product or
solution (through unique technology, data that can’t be transferred—
think  Facebook  and  LinkedIn—or  high  startup  costs  with  a  new
vendor.)

Monitor Specific Retention Metrics

 
Monitor and act on at least these basic retention metrics:

signs of dwindling visits, page views or time spent on the site or app

increased time between visits

average customer life (how long they stay active) and, if possible later,
lifetime value

increases in complaints, help or support tickets

reduced response rates or open rates on company e-mails

Organize the metrics around “cohorts,” or common groups of customers
(like  “those  who  joined  in  January”),  since,  for  example,  three-month
customers  may  behave  one  way  while  nine-month  customers  may  be  much
more or less active than their newer brethren. (This is addressed in detail in
the retention-optimization discussion in Chapter 9.)

Growing Customers (New Revenue and Referrals)

The “Grow Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels
(Figure 3.14)

There  are  two  ways  to  grow  existing  customers:  get  current  customers  to
spend  more  money  or  encourage  them  to  send  more  customers  to  the
company. These programs are detailed in Chapter 9 (Optimize Getting More
Customers).  By  then  your  company  should  have  a  sizeable  number  of
customers to grow!

“Grow Customers” Tools for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4c)

1. Get Current Customers to Spend More

Getting current customers to buy more starts by making sure they’re satisfied
with  the  product,  performance  and  price.  Then  you  try  to  sell  them  more
product, upgrade their service, or extend their contracts. These activities are
important for the long-term, so test at least a few during customer validation.
Some of the basic approaches to Grow Customers include:

 
 
Cross-sell programs that encourage buyers of a product to buy adjacent
products. Getting buyers of toner cartridges, for example—to buy paper,
pencils, and other office products

Up-selling programs that promote the purchase of “more” of higher-end
products.  For  example,  buying  cases  of  toner  rather  than  single
cartridges,  or  the  purchase  of  copiers,  fax  machines  and  other  office
machines along with the toner

Next-selling  programs  that  concentrate  on  the  next  order:  can  the
company  encourage  a  long-term  toner  contract,  sell  the  customer
envelopes  to  put  the  copies  in,  or  become  his  primary  office-products
supplier?  These  basic  customer  growth  strategies  work  in  consumer
goods as well as business-to-business

Unbundling,  which  sometimes  grows  revenue.  If  a  product  is  complex
or  multi-featured,  split  it  into  several  products,  each  sold  separately.
This works well in many tech, software, and industrial product areas

For  now,  develop  a  hypothesis  about  how  the  company  will  grow  its

customers, and test those ideas with—who else?—customers.

Some simple “grow” programs to consider:

Every “thank you” or confirmation page should suggest multiple items
the customer may also find interesting, and ideally provide an incentive
for doing so

New  items,  special  offers,  and  discounts  for  increasing  the  order  size
should be prominent and integrated with the checkout process for high
visibility

e-commerece  companies  should  have  “recommendation  engines.”  “If
you bought X, you’ll love Y”

e-commerce  companies  should  include  special  offers  and  discounts  in
each shipment

e-mail  customers  to  introduce  new  and  different  products  or  “add-on”
features to buy

Promote  special  sales  and  offers  on  new  products  or  services  the

customer hasn’t bought

Customer  referrals  are  the  most  common  type  of  viral  marketing,
although  they  obviously  can’t  begin  until  you  actually  have  customers
(so  it’s  discussed  in  the  “Grow”  section).  Viral  marketing  stimulates
referrals  of  customers  from  other  happy  customers.  Generate  attention
among  the  largest  audience  possible.  Consider  tools  like  YouTube  and
conferences you can attend and perhaps speak or promote at. Encourage
friends of the company and its team to invite their friends to learn more.
Consider  contests,  sweepstakes  and  promotions  to  drive  the  reach  of
viral efforts

Viral  products  help  sell  themselves.  Hotmail,  Gmail,  Facebook  and
many other web products end every customer communication by saying,
“Invite  a  friend  to  use  our  service.”  When  used,  it’s  powerful  and
virtually free viral marketing

Network-effect  virality  boosts  usage  of  products 
like  Skype,
Photobucket,  and  even  fax  machines.  You  can’t  talk  via  Skype  with  a
friend  who  doesn’t  have  it  or  fax  someone  without  a  fax  machine,  so
customers encourage others to join, expanding the network for their own
benefit. In the process, they get new users for the company

Customer referrals are the most “honest” source of
new business...

2. Get Customers to Send More Customers to the
Company

There are lots of different viral marketing tools and tactics that help you get
customers  to  refer  other  customers  to  the  company.  Here  are  the  six  most
powerful viral marketing techniques to consider:

Encourage customers to “like” the product on Facebook

Offer customers discounts or free trial offers to share with friends

 
Enable  customers  to  e-mail  their  friends  using  their  address  books  to
create mailing lists

Create contests or incentives to encourage Tweeting, “liking” and other
viral activities

Highlight  social-networking  action  buttons  on  the  site  to  make  viral
efforts easy

Encourage  bloggers  to  write  about  the  product,  and  reward  them  for
doing so

(The  customer  relationship  hypotheses  should  also  address  how  the
“Get, Keep and Grow” programs will be optimized once they’re under way.
For guidance in these areas, see Optimizaton Plans/Tools.)

Customer Relationships Hypothesis (Physical)

This customer-relationship brief describes how you get  customers  into  your
sales  channel,  keep  them  as  customers  and  grow  additional  revenue  from
them over time.

The “Get, Keep, Grow” Funnel in Physical Channels (Figure 3.15)

While  Figure  3.15  illustrates  the  flow  through  the  process,  Table  3.3
provides an overview of the most widely used activities, by channel, for each
step  in  the  “get,  keep,  grow”  process.  In  this  hypothesis  we’ll  focus  on  the
column on the left: the physical channel.

Every  company,  whether  its  product  or  channel  is  physical  or
web/mobile, can summarize its mission in three succinct phrases: build great

products;  “get,  keep,  and  grow”  customers;  and  make  money  directly  or
indirectly from these customers. Customer relationships are the strategies and
tactics to get, keep and grow customers.

Getting customers, sometimes called demand creation, drives customers

into your chosen sales channel(s).

Keeping  customers,  or  retention,  gives  customers  reasons  to  stick  with

the company and product.

Growing customers involves selling them more of what they’ve bought
as  well  as  new  and  different  products  and  encourages  them  to  refer  new
customers.

“Get, Keep and Grow” are among the most
important hypotheses for any startup.

“Get, keep and grow” are among the most important hypotheses for any
startup. You will die without customers and these are most expensive parts of
any company. The diagram in Figure 3.15 provides an overview of the entire
customer relationship life cycle. This hypothesis will “dissect” the diagram,
starting on the left from “awareness,” the first step, and proceeding through
each of the many steps in the “get, keep, grow” process.

PROCEED WITH CAUTION: There is no way you can implement all
this or even process it in one sitting. What follows is an overview of all
the things you need to consider as you shape a marketing strategy that’s
best for your startup.

Developing Customer Relationships in the Physical
Channel

 
 
 
Customer Relationship Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.5)

Think of the “get customers” process as a “funnel” in which the greatest
number  of  potential  customers—those  on  the  left—have  awareness  of  the
product. The number of potential customers declines as their interest grows,
as they consider buying, and then as they make the actual purchase. During
customer  discovery,  you’ll  launch  a  series  of  small-scale,  inexpensive  “get
customers” experiments to determine the tactics that move customers into and
through  the  funnel  in  a  repeatable,  scalable,  and  cost-effective  way.  Later,
once  you  have  customers,  you’ll  begin  customer  retention  activities  to  keep
the customers and use upselling, cross-selling and customer referral programs
to grow the number of customers and the revenue.

“Get Customers”

Getting  customers,  or  demand  creation,  has  four  distinct  stages  in  the
physical  channel:  awareness,  interest,  consideration,  and  purchase.  See
Figure 3.16.

The “Get Customers” Funnel for Physical Goods (Figure 3.16)

PROCEED WITH CAUTION: There is no way you can implement all
these  alternatives  at  once  or  even  process  them  in  one  sitting.  What
follows  is  an  overview  of  all  the  things  you  need  to  consider  as  you
shape a marketing strategy that’s best for you.

 
Awareness lets potential customers know about your product or service
(think TV commercials shouting “new airline” or radio ads saying, “Now you
can fly cheaper”). It gets people thinking about the product or service.

Interest  means  the  message  is  no  longer  being  ignored  even  if  the
prospect isn’t ready to act. Think of people saying, “I should try one of those
low-cost  airlines  sometime,”  as  a  result  of  the  initial  awareness  effort.  One
more push could move this prospect to the consideration step.

Consideration follows interest when the message is powerful enough or
contains a convincing offer that might lead to the thought, “Why don’t I take
JetBlue on my trip to Florida next month?” Consideration may take the form
of a free trial where it’s offered.

Purchase  follows  consideration.  It’s  clearly  the  desired  result  of  “get”

activities.

Creating demand for a consumer electronics product sold on Walmart’s
shelves  is  different  from  opening  a  chain  of  pizza  parlors  or  selling  a  new
type  of  semiconductor.  And  while  the  description  of  customer  relationship
activities  may  seem  simple  at  first,  it’s  actually  the  result  of  a  complex
interplay among customers, the sales channel, the value proposition and the
budget for marketing activities. When you get it right, it all comes together in
a repeatable, scalable, profitable business model.

Develop Your “Get Customers” Strategy

 
Earned and Paid Media Feeding the “Get Customers” Funnel
(Figure 3.17)

The first three funnel stages—awareness, interest, and consideration—happen
in the consumer’s mind, out of reach of anything other than your advertising
messages.  The  first  two  stages—awareness  and  interest—are  out  of  your
control until the customer identifies herself or himself to some channel like a
retailer, a direct-sales rep, or a website and says, “I’m interested.” (This could

happen  when  the  customer  leaves  a  business  card  at  a  trade  show,  requests
more  information  online,  or  talks  with  a  company  representative.)  The  “get
customers” activity moves customers as far into the funnel as possible until
the  customer  self-identifies  and  the  channel  takes  over  the  “consideration”
and “purchase” activity. But it all starts with awareness.

“Get Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.5a)

An  important  caution:  be  aware  of  the  way  the  physical-channel  has
changed in the past decade. Whether a product is sold at a car dealership, a
gravel pit, a 7-Eleven or the trendiest retail boutique, 21st-century consumers
begin  their  search  for  products  online.  So  online  marketing  is  every  bit  as
important  to  marketers  in  the  physical  channel  as  it  is  to  their  web
counterparts. Your job as a marketer is to be sure customers can easily find
your  product  or  service  on  the  web.  This  means  that  physical-channel
marketers  need  to  pay  almost  as  much  attention  to  the  next  section  of  this
chapter—“Web/Mobile Customer Relationships”—as they pay to this one.

(For best results, read both sections before beginning the tasks outlined
here.) Marketers in the physical channel must embrace basic web-marketing

tactics  at  every  opportunity—websites,  AdWords,  online  advertising—even
in the unlikely event that your product isn’t for sale online. Online, your job
is to “pull” customers to your product so they can discover it online, even if
they then buy it at your warehouse, at Walmart or face-to-face from a sales
representative.

Awareness,  interest,  and  consideration  in  the  physical  channel  are
primarily  driven  by  two  types  of  communication  tactics:  earned  (or  free)
media and paid media.

Earned media is the free exposure a company generates. In the physical
channel,  it  includes  press  releases,  product  reviews,  editorial  features  and  a
range  of  “guerrilla  marketing”  tactics  such  as  handing  out  fliers  at  trade
shows  where  the  company  doesn’t  buy  a  booth.  These  tactics  are  often
favored  by  startups  because  they’re  far  less  expensive  than  paid  media
efforts.  Many  consumer  products  find  their  first  customers  through  free
sample or trial programs or by handing out samples or discount coupons on
street corners.

The downside of earned media: unlike paid media, which run on specific
dates and locations, editorial coverage is unpredictable and runs—or doesn’t
—as editorial space or the product’s news value allow.

Online marketing is every bit as important to
marketers in the physical channel as it is to their
web counterparts.

Paid  media  is  exactly  what  it  sounds  like:  media  exposure  that’s
purchased  on  TV,  blimps,  direct  mail  or  the  web.  This  kind  of  activity  can
cost  literally  millions  of  dollars  when  rolled  out,  so  customer  discovery
employs small-scale tests to see which tactic will deliver the best results later,
at product launch.

Other  paid-media  awareness-creation  tactics  that  aren’t  free  include
advertising, trade shows, direct mail, catalogs, events, telemarketing, and in-
store  promotion.  Most  physical-channel  marketers  also  promote  their
products online, of course. During customer discovery your spending will be
low until you successfully test a tactic and prove that it generates leads and
sales cost-effectively.

 
Simple “Get Customer” Tactics to Consider

Build a “get customers”-hypothesis spending spreadsheet that lists:

the free and paid media programs

what the company hopes to achieve and at what cost

Before conducting these or any other tests of customer-relationship
tactics:

     1.  Create a “pass/fail” metric for each “Get” test that defines whether it
worked and should be expanded. An example: will we get one sales
call for every 30 phone calls made to prospects?

     2.  Consider a methodology for improving the results of each test, such as:

If the call blitz doesn’t work, we will e-mail first and then call each
prospect twice.

     3.  Be sure the tests are objectively measurable so that the big spending

decisions that follow aren’t made based on the fact that “it felt good”
or “seems to work well.” JetBlue’s metric for radio ads might seek to
generate reservations-hotline calls at a cost of $1 each. The logic: they
can spend $3 on marketing (sometimes called customer acquisition
cost) to sell a round-trip ticket, and one caller in three buys a ticket on
average.

     4.  Don’t forget that people buy from people. Create, don’t avoid,

opportunities to talk via phone or in person with potential customers.
There are few more powerful sales tools!

Most companies selling through the physical
channel will use a variety of web/mobile marketing
tactics...

     5.  Remember that most companies selling through the physical channel
still use a variety of web/mobile marketing tactics to gain awareness
and sales for their products, so be sure to include elements of
web/mobile “Get” programs from the next section.

 
The  sample  spreadsheet  in  Figure  3.17  charts  the  costs  and  expected
results of the “get” efforts for a startup’s new heavy-duty, $2,500 printer sold
to  businesses  through  office-products  stores.  The  spreadsheet  is  used  to  be
sure the program tests are affordable.

“Keep Customers”

As the “Get” customers exercise clearly illustrates, getting a new customer is
an  expensive  process.  Thus  it’s  important  to  think  now  about  how  the
company  will  keep,  or  retain,  customers  it’s  worked  so  hard  to  get.  When
customers  cancel  a  subscription,  never  return  to  a  supermarket,  or  close  a
corporate purchasing account, it’s called “churn” or “attrition” (the opposite

of retention!).

The “Keep Customers” Funnel (Figure 3.18)

Develop Your “Keep Customers” Strategy

“Keep Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.5b)

For  any  customer  retention  strategy  to  work,  first  the  company  must
deliver  on  all  its  promises  that  got  the  customers  to  buy  in  the  first  place.
Customers  need  to  love  the  product  or  service,  and  every  customer-facing
aspect  of  the  business  model  has  to  perform  exceptionally,  from  customer
service and support to complaint-handling, delivery, billing, and more. First,
a  steady  stream  of  product  upgrades  and  enhancements  should  always  keep
the  product  ahead  of  competition.  By  their  nature,  these  are  core-value-
creation  activities  and  should  be  addressed  in  the  value  proposition
hypothesis.

Next,  begin  to  think  about  programs  that  reach  out  to  customers
proactively to strengthen or bolster retention. This can be as simple as placing
(often  quite  powerful)  outbound  calls  to  be  sure  customers  are  happy  or  as
complex as a multi-tiered loyalty-points program to reward repeat purchases.
In a startup’s early days, it’s hard to test the impact of loyalty programs, since
the results need to be measured over long periods of time.

In a startup’s early days, it’s hard to test the impact
of loyalty programs...

In  addition,  consider  loyalty  programs  such  as  points,  rewards  and
discounts as well as long-term retention incentives like multi-year contracts.
Make  them  part  of  the  hypothesis,  and  test  them  where  possible  during
customer validation.

Finally,  consider  other  parts  of  the  business  model  canvas.  Are  there
things your partners can do to help you keep customers? Other resources you
can use?

Simple  “Keep  Customers”  Tactics  to  Consider:  During  customer
discovery,  put  together  plans  and  then  test  some  basic,  inexpensive  “Keep”
activities to see how they perform. Use the test results to guide future plans in
customer validation and creation. Some simple programs to test and consider:

Loyalty  programs:  How  you  will  use  loyalty  programs  to  retain
customers. Read more about loyalty programs in the customer validation
section and address them in this hypothesis.

Customer check-in calls: Put together a plan to call every customer, or
every  fifth  customer,  once  a  month  or  once  a  quarter  simply  to  thank
them  for  their  business  and  see  how  they  like  the  product.  While  you
have  them  on  the  phone,  probe  for  questions  they  have  about  the
product,  features  or  functions.  (By  the  way,  e-mail  is  still  a  poor
substitute for a voice or Skype connection.) Over time, target at least a
15  percent  improvement  in  repeat  sales  or  renewals  from  customers
who’ve talked.

Launch a customer-satisfaction survey: Whether on the web or by mail
or  e-mail,  plan  to  check  with  customers  about  their  use  of  and
satisfaction with the product or service. (Probe for complaints or lack of
use, and reach out to any who express problems. Look for at least a 15
percent reduction in churn from those who’ve been contacted.)

Send product-update bulletins: Create simple tip sheets or user notes on
how  customers  are  making  the  most  of  the  product.  (Send  them  to  all

 
users, and offer a prize for users whose tips are published later. This is
difficult to measure precisely but inexpensive to implement.)

Monitor  customer-service  issues:  Customers  who  complain  frequently
are most likely to churn. (Get proactive with these customers, fix their
problems, and make them happy. Far fewer complainers should leave if
they’ve had their problems addressed.)

Customer  lock-in/high  switching  costs:  If  it’s  relatively  easy  for  your
customer  to  switch  from  your  products  to  your  competitors’,  you’ll
probably have a higher churn rate. You may want to consider tactics for
“locking  in”  customers  to  your  product  or  solution  (through  long-term
contracts, unique technology, or data that can’t be easily transferred).

It’s 5-10x cheaper to keep a customer than to
acquire one.

Longer-Term  Customer  Retention:  Customer  retention  is  effective  only
when the customers self-identify so they can be contacted by the salesperson,
channel partner, or company representative charged with keeping them happy
and coming back to buy more. As you learn more about individual customers
over time, retention becomes increasingly individualized and targeted based
on the observed and measured customer behavior. This subject is more fully
addressed  during  customer  validation,  when  there  are  more  customers  to
think about keeping.
Specific retention metrics to monitor and act on include:

purchase patterns: volume, frequency, slowdowns or halts

participation  in  “grow  customers”  programs  (described  in  the  next
section)

number  of  complaints  to  customer  service,  refund  requests,  problems,
and the like

participation,  activity  levels,  redemptions  in  loyalty  and  incentive
programs

Retention  programs  live  or  die  by  a  close  monitoring  of  customer

 
behavior to learn who’s staying and who’s leaving and why. You’ll organize
the metrics around “cohorts,” or common groups of customers (such as “new
customers  signed  in  January”).  Three-month  customers,  for  example,  may
behave one way while nine-month customers may be more or less active than
their newer brethren. (This is addressed in detail in the retention-optimization
discussion.)

“Grow Customers”

Once a company has a customer, why not sell them more, since it costs less
than  acquiring  new  customers?  Most  startups  think  only  about  the  revenue
they receive in their first sale to a customer, but smart companies think about
the revenue they can get over the lifetime of the relationship they have with a
customer.  Measuring  customer  lifetime  value  can  be  important  when
computing  a  startup’s  potential.  Describe  how  the  company  will  get  more
revenue  from  its  existing  customer  base  with  programs  that  sell  more  and
encourage customers to refer new ones to the company.

The “Grow Customers” Funnel (Figure 3.20)

Develop a “Grow Customers” Strategy

“Grow Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.5c)

Your “Grow” strategy will have two key components: get the customers you
have  to  buy  more,  and  get  them  to  refer  other  customers  to  you.  A  few
“Grow” tactics only work in the physical channel, such as:

“Upsell” offers such as “spend $25 more and get free shipping”

In-pack promotional mailers of offers, coupons, and samples

Specials or premiums only available to customers who meet with a sales
rep

Direct  mail  is  also  an  effective  customer  growth  tool,  of  course.
Increasingly,  however,  physical  channel  marketers  are  turning  to  online
marketing  rather  than  postal  mail  because  of  its  speed,  lower  cost,  and  the
ability  to  target  better.  You  should  also  study  the  discussion  of  “Grow”
strategy and tactics in the web/mobile section for many more ideas. This will
help  you  shape  your  initial  programs  to  grow  your  customer  base  through
additional sales and referrals.

It’s  difficult  at  this  time  to  think  through  and  test  extensive  “Grow”
customers programs because you have very few customers to test them with.
Far  more  detail  is  provided  in  the  customer  validation  step,  when  there  are
enough customers aboard your “Grow” programs.

Key Resources Hypothesis

This brief identifies external resources critical to the company’s success and
how you’ll find and secure them.

Key resources fall into four main categories: physical, financial, human
and intellectual property.  In  each  relevant  category,  create  a  list  of  the  key
resources you’ll require, what you expect to pay, and where you’ll go to find
them.
Physical  resources:  These  fall  into  two  types:  company  facilities  and
product/service  resources.  Examples  of  company  facilities  are  office  space
and  company  location  (near  mass  transit  to  more  easily  attract  lots  of
employees,  in  a  city  with  great  restaurants,  etc.).  Product/services  may
include a steady supply of superthin silicon wafers or iron ore or thousands of
feet  of  warehouse  space  or  specialized  lab  or  manufacturing  space.  Many
resources  are  capital-intensive,  particularly  where  physical  goods  are
concerned—manufacturing equipment, raw materials, and the like.

...many of the capital-intensive resources have
become utilities or can be outsourced.

In the 21st century, many of the capital-intensive equipment or services
resources  companies  used  to  need  to  physically  own  and  pay  for  have
become  utilities  or  can  be  outsourced.  For  example,  startups  that  need
computing and server capacity can buy processing power and storage, in the
cloud,  from  Amazon.com  and  many  others  (slashing  the  cost  of  a  software
startup  by  a  factor  of  10  or  more).  Manufacturing  that  used  to  be  a  capital-
intensive is now outsourced to Asia (with an equally significant reduction in

 
cost). IT and services can be done cheaper in India, etc.

Financial resources: Money is the lifeblood of startups. You stay in business
until  you  run  out  of  it.  This  book  is  about  how  to  reduce  startup  infant
mortality by making everything you do less wasteful and more cash-efficient.
There  are  tons  of  articles,  websites  and  entire  books  on  how  to  raise
money for a startup—and whom to raise it from. Friends and family, crowd
funding, angels, venture capital and corporate partners are the usual suspects.
But  don’t  overlook  government  grants  as  an  alternative  funding  source  for
new ventures. In the U.S., the grants.gov website is the first stop for a number
of  sources  such  as  SBA  (Small  Business  Administration)  and  SBIR  (Small
Business Innovation Research) grants.

Companies selling physical products have additional sources of capital:

Equipment lease line. This lets you finance the entire purchase price of
business  equipment  or  commercial  vehicles.  Typically  offered  by  a
bank, a lease line can be a great solution whether you need to preserve
working capital for other expenses or you’re in an expansion phase and
need financing

Factoring.  If  you’ve  sold  product  to  a  customer  who  takes  a  while  to
pay, you can sell your accounts receivable (i.e., the invoices) to a third
party  (called  a  factor)  at  a  discount.  It  provides  your  company  with
immediate cash

Vendor financing.  This  is  a  loan  arrangement  that  takes  place  between
your company and a vendor that supplies large volumes of their product
to you. The vendor lends money to you so you can buy products from it

Don’t forget the Human Resources

Human  resources  fall  into  three  categories:  personal  advice  (mentors,
teachers, and coaches), company advisors, and qualified employees.

Teachers,  coaches,  and  mentors  are  people  you’ll  need  to  help  you
advance your personal career. If you want to learn about a specific subject,
find a teacher. If you want to hone specific skills or reach an exact goal, hire
a coach. If you want to get smarter and better over the course of your career,

find someone who cares about you enough to be a mentor.

Advisors  are  people  you’ll  need  to  help  advance  your  company’s
success. Founders fail when they believe their visions are facts. Listening to
advice based on experience can help you sort through whether your vision is
a  hallucination.  Getting  an  advisory  board  (by  expanding  your  circle  of
accumulated  wisdom  beyond  your  investors)  is  so  important  that  it’s  an
explicit step in the Customer Development process.

Qualified  and  motivated  employees  are  the  difference  between  a  good
idea that never goes anywhere and a billion-dollar firm. Will your company
need dozens of specialized engineers or coders or designers as it grows? If so,
where  and  how  will  you  find  them?  Is  your  city  or  location  a  magnet  for
world-class  talent?  Is  there  a  shortage  of  talent?  Will  offshore  teams  be
required as the company scales, and how will you select and manage them?
In more specialized industries (think avionics, chip design, and biotech) this
may  be  even  more  challenging  if  scaling  the  team  quickly  is  important,
especially if the company is headquartered in a smaller or off-the-beaten-path
location to where you’ll have to relocate much of your talent pool in order to
employ  them.  If  you’re  in  a  part  of  the  country  or  the  world  where  the
number of potential employees is limited, how can you be more creative to
get  them?  Identify  what  the  human  resource  needs  are  now  and  what  they
will be two to three years later to be sure that growth won’t be constrained.

Intellectual Property is a Key Resource

Intellectual  property  gives  you  rights  to  stop  others  from  using  your
creativity.  The  assets  you  can  protect  may  include  your  “core  technology,”
such as source code, hardware designs, architecture, processes, and formulas.
Or  it  can  be  your  brand,  logo  or  domain  name.  You  can  protect  business
information,  and  product  roadmaps.
processes,  know-how,  customer 
Protection is also available for content such as music, books, and film. Some
of  these  assets  are  protected  automatically.  For  other  classes,  it’s  wise  and
sometimes mandatory to go through a registration, application or examination
process to get full protection.

Trademark: A trademark protects branding and marks and gives you the
right  to  prevent  others  from  using  “confusingly  similar”  marks  and  logos.
Trademark protection lasts as long as you use the mark. The more you use the
mark, the stronger your protection. Trademark registration is optional but has

significant advantages if approved.

Copyright: A copyright protects creative works of authorship, typically
songs, books, movies, photos, etc. Copyright gives you the right to prohibit
others  from  copying,  distributing  or  making  derivatives  of  your  work.  It
protects  “expressions”  of  ideas  but  doesn’t  protect  the  underlying  ideas.  (If
your  product  is  software,  copyright  is  also  used  to  prohibit  someone  from
stealing  your  software  and  reselling  it  as  machine  and/or  source  code.)
Copyright protection  lasts practically forever. Registration is optional but is
required for suing for infringement.

TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION

Types of Intellectual Property Protection (Table 3.6)

Contract: A contract is a binding legal agreement that’s enforceable in a
court  of  law.  There’s  no  official  registration  process;  you  have  whatever
protection  is  defined  in  the  contract  (e.g.,  a  nondisclosure  agreement  gives
you  certain  rights  to  protection  of  your  confidential  information).  The
protection lasts for the time period defined in the contract.

Patents:  A  patent  is  a  monopoly  the  government  grants  to  prohibit
others  from  making,  using  or  selling  your  invention,  even  when  the  other
party’s infringement is innocent or accidental.

Just  about  anything  can  be  patented—circuits,  hardware,  software,
applied algorithms, formulas, designs, user interfaces, applications, systems.
Scientific  principles  or  pure  mathematical  algorithms  may  not  be  patented.
Your invention must be “nonobvious.” The test for whether it’s nonobvious

is: given the prior art at the time of the invention, would a typical engineer 1)
identify the problem and 2) solve it with the invention? You must be “first to
file.”  You  must  file  in  the  U.S.  within  a  year  of  sale,  offer  for  sale,  public
disclosure  or  public  use.  Your  patent  application  has  to  include  a  written
description  with  details  of  the  claims  of  the  invention.  The  details  have  to
allow  others  to  duplicate  your  invention  from  your  description  and  have  to
use the “best mode” in describing critical techniques/technologies. And it has
to identify all prior “art,” or solutions to the problem.

Patent  protection  typically  lasts  15  to  20  years.  There  is  a  formal
application  and  examination  process.  Each  patent  filing  will  cost  your
company $20,000 to $50,000 and take one to four years to complete. Filing
of  patents  is  frequently  of  major  interest  to  people  funding  your  company.
(There’s something called a “provisional patent” that’s an alternative to a full
patent. It allows you to claim “first to file” and use the term patent pending.
Provisional patents get into the patent office quickly and cheaply. However,
they  automatically  expire  after  one  year,  and  no  patent  rights  are  granted.
Provisional patents are a good placeholder because they’re cheap to file and
don’t get in the way of your other patent efforts.)

Intellectual Property Creates Value

Intellectual  property  is  an  asset  for  your  company.  You  need  to  acquire,
protect  and  exploit  it.  You  can  map  out  an  intellectual  property  strategy  by
asking:

Who are the key players and technologies in its market(s)?

What are the most important ideas and inventions that need patents (or
provisional patents)? Start filing these early!

What are the important patent applications that come next?

Four Common Intellectual Property Mistakes
Startups Make

1.   Founders didn’t make a clean break with previous employer: Do your
employers or university own or have a claim on your inventions? It’s a

very subjective standard, and since startups don’t often have resources or
time to spend on lawsuits, large companies and universities may use
threats of litigation to ensure that you don’t take anything. Therefore the
best advice is to “take only memories.”

2.   Your startup cannot show that it owns its intellectual property: Take the

time to create a clear, well-documented chain of title (think lab
notebooks) to your intellectual property. If you’re using independent
contractors, make sure you have written agreements assigning work
created. Make sure you have Employee Invention Assignment
Agreements. (If you hire subcontractors or friends to do some work, get
assignment agreements as well.)

3.   You lost your patent rights due to filing delays/invention disclosures: In
the U.S., patent rights are forfeited if you wait more than a year after:
     •   disclosure in a printed publication (white paper, journal/conference

article, website)

     •   offer for sale in the U.S. (start of sales effort, price list, price quotation,
trade-show demonstration, any demonstration not under NDA, public
use in the U.S.)

     In most foreign countries, there is no one-year grace period.
4.   Your company grants “challenging” licenses to intellectual property:

Startups acquiring their first customers may give special licensing terms
in key markets, territories, etc.—e.g., a grant of “most favored nations”
license terms or other licensee-favorable economic terms. This can make
your intellectual property less valuable to future buyers of your company.
Or you may cut a deal that you can’t assign or transfer (or can’t get out
of) if you get acquired.

There May be Other Key Resources

Consider  other  external  business  elements  that  are  vital  to  the  company’s
success.  Celebrity  websites  need  a  steady  stream  of  “hot”  gossip  (this  one
shouldn’t be a problem) and  MarthaStewart.com wouldn’t be much without
Martha. Overstock.com would fail without a stream of good-quality discount
merchandise.

Dependency Analysis

The company’s dependency analysis basically answers the question “To sell
our product in volume, what has to happen that’s out of our control?” Things
out  of  a  company’s  control  can  include  other  technology  infrastructure  that
needs  to  emerge  (all  cell  phones  become  web-enabled,  fiber  optics  are  in
every  home,  electric  cars  are  selling  in  volume).  Dependencies  also  include
changes  in  consumers’  lifestyles  or  buying  behavior,  new  laws,  changes  in
economic conditions, and so on. Specify what needs to happen (let’s say the
widespread  adoption  of  telepathy),  when  it  needs  to  happen  (must  be
common among teens by 2020), and what happens if it doesn’t happen (the
product needs to use the Internet instead). Note the benchmarks you’ll use to
measure whether the change is happening when needed.

Identify  all  key  resources  in  this  hypothesis,  and  explain  how  the
company will make sure those key resources are readily available. Be sure to
identify  the  risks  of  their  unavailability,  as  well  as  alternatives  that  will
minimize impact on the company’s business model. Be careful not to confuse
partners (to be discussed next) with resources.

Traffic Partners Hypothesis

  In  addition  to  the  four  types  of  partnerships  in  the  physical  channel
section,  there’s  a  fifth,  vitally  important  type  of  partner  for  web/mobile
startups:  traffic  partners.  Traffic  partners  deliver  people  to  websites  and
mobile apps several ways:

on a “cross referral,” or swapping, basis

on a paid-per-referral basis

by using textlinks, on-site promotions and ads on the referring site

by exchanging e-mail lists

As detailed later in Phase 3 of Customer Validation, these traffic deals
are as difficult to negotiate as they are important. Develop your hypothesis by
identifying  the  target  partners,  what  you  want  them  to  do,  and  how  your
startup will reciprocate in cash or in kind.

Partnerships can sometimes be the lifeblood of a startup. Some examples

to consider in thinking about traffic partnerships of your own:

Zynga,  the  online-gaming  juggernaut,  is  overwhelmingly  dependent  on
its  partnership  with  Facebook,  the  only  place  where  Zynga’s  popular
Farmville  and  other  games  are  played.  Without  the  partnership,  Zynga
would have little traffic or revenue

YouTube got much of its early traffic through a partnership with Google,
so much so that Google bought the company

Salesforce.com drives traffic and revenue to web/mobile sales and CRM

applications through its AppExchange

Mobile apps get much of their traffic from dot.com partners

Niche content retail sites often have similar active partners

Other  partnerships  unique  to  web/mobile  channels  can  also  be  quite
important: App stores and marketplaces are critical partners for mobile apps,
since they’re the apps’ principal channel. (Learn much more about this in the
channels  section.)  Understand  how  they  work,  their  willingness  to  partner,
and the costs. And credit card issuers are often overlooked as partners. They
sometimes  look  askance  at  web  content,  social  networking,  gaming  and  e-
commerce businesses (particularly startups and sellers of web/mobile goods),
since  the  card  issuers  have  been  burned  so  many  times  by  un-scrupulous
entrepreneurs. The result: rigid rules that are often biased against startups.

Identify traffic partners your startup will need initially and as it grows.
Develop a prioritized list of the must-have and best-to-have partners in each
category.  Later,  in  Phase  3  of  Customer  Validation,  you  will  conduct
meetings with prospective partners to determine if they’re interested and what
they will need to make the partnership a mutual success.

Note  to  reader:  These  following  guidelines,  geared  for  physical  channel
startups, are invaluable to web/mobile startups as well.

Partners Hypothesis (Physical)

Key partners often provide capabilities, products, or services that the startup
either  can’t  or  would  prefer  not  to  develop  itself.  Batteries  for  a  flashlight
maker or design services for a website are two simple examples. But the most
famous is Apple and the iPod. Without the record labels providing music as
content,  the  iPod  and  iTunes  would  simply  be  another  hardware/software
player. The partners made the business model the juggernaut it is today.

The key-partners hypothesis names the essential partners your company
will require, along with the “value exchange” with each one (as in “we give
them money, they send us customers”). Partnerships generally fall into four
key  areas:  strategic  alliances;  “coopetition,”  or  cooperation  between
competitors;  joint  new  business  development  efforts;  and  key  supplier
relationships.

Think  of  this  hypothesis  as  a  simple  three-column  spreadsheet.  The
headings:  partner  name  (list  primary  and  runner-up  candidates),  “what  they
provide,”  and  “what  we  provide.”  Don’t  feel  bad  when  the  word  money
appears repeatedly in the third column. It’s fairly typical for startups, at least
in their early days.

Strategic  alliances,  generally  between  noncompetitive  companies,  can
often shorten the list of things your startup needs to build or provide to offer a
complete  product  or  service.  For  physical  products,  alliance  partners  might
provide  product  training,  installation  or  service,  peripherals  or  accessories,
whether  they’re  sold  under  your  startup’s  brand  name  or  not.  Specialized
service firms in many industries (law, accounting, engineering, IT) can often
market  a  wider  range  of  services  by  combining  their  services  with  those  of

other specialists. Alliances can also be used to broaden a startup’s footprint,
making  its  product  more  available  in  geographies  where  the  startup  itself
can’t support sales or service.

Joint  new  business  development  efforts  generally  happen  later  in  a
startup’s  life,  but  can  be  important  once  the  startup  has  established  its  own
identity and brand. Dell and HP sell lots of software and products made by
others,  but  seldom  do  so  until  they’re  confident  the  product  has  significant
consumer demand. Think of these as longer-term opportunities to investigate
as part of your customer discovery process.

“Coopetition” similarly happens later in a startup’s life, as a rule. It’s a
form of working with a direct competitor to share costs or market together.
New  York  City’s  “fashion  week”  is  a  good  example  of  coopetition  for
established  fashion  houses.  While  they’re  fiercely  competitive,  they  work
together to coordinate fashion show schedules so the top buyers can attend all
the key showings. Word for Mac is perhaps the greatest coopetition example
of all time, but both companies were well-established before the product was
developed and launched.

Key supplier relationships can mean life or death for a startup. Imagine
how tough it would be to churn out millions of iPhones without Foxconn, the
massive  Apple  manufacturing  partner  in  China,  or  to  make  Ben  &  Jerry’s
famed  Cherry  Garcia  without  an  uninterrupted  supply  of  delicious  cherries.
Suppliers  can  be  instrumental  to  any  company’s  success,  but  tight,  flexible
partnerships can be absolutely critical. Many startups outsource a variety of
“back  office”  functions,  ranging  from  warehousing  and  fulfillment  of
physical  goods  to  HR,  payroll,  benefits  and  accounting.  These  outsource
suppliers  act  as  extensions  of  the  company  that  leverage  the  suppliers’
expertise to improve the startup’s efficiency and cost structure.

Will  the  partner  flex  its  delivery  times,  order-size  requirements,  credit
terms  or  even  its  price  in  your  startup’s  early  days?  How  will  the  partner
ensure  a  steady  supply  that  rises  (quickly,  we  hope)  or  falls  in  line  with
customer  demand?  Identify  the  key  suppliers  in  this  hypothesis,  along  with
what  you’ll  need  from  them.  You’ll  visit  with  them  later  to  validate  this
hypothesis  and  understand  your  role  and  theirs  in  forging  a  mutually
beneficial relationship.

Revenue and Pricing Hypothesis

The  revenue  and  pricing  brief  may  well  be  the  toughest  of  all,  but  it’s
critically important, since it ensures that the business model makes financial
sense.  In  a  way,  this  brief  is  elegantly  simple,  since  it  asks  only  four
questions:

1.  How many of these things will we sell?

2.  What’s the revenue model?

3.  How much will we charge?

4.  Does this add up to a business that’s worth doing?

Revenue Sources, (Figure 3.20)

While some of the issues differ from channel to channel, the process of
computing your company’s revenue is fundamentally the same, regardless of
channel. The good news: much of the work for this brief is already complete.

Question 1: How Many Will We Sell?

In the physical channel, companies generate revenue by selling their product,
collecting  revenue  either  as  a  one-time  sale,  via  time  payments,  or  through
such  financial  tools  as  leasing  or  subscriptions.  They  also  solicit  referrals
from current customers, often rewarding customers for referring others.

Collect 
completed earlier:

the  following  revenue  stream  components  from  hypotheses

Market  size  and  market  share  hypotheses,  which  should  translate  into
the  anticipated  number  of  customers  (as  in  10  percent  of  a  million-
person market = 100,000 customers)

Channel hypotheses, along with estimates of their volume potential and
channel costs

Be  sure  to  include  (subtract,  really)  the  channel’s  cost  of  sales,  which
can be enormous, since the company only gets to “count,” or keep, net
revenue  received  after  channel  costs  are  subtracted.  (Enthusiastic
entrepreneurs make this mistake far too often)

 Question 2: What’s the Revenue Model?

Web  and  mobile  products  in  particular  have  a  wider  variety  of  potential
revenue  sources  than  their  physical  channel  cousins.  (Product  sales  are  the
prime  revenue  source  for  physical  products.)  Direct  revenue  sources  to
review and estimate include:

Sales: Product, app, or service sales are the principal revenue source for
many web/mobile startups, typically in a one-time transaction that may
also lead to follow-on sales

Subscriptions: Software, games, and other online products are often sold
by a monthly subscription

Pay-per-use: Some web products (travel sites and eBay are two simple
examples)  earn  revenue  on  a  “per  use”  basis,  with  subscription  or
discounted volume purchases optional

Other web/mobile resources may include:

Referral  revenue:  payments  for  referring  traffic  or  customers  to  other
web/mobile sites or products

Affiliate revenue (revenue sharing):  finder’s  fees  or  commissions  from
other (typically e-commerce) sites for directing customers to them

E-mail  list  rentals:  subscription  and  membership  sites  often  rent  their
customer e-mail lists to carefully selected advertiser partners

Back-end offers:  add-on  sales  from  other  companies  offered  as  part  of
registration or purchase confirmation processes,

When it comes to advertising sales, two fundamental rules apply. First,
the  more  distinctive,  unusual,  or  hard  to  reach  an  audience  actually  is,  the
more a marketer will pay to reach it. Private pilots or people who travel on
private  jets  are  far  more  valuable  than  “travelers,”  and  “active  multiplayer
gamers” are worth considerably more than teens.

Rule number two: very few marketers or advertisers will be interested in
small  audiences,  even  if  the  product  or  site  is  destined  for  huge  audiences
down  the  road.  The  “friction”  costs  of  research,  contracts,  and  paperwork
required just to reach a few thousand (or sometimes half a million) people is
often  just  not  worth  it  to  an  advertiser.  Research  this  question  with
prospective  revenue  sources  and  factor  the  responses  into  the  revenue
calculation.

Question 3: How Much Do We Charge? (Pricing
Tactics)

This is a two-part question. Part one assesses the costs of doing business. For
physical  products,  this  is  often  far  more  important.  If  you’re  selling  canned
peas or microwave relay towers, there’s a clear, sizeable cost of the physical
product itself: parts, assembly, packaging, shipping, and more.

In  business-to-business  and  some  consumer  sales,  other  issues  warrant
consideration, such as total cost of operation (if rent is high or staff is huge,
or the electric bill is a high component of product cost).

Part two of the “how much will we charge” question is simple: “what’s
the price?” You will start testing your pricing hypothesis later in discovery,
but first there’s a bit more work to do.

A  good  pricing  model  recognizes  Market  Type,  accommodates
manufacturing  costs,  the  value  the  product  delivers,  market  beliefs,  and
competitive  prices.  It  also  charges  “as  much  as  the  market  will  bear”  to
maximize  profits.  For  best  results,  start  with  a  deep  understanding  of
competitive pricing.

  In  web/mobile  channels,  pricing  is  much  more  transparent  and
almost  always  easily  found  online,  which  heightens  the  need  to  monitor
competitive pricing.

Startups  have  lots  of  choices  in  selecting  their  pricing  models.  Among

the most popular pricing models:

Value pricing: Based on the value delivered by the product rather than
the  cost  itself.  Investing  or  accounting  software  tools,  unique  patented
products and pharmaceuticals can sometimes optimize profits with this
model

Competitive  pricing:  Positions  the  product  against  others  in  its
competitive set, typically in existing markets

Volume pricing: Designed to encourage multiple purchases or users, in
situations ranging from office supplies to SAAS software

Portfolio  pricing:  For  companies  with  multiple  products  and  services,
each  with  a  different  cost  and  utility.  Here  the  objective  is  to  make
money with the portfolio, some with high markups and some with low,
depending on competition, lock-in, value delivered, and loyal customers

The  “razor/razor  blade”  model:  Part  of  the  product  is  free  or
inexpensive, but it pulls through highly profitable repeat purchases on an
ongoing basis. (Think of the cost of ink-jet printers compared with the
cost of the ink.) Often challenging for startups due to the upfront cost

Subscription: While now thought of as a software strategy, the Book of
the Month Club pioneered this for physical products

Leasing:  Lowers  the  entry  cost  for  customers.  Provides  constant
earnings over a period of years

Product-based  pricing:  Based  on  a  multiple  of  actual  product  cost.
Usually 
for  maximum
revenue/profit versus volume)

for  physical  goods. 

(Typically  priced 

 This calculus is very different for a web/mobile product, where the
incremental  cost  of  a  new  customer  is  practically  zero,  as  it  is  for  a
multiplayer game app that adds, say, 50 new customers to its system at a cost
measured, at most, in pennies per customer.

Two Business-to-Business Pricing Issues

Total Cost of Ownership/Adoption (TCO): More an issue in business than
in consumer sales, the TCO analysis estimates the total cost to customers of
buying  and  using  the  product.  For  business  products,  do  customers  need  to
buy  a  new  computer  to  run  the  software?  Do  they  need  training  to  use  the
product? Do other physical or organizational changes need to happen? What
will  deployment  across  a  whole  company  cost?  For  consumer  products,
measure  the  cost  of  “adopting”  the  product  to  fit  consumer  needs.  Do
customers need to change their lifestyle? Do they need to change any part of
their purchasing or usage behavior? Do they need to throw away something
they use today?

Return  on  Investment  (ROI):  When  setting  prices  for  sales  to
corporations,  your  company  may  have  to  prove  to  them  the  purchase  price
was “worth it,” or that they got “a good deal,” which may be less about price
than  about  the  total  return  on  their  investment.  As  a  rule,  companies  focus
more on ROI than consumers do, partly because of the size of and oversight
on  large  transactions.  ROI  represents  customers’  expectation  of  their
investment  measured  against  goals  such  as  problem-solving,  productivity,
time,  money  and  resources.  For  consumers,  return  often  includes  status  or
style and sometimes even just plain fun.

When  selling  to  businesses,  prepare  a  hypothetical  ROI  in  advance  of
initial  customer  meetings.  (This  is  often  a  good  subject  for  a  helpful  white
paper.) If the solution doesn’t return a meaningful multiple ROI, sales may be
difficult.  That  $50,000  robot  vacuum  system  as  a  replacement  for  a  $5,000
annual  cleaning  bill  may  be  a  tough  sell,  especially  after  a  good  job  on  the
TCO  (maintenance,  electricity,  parts  and  more)  as  part  of  the  ROI
computation.

Question 4: Do Revenues Point to a Business Worth
Doing?

You have to do more than multiply the volume by the average selling price to
get the answer to this question, but don’t worry—this answer doesn’t need to
be precise just yet. Remember, the goal of customer discovery is to refine a
business model enough to test it on a larger scale in the next step, customer
validation. So at this point, with a rough view of the gross revenue and all the
fixed  and  variable  costs  involved,  make  a  rough  computation  of  the
following:

Is the revenue adequate to cover costs in the short term?

Will the revenue grow materially if not dramatically over time?

Does the profitability get better as the revenues get bigger?

Again,  this  is  a  rough,  back-of-the-envelope  calculation  used  only  to
decide  if  what  you  found  in  discovery  moves  your  forward  to  customer
validation. It’s not an accounting exercise.

Web/mobile markets are often multi-sided.

 How Single and Multi-Sided Markets Affect

Financials

Companies  with  physical  products  most  often  have  “single-sided”  markets:
customers who buy the one product the company makes.

Web/mobile markets are often multi-sided. When a web/mobile startup
plans  to  first  focus  on  amassing  huge  numbers  of  users,  eyeballs,  or  clicks
and to “figure out the revenue model later,” this implies a multi-sided market.
Multi-sided markets have a different business model for each side of the
market. Typically, the business model components that change include value
proposition, customer segment, customer relationships and revenue stream.

One  side,  the  users,  is  measured  in  eyeballs,  page  views,  referrals,  or
hours  rather  than  dollars.  The  other  side  of  the  market,  the  customers,
consists  of  advertisers  who  pay  to  reach  the  users.  Hundreds  of  millions  of
Facebook  users  think  of  it  as  a  free  social  network,  and  indeed,  Facebook
makes its money from a completely different customer segment (advertisers)

 
with  a  completely  different  value  proposition  through  a  different  channel
(direct sales and online self-service).

Calculate  the  revenue  model  for  that  second  side  of  the  market—the
payers—right  now.  Understanding  what  an  advertiser  is  willing  to  pay  to
reach your startup’s audience is vital to the business model.

Remember, you have limited resources. Focus first on the one key, big
source  of  revenue  before  expanding  into  secondary  sources,  which  can  be
distracting to the company.

Two More Revenue Issues to Consider

Distribution  Channel  Affects  Revenue  Streams.  Calculating  revenue  is
easy for a product sold directly by your own sales force: You simply deduct
any discount you gave the customer from the list price of the product. When
you  sell  through  indirect  channels,  revenue  calculations  might  be  harder.
Selling  to  Walmart  is  wonderful,  but  most  retails  channels  have  “return
rights.”  (If  your  product  doesn’t  move  off  their  shelf,  you  have  to  take  it
back.) Are you selling to OEMs where the discount is steep and the revenue
to your company doesn’t appear until the OEM begins selling in volume?
Consider Lifetime Value: How much will the customer ultimately spend not
just  in  the  first  sale  but  over  the  life  of  his  or  her  relationship  with  the
company?  SAAS  software,  dating  websites,  and  online  gaming  focus  on
customer  lifetime  value.  Customers  can  sign  up  for  salesforce.com,  for
example,  sometimes  for  a  few  dollars  a  month,  but  the  company  no  doubt
spends  several  times  that  amount  to  attract  and  sign  a  new  user.  Why?
Because  it  understands  that  the  average  salesforce.com  subscription  lasts
many months, making the new customer worth a multiple of the monthly cost
—provided,  of  course,  that  the  company  stays  in  business  long  enough  to
collect  the  revenue.  (On  the  other  hand,  the  lifetime  value  of  a  demolition
contractor’s typical customer often approximates his first invoice.)

Customer lifetime value dramatically affects revenue stream and pricing
strategy,  online  or  off,  although  other  than  magazine  and  newspaper
subscriptions,  which  are  declining  rapidly,  there  are  scant  few  subscription
products beyond gym memberships among physical products.

Final Draft of a Business Model Hypothesis (Figure 3.21)

Tie the Components of Revenue Together in a
Hypothesis

Revenue stream and pricing interact with the value proposition, the channel,
customer  relationships,  and  the  other  business  model  components.  That
means  there’ll  be  lots  of  iterating  and  pivoting.  The  revenue  stream
hypothesis will be tested repeatedly before it’s cast in stone, first in customer
discovery  discussions  and  again  with  more  customers  as  part  of  customer
validation. When the draft of the revenue stream brief is complete, re-validate
it to see that the math adds up. Ultimately, only one answer matters: can we
generate enough revenue, profits and growth to make this business worth our
time and energy?

Completing the Hypothesis Development Process:

This brief completes the company’s only large-scale paperwork exercise. The
action  now  moves  outside  the  building  so  you  can  start  to  understand  what
potential  customers  need  and  to  qualify  or  refine  the  initial  hypothesis
assumptions. But before doing that:

Convene a team meeting where a large copy of the latest business model

canvas and briefs are taped to a wall. A summary of each of the briefs
should be adjacent to the canvas

All participants should read each of the business model briefs

Look  at  the  summaries  on  the  canvas,  read  the  details  in  the  briefs,
discuss 
look  for  obvious  conflicts  or
inconsistencies.

them  as  a 

team,  and 

Founders,  product  development,  engineering  and  operations  teams
should again validate cost assumptions and changes

Return to the first hypotheses developed to be certain there’s no conflict
from one to the next. Does the sales channel make sense, for example, in
light of the pricing, need for installation, etc.? Will fewer customers still
adequately fund overhead and development?

Review and agree on the final versions of each hypothesis

Make certain the hypothesis summaries agree with the summary in the
appropriate business model box

Update the business model as appropriate

Now it’s time to move ahead and get out of the office, where customers

and facts live.

Customer Discovery, Phase Two: “Get Out
of the Building” to Test the Problem: “Do
People Care?”

PHASE 2 GETS  THE  TEAM  “OUT  OF  THE  BUILDING” to test the problem and to
answer three key questions:

Do we really understand the customer’s problem?

Do  enough  people  really  care  enough  about  the  problem  for  this  to
become a huge business?

And will they care enough to tell their friends?

The next section, Phase 3, will test to see whether the product offers a
compelling solution to customers who have said there’s a problem. When the
“problem”  and  “solution”  questions  are  answered  with  a  resounding  “yes,”
product/market  fit  is  achieved  and  it’s  time  to  move  on  to  customer
validation.

  This  problem  phase  is  markedly  different  for  web/mobile  startups,
where product development time is far shorter and feedback comes far faster.
Problem discovery is conducted with the development of a low-fidelity MVP
website  or  mobile  app.  Sometimes  as  simple  as  a  PowerPoint  diagram  or  a
single web page, this early MVP helps gather immediate feedback about the
problem. Later, the solution is tested with a hi-fidelity MVP.

This phase includes five key steps:

designing experiments for customer tests

preparing for customer contacts and engagement

testing  customers  understanding  of  the  problem  and  assessing  its
importance to customers

gaining understanding of customers

capturing competitive and market knowledge

As  this  phase  gets  under  way,  here’s  a  reminder  of  the  key  rules  from

the Customer Development Manifesto in Chapter 1:

Customer discovery is done by the founders

Hypotheses require testing. Testing requires experiments to be designed

Web  surveys  are  nice,  but  always  correlate  them  with  face-to-face
customer feedback, even for web businesses

Customer  meetings  aren’t  about  learning  whether  customers  love  the
product,  at  least  not  yet.  They’re  about  understanding  the  problem  and
how  urgently  your  potential  customers  need  to  solve  that  problem.
You’ll focus more on the product itself once you’re certain the problem
it solves is big enough to create a market worth going after

Initial hypotheses rarely survive feedback without iterations or pivots

Design Tests and Pass/Fail Experiments

At  this  point,  your  Phase  One  business  model  hypotheses  are  still  just
“guesses.” In this phase you’ll turn those hypotheses into facts by getting out
of the building and testing them in front of customers.

Here’s  an  easy  way  to  visualize  this:  think  of  a  three-layer  business
model.  The  bottom  layer  represents  your  initial  vision  of  the  startup.  The
second  layer  outlines  the  detailed  hypotheses  you  just  developed  in  Phase

One.  The  third  layer  shows  the  tests  you’ll  conduct  to  verify  and  measure
each  hypothesis,  turning  guesses  into  facts  as  you  do,  so  that  the  business
model can be verified and measured.

Business Model/Hypotheses/Tests (Figure 4.1)

But  how  do  you  test?  Rule  number  6  of  the  Customer  Development
Manifesto  says  to  design experiments  and  Rule 9  says  to  do  it  with  speed,
tempo and fast cycle time. So the first step in running a test of your business
model  hypotheses  is  to  design  simple  pass/fail  experiments  for  each  test.
Next you run the tests, and then you gather the data and not only try to learn
something  from 
insight.  The
Hypotheses/Experiment/Test/Insight loop is shown in Figure 4.2 below.

to  gain  some 

test  but  also 

the 

try 

Hypothesis/Design Experiment/Test/Insight (Figure 4.2)

Regardless of whether it’s a physical or web/mobile product, Customer
Development experiments are short, simple, objective pass/fail tests. You’re
looking for a strong signal in the noise. The pass/fail tests give you a “good
enough” signal to proceed.

Start by asking yourself, “What do I want to learn?” Then ask, “What’s
the simplest pass/fail test I can run to learn?” Finally, think about, “How do I
design a pass/fail experiment to run this simple test?”

For  example,  a  Customer  Relationships  hypothesis  for  a  physical

product  may  have  assumed  that  for  every  10  sales  calls  three  people  would
move into active consideration of buying. The experiment might be as simple
as making the same presentation to 30 prospects and having the experiment
“pass” by coming away with nine or more orders or letters of intent.

  A  web  business  model  hypotheses  for  Customer  Relationships  and
Revenue Model may have assumed that you can acquire 5,000,000 customers
by  spending  $1  million  on  Google  AdWords.  Your  pass/fail  experiment
might  take  the  form  “we  believe  we  can  acquire  visitors  with  Google
AdWords at a cost of 20 cents per click.” Your experiment would create three
different 
to  each,  and
sequentially testing each landing page (using the same AdWords) every other
day. A “pass” would get 2,500 clicks per page. Anything less, the hypotheses
failed. (A secondary test that falls out of this is which page got the customers
the fastest!)

landing  pages,  allocating  $500 

in  AdWords 

Most of the time you can mock up the web page or
create a demo or prototype to elicit valuable
learning.

Tests

One  of  the  things  that  trips  up  engineering  founders  is  thinking  that  these
hypotheses tests have to be actual code, hardware or the real product. Most of
the  time  you  can  mock  up  the  web  page  or  create  a  demo  or  physical
prototype to elicit valuable learning. Nor do the tests involve large sums of
money or large amounts of time. When you get a strong “grab it out of your
hands” on, say, from four of your first ten customers, it’s OK to stop the test
and declare it a success. The goal is speed, learning and looking for a global
maximum (not a local maximum).

What’s a global maximum? Let’s say you run a free trial offer for three
days on your great new weekend getaway website and you get 50, then 60,
then  80  signups  in  the  first  three  days.  You  might  say,  “Wow,  80,  that’s
great,” and end the test. But on day four, the sun comes out. Had you run the

 
test  for  only  two  more  days,  you  might  have  discovered  your  “global
maximum,” 500 signups a day. Only experience and good guesswork can tell
you how long to run a test, and while shorter is always better, be sure you’ve
given yourself the opportunity to reach your global maximum.

Global Maximum versus Local Maximum Response Rates (Figure 5.3)

The  next  steps  in  Phases  2  and  3  and  in  customer  validation  provide

details on how to set up tests for both web/mobile and physical products.

Insight

The goal of these experiments/tests is not just to collect customer data. Nor is
it to simply get “pass” on the pass/fail experiments. And it’s not just to learn
something, though we hope you will.

It’s 

something  more  profound, 

intangible  and  what  makes
entrepreneurship in the end still an art. It’s the fact that you’re looking past
the  data  –  you’re  looking  for  insight.  Did  you  get  thrown  out  of  sales  calls
time and again but you remembered someone said, “Too bad you don’t sell x,
because we can use a ton of those.”

Build Your Low Fidelity MVP

  The  tests  to  qualify  your  web/mobile  business  model  hypotheses  will
have you engage thousands of customers in discussions about their problem
or need. You’ll do this by developing a low fidelity minimum viable product
that answers two critical questions: do you understand the customer problem
or need, and when you do, do lots of customers care?

This  low  fidelity  MVP  test  makes  sure  the  problem  or  need  your

company will address is an urgent one for customers.

You’ll build the low fidelity MVP in this step and run the actual tests in

the next step.

The Low Fidelity MVP Strategy

As discussed in Phase 1, the low fidelity MVP can be as simple as a landing
page  with  your  value  proposition,  benefits  summary,  and  a  call  to  action  to
learn more, answer a short survey, or preorder. Or it can be a quick web-site
prototype  in  PowerPoint  or  built  with  a  simple  landing-page  creation  tool.
More experienced web developers can build a functional user interface with a
wireframe  prototyping  tool  and  build  a  working  low-fidelity  website.  No
matter  what,  this  is  a  very  basic  website  without  fancy  U/I,  logos,  or
animation.

Get  the  MVP  live  as  quickly  as  possible  (often  the  day  you  start  the
company)  to  see  if  anybody  shares  your  vision  of  the  customer  need/
problem. Start with a low-fidelity website that:

describes the problem’s severity in words or pictures (“Does your office

look like this?”)

describes the problem, encouraging users to “sign up to learn more”

shows screen shots of the solution (“pay your bills this way”)

Consider other simple MVP components like a YouTube video showing
or discussing the problem, a short online survey on the issue, or a blog asking
visitors their opinion.

In  the  next  step,  you’ll  invite  consumers  to  respond  as  thoroughly  as
possible,  giving  them  several  options  for  doing  so.  Start  by  asking  for  a
response  as  simple  as  signing  up  to  learn  more.  The  next  most  important
measure  is  whether  they’ll  rush  to  tell  lots  of  their  friends,  which  tests  the
visitor’s  view  of  the  importance  or  magnitude  of  the  problem,  or  the
excitement around the thought of a new online game, for example.

The third step invites more detailed feedback via an e-mail or a survey
tool  or  by  asking  the  viewer  if  she’d  welcome  a  call  to  discuss  the  new
product  or  company.  Remember:  the  more  a  visitor  is  asked  to  do,  the  less
likely  it  is  she  will  respond.  So  be  sure  to  have  the  simplest,  most  basic
response mechanism—like “sign up to learn more”—most prominent on the
MVP.

The tools listed in this section are examples. That are not recommended
or  preferred,  just  representative  of  what’s  available.  New  tools  appear
daily. Do your homework and check www.steveblank.com for the latest

How to Build a Low Fidelity MVP

For non-coders:

Make a quick prototype in PowerPoint or use Unbounce, Google Sites,
Weebly, Godaddy, WordPress or Yola

 
 
For surveys and preorder forms, Wufoo and Google Forms can easily be
embedded within your site with minimal coding

For coders (tips for building the user interface):

Pick a website wireframe prototyping tool (i.e. JustinMind, Balsamiq)

99 Designs is great for getting “good enough” graphic design and web
design  work  for  very  cheap  using  a  contest  format.  Themeforest  has
great designs

Create wireframes and simulate your low-fidelity website

Create  a  fake  sign-up/order  form  to  test  customer  commitment.
Alternatively,  create  a  “viral”  landing  page,  with  LaunchRock  or
KickoffLabs

Embed a slide show on your site with Slideshare, or embed a video tour
using YouTube or Vimeo

Do user interface testing with Usertesting or Userfy

By the way, don’t underestimate the long-term value of design and the
importance of user interface. At times even friends and relatives would look
askance at an MVP that’s so crude it seems like the person who created it is
totally out of his depth. But the goal at this stage is not U/I perfection. It is to
test  a  problem.  It  could  be  done  with  a  sock-puppet  if  the  test  were  set  up
correctly.

Consider Using Multiple MVPs

Many  startups  develop  multiple  low-fidelity  websites  to  test  different
problem descriptions. For example, a simple online accounts payable package
can  be  simultaneously  tested  three  different  ways:  as  fastpay,  ezpay,  and
flexipay.  Each  addresses  three  different  accounts  payable  problems—speed,
ease  of  use,  and  flexibility.  Each  landing  page  would  be  different,  stressing
the “ease of use” problem, for example. As a simple test of the problem, first
buy Google AdWords for each URL and present the problem three different
ways, in the AdWords space and on the landing page. Next, you would rotate
the  listings  so  each  is  on  top  of  the  Google  stack  exactly  one-third  of  the

time.  (If  nobody  clicks,  return  to  the  start  of  this  chapter.)  Which  approach
generates  the  most  clicks?  Which  yields  the  most  sign-ups?  The  most
referrals?

In the next step, you’ll turn on the low fidelity MVP you’ve built, and

see what happens in the next step. Good luck!

Low Fidelity MVP Problem Test

 Now it’s time to see if anybody cares about the problem you’re solving or
the need you’re fulfilling. It’s time to gradually invite people to the MVP you
built in the previous step, see how they respond, and measure how and what
they do.

WARNING!!  PROCEED  WITH  CAUTION.  This  step  should  be
taken gradually, as your new product is meeting the public for the first
time. Please resist the temptation to “go live” until you’ve read the next
few pages.

Just  because  the  MVP  is  live  doesn’t  mean  anyone  will  find  it
(remember that the web is a vast place with zillions of sites). So start inviting
people to experience the MVP (at most, a few hundred at a time). Follow the
plan  outlined  in  your  “get  customers”  hypothesis,  accelerating  the  pace  of
customer  acquisition  slowly  and  watching  every  action  or  inaction  closely.
After all, this is the first time your product hypotheses will actually meet real
customers, and the learning is likely to be intense.

Some of your hypotheses might be shot down in flames in the first hour
or  two.  For  example,  most  entrepreneurs  would  change  something  if  they
invited 50 friends to an MVP “problem” page and not a single one clicked or
signed  up.  Imagine  your  surprise  if  you  bought  a  list  of  1,000  mothers  of
toddlers and three just accepted your invitation to join “toddlermom.com.”

The customer relationships hypothesis developed in Phase 1 details how

 
 
you’ll “get” potential customers to the MVP, app, or site. Review it and take
mini-bites of several acquisition and activation tactics you believe will bring
you  hordes  of  customers.  (Think  of  each  tactic  you’re  planning  as  a  jug  of
fuel. Start with an eye-dropper full and check the results. If they look good,
as  outlined  in  your  hypothesis,  pour  in  a  tablespoon,  a  pint,  or  maybe  a
quart.)  Remember  that  this  is  a  small-scale  test  to  determine  whether  your
startup is solving a problem or need that customers care a great deal about.

There are three basic ways to invite people to engage on your site, and

you should likely use all three: push, pull or pay.

Push people toward your site or app by using e-mails, their friends, or
social media to get them there; pull them with SEO and pay-per-click or other
devices;  and  pay  is  just  what  it  says—buy  lists,  clicks,  or  other  tools  that
deliver eyeballs.

“Push” Contacts Need Referral Sources: Reach out to friends and contacts
using  e-mails,  texts,  and  social  messaging  tools  such  as  Twitter,  Facebook
and  LinkedIn.  Encourage  them  to  e-mail  friends  and  colleagues  and  to  use
their  Twitter,  Facebook,  Google+  and  LinkedIn  accounts  to  reach  as  many
other people as possible. Obtain the longest possible list of e-mail addresses.
Worry less about the details in these efforts and more about getting a big list.
An invitation always works better when it comes from someone known to the
recipient.

Provide  a  draft  message  your  friends  can  use  when  reaching  out  on
behalf of the company. It should express support for the idea and the value of
exploring the problem. The e-mail should be short and as personal as possible
and should indicate a strong relationship between founder and sender.

“Pull” Strategies: Pull can be ads, textlinks or AdWords and natural search
driving people to the MVP, app or site. Pull solves three problems:

There’s no need to cajole everyone for e-mail addresses

Only people interested in the issue, problem or need will respond

People who are pulled are more likely to respond, perhaps repeatably

Here are some ways to pull people into the discussion:

Google AdWords

display ads or textlinks on social networks (Facebook, et al.) or relevant
websites

press releases with links to a survey or site about the problem

getting bloggers to blog about the problem and invite commentary

exploring the many online feedback tools available

“Pay”  for  Contacts:  Buy  lists  of  targeted  business  or  consumer  prospects.
Typically the least attractive startup option for obvious (cash) reasons, this is
usually the fastest option. A few to consider:

     E-mail lists: Buy permission-based e-mail lists. The more narrow or
focused the targeting, the greater the cost. Response rates are still
challenging with this approach

     Online survey tools: Buy a package of respondents, survey design,

implementation and a guaranteed number of targeted responses from one
of many suppliers such as Markettools

     Established mobile data vendors: Vendors with credentials, high-quality
clients and high ethical standards are a must in this channel. Check
references thoroughly, since it’s easy to violate federal laws

     Hire a publication: Some trade and online media will survey their readers
for you at a cost. It’s expensive but helps with targeting and response
because of the medium’s credibility

Missteps to Avoid when Testing the Low Fidelity MVP:

Customer discovery slips from the hands of founders and becomes a task
for specialists (consultants, employees, etc.)

Comments are summarized, averaged, and amalgamated, which tends to
blur  or  hide  the  most  distinct  “outlier”  comments  that  often  lead  to
iterations and pivots

National laws on mobile messaging and privacy need to be understood
and respected. Penalties are substantial

Online  tools  provide  very  little  chance  for  context  and  dialogue  that
“drill down” in key discovery areas

As a rule, people pay far less attention when filling out online surveys
than they do in face-to-face conversation

Online feedback is not a substitute for leaving the building and talking
directly  to  customers,  some  of  whom  can  be  initially  identified  online.
Don’t let online interaction stand alone

You Don’t Have Real Data Until You See Their
Pupils Dilate

People  lie  on  the  web.  And  if  you’re  depending  only  on  web  data,  you’ll
never  know  it.  Correlate  response  you  get  online  with  “ground  truth.”  The
best way to do that is to interview some of the sources of your web data in
person. You don’t have real data until you’ve seen their pupils dilate.

In  addition,  in-person  interviews  can  test  how  well  your  MVP  is
explaining the need or problem, particularly if you show the customer several
MVPs and learn which they like best and why. Can the customer “play back”
the value proposition or problem statement after a brief explanation? Do they
get  palpably  excited,  or  do  they  politely  meander  through  the  discussion?
Talk  about  how  extensively  this  problem  affects  their  friends  or  coworkers
and whether they’d be likely to buy a problem that solves it. Keep a close ear
to the ground for outliers and comments like “It’d be much more important if
you did this” or “Isn’t that the same as product x, which never works right?”
Those  one-off  comments  are  where  pivots  and  iterations  in  the  business
model are most often found.

Drive Traffic and Start Counting

As  soon  as  you  can,  begin  e-mailing,  Tweeting,  calling,  and  inviting
everyone you know to come visit and react to the MVP. One of the strategies
of a web or mobile app is to instrument the product and measure and analyze
everything.  Use  web  analytics  to  track  hits,  time  spent  on-site,  and  source.
For  your  initial  site,  Google  Analytics  may  provide  adequate  information
with the fastest setup. Once you’ve moved beyond your initial MVP, you’ll
want to consider a more advanced analytic platform (Kissmetrics, Mixpanel,
to  measure  user  satisfaction
Kontagent,  etc.).  Create  an  account 

(GetSatisfaction, UserVoice, etc.) with your product and to get feedback and
suggestions on new features.

Measure  how  many  people  care  about  the  problem  or  need  and  how
deeply  they  care.  The  most  obvious  indicator  is  the  percentage  of  invitees
who  register  to  learn  more.  Next  you  need  to  learn  if  visitors  think  their
friends  have  the  same  need  or  problem,  so  include  widgets  for  forwarding,
sharing and Tweeting the MVP.

Focus on the conversion rates. If the MVP got 5,000 page views and 50
or 60 sign-ups, it’s time to stop and analyze why. If 44 percent of the people
who  saw  an  AdWord  or  textlink  to  the  MVP  signed  up,  you’re  almost
certainly on to something big. What percentage of people invited to the test
actually came? What percentage of people in each test (a) provided their e-
mail  address,  (b)  referred  or  forwarded  the  MVP  to  friends,  or  (c)  engaged
further in a survey, blog, or other feedback activity? Of those who answered
survey  questions,  how  many  declared  the  problem  “very  important”  as
opposed to “somewhat important?”

Specific  questions,  such  as  “Is  there  anything  preventing  you  from
signing  up?”  or  “What  else  would  you  need  to  know  to  consider  this
solution?”  tend  to  yield  richer  customer  feedback  than  generic  feedback
requests.  If  possible,  collect  e-mail  addresses  so  you  have  a  way  to  contact
people for more in-depth conversations.

A  powerful  way  to  test  a  problem  uses  the  Net  Promoter  Score™,
developed  by  Satmetrix  as  a  gauge  of  customer  interest  in  the  problem  or
need. The Net Promoter Score asks customers to answer a single question on
a  0-to-10  scale,  where  10  is  “extremely  likely”  and  0  is  “not  at  all  likely”:
“How  likely  is  it  that  you  would  recommend  our  company  to  a  friend  or
colleague?” Based on their responses, customers are categorized into one of
three  groups:  Promoters  (9-10  rating),  Passives  (7-8  rating),  and  Detractors
(0-6 rating). The percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of
promoters  to  obtain  a  Net  Promoter  Score.  An  NPS  of  +50  is  considered
excellent.

Analyze the results carefully. Dissect the numbers finely to determine if
some customer segments or media drove particularly enthusiastic customers
to engage with the MVP. For example, if 92 percent of teen girls forwarded
the information to all their friends while nobody else expressed any serious
interest, your business may still be quite viable.

Consider the Scalability: Not only is finding customers who care a daunting
challenge,  you  need  lots  of  them  to  be  successful.  What  if  your  startup
reaches break-even at 1 million activated users, for example (a modest goal
for  many  venture-backed  web  businesses)?  In  the  customer  creation  phase,
you  might  need  to  invite  500  million  people  to  visit—a  potentially
backbreaking expense if you hope to activate a million users.

Here’s the math:
Number of people exposed to the site or product   
2% of those exposed are actually acquired (1 in 50)   
10% of those acquired become activated customers (1 in
10)   

500,000,000
10,000,000
1,000,000
customers

Unless  customer  acquisition  is  almost  totally  viral  in  this  hypothetical
company, the costs of reaching 500 million people will result in running out
of money. To avoid it, be sure you’ve found an important, painful problem or
a serious customer need (then solve the problem or fill the need). The ability
to  attract  large  numbers  of  customers  will  make  or  break  the  business.  If
response  rates  don’t  at  least  approach  those  in  the  customer  relationships
hypothesis, it’s time to revisit the business model.

The “Just Do It” Scramble

Increasingly,  even  at  this  early  stage  of  customer  discovery,  some  investors
encourage startups to break all the rules and “just do it”—launch the product
even if it doesn’t exist. (Entrepreneurs are legendary rule-breakers anyway.)
That’s always an option, however your investors have a portfolio of 10, 20 or
more startups like you. Their bets are across the entire portfolio. You, on the
other hand, make a bet on a portfolio of one. There are times when tossing
this  book  out  and  “going  for  it”  makes  sense  (market  bubble,  incredible
customer reaction to the concept, etc.), but make sure you understand why.

Gain Customer Understanding

In addition to checking your assumptions about customer problems, you need
to  validate  your  hypotheses  about  how  customers  actually  spend  their  days,
spend  their  money  and  get  their  jobs  done.  Whether  the  product  is  for
corporate customers, a social network, or a new consumer electronic device,
you  want  to  understand  in  detail  how  their  lives  or  jobs  work,  how  their
work/design  flow  happens  and  how  they  currently  solve  the  problem  or  fill
the need.

If they’re in a business, are their jobs done in isolation? If not, how do
they interact with other departments? What other products do they use? Is the
problem they’ve identified limited to them, or do others in the company share
it? Is it possible to quantify the impact (dollars, time, costs, etc.) across the
entire organization? The same questions work for consumers. Will they use
the product themselves? Does it depend on others or their friends and family
using it?

You’ll  want  to  check  your  assumptions  about  whether  and  how  much
people  will  pay  for  your  solution.  What  would  make  customers  change  the
way they do things? Price? Features? A new standard? If the customer’s eyes
haven’t glazed over yet, dip your toe into the hypothetical product spec. “If
you  had  a  product  like  this  (describe  yours  in  conceptual  terms),  what
percentage  of  your  time  could  be  spent  using  the  product?  How  mission-
critical is it? Would it solve the pain mentioned earlier? What would be the
barriers to adopting a product like this?” (If you’re a founder who has been in
the industry you’re entering, you may already be a domain expert and already
bring deep customer understanding.)

Since  someday  soon  your  startup  will  have  to  create  demand  to  reach
these  customers,  use  this  opportunity  to  find  out  how  they  learn  about  new

products.  Who  are  the  visionaries  in  the  press/analyst/blogging  community
whom they read? Whom they respect?

Finally, never pass up an opportunity to spot talent. Can these customers
be helpful in the future? For the next round of conversations? For an advisory
board? As a paying customer? To refer you to other customers?

Your goal, after enough of these customer conversations, is to be able to
stand up in front of your company and say, “Here were our hypotheses about
our  customers,  their  problems,  and  how  they  worked.  Now  here’s  what
they’re saying their issues really are, and this is how they really spend their
day.”

Your  goal  is  to  understand  the  customer  in  depth.  What  does  in  depth
mean? It’s impossible to know their jobs as well as they do, but you should
be  so  thoroughly  conversant  with  what  truly  matters  to  customers  that  you
can discuss their issues convincingly.

In business-to-business companies, experience the customer at work, or
at  the  very  least  observe  it.  Spend  a  day  behind  a  cash  register,  at  a  trade
show, or at a conference the target customers are likely to attend. Buy lots of
coffees and have lots of casual conversations. Your goal should be to know
the  customer  you’re  pursuing,  and  every  aspect  of  his  or  her  business,  so
deeply and intimately that they start to think of you and talk to you as if you
were “one of them.”

Know the customer you’re pursuing so deeply they
think you’re “one of them.”

 Understanding customers for web/mobile applications starts with this

strategic view:

For  consumer  applications,  the  web  is  replacing  the  face-to-face  social
interactions  that  people  have  had  since  we  came  down  from  the  trees.
Friendships are taking on new meaning, having essentially moved online, to
social  networks.  Texting  has  replaced  conversations,  photo  sharing  has
eclipsed  the  sharing  of  snapshots,  and  online  games  have  replaced  board
games. “Traveling” salesmen spend more time on Skype and WebEx than on
the  road  and  network  through  LinkedIn,  Jigsaw  and  Facebook.  Even
grandparents often video-chat as much as they visit.

 
Business applications have gone the same way.
So as you gather customer data, ask yourself, “What are we replacing?

Why? How will it change what people now do physically?”

Understanding Customer Interactions (Figure 4.3)

Tactically,  it’s  equally  important  to  “become  a  customer”  of  existing
web/mobile  products  to  get  a  feel  for  how  customers  are  getting  their  jobs
done or needs fulfilled today. To do so, start to act like a customer:

Participate in their culture. Read their websites and publications, watch
their  favorite  videos,  movies  and  TV  shows,  and  share  as  many
customer experiences as possible

Get  to  know  real  live  customers,  not  just  in  focus  groups  but  in  the
places  where  they  really  spend  time.  Observe  when  they’re  online  and
when  they’re  off  and  what  they’re  doing  each  time  they  pick  up  their
handheld:  what  app  are  they  using,  who  are  they  texting  or  talking  to,
why did they choose this minute to play game A instead of game B, and
how did they learn about games A and B in the first place?

Play  the  games  they  play,  use  the  apps  they  use,  participate  in  their
social networks and regularly visit the sites they regularly visit. You can
internalize  the  customer’s  experience  by  observing  it  in  depth  and
understanding his behavior and motivation

Seek  to  understand,  quantitatively,  how  and  where  they  discover  new
ways to spend their time. From friends? From the “top seller” lists on an
app store? On the airplane or the school bus?

The goal is to “become the customer.”

Traffic/Competitive Analysis (Web/Mobile)

  The  tools  and  tactics  for  developing  market  knowledge  in  the  physical
channel work equally well in the web/mobile channels. Start by searching the
web and attending conferences, trade shows and other events to uncover great
market  insights.  In  addition,  meet-ups  of  local  groups  focused  on  certain
industries,  particularly  in  the  tech  world,  can  be  a  great  source  of  market
knowledge, as can webinars conducted by competitors.

Web-market knowledge should deliver a complete understanding of the
company’s  competitors  and  how  potential  customers  solve  the  problem  or
address the need.

Use free traffic-measurement tools to compare and
understand the traffic generated by each
competitive product...

Use free traffic-measurement tools like Alexa and Compete to compare
and understand the traffic generated by each competitive product or website,
along  with  the  traffic  sources,  growth  trends,  and  demographic  information
where available. Much of this information is available for free, including the
keywords driving traffic to the site, specific lists of sites linking to it and, in
some  cases,  demographic  and  income  data  on  site  visitors.  Compete.com
offers side-by-side comparison of multiple url’s, for example. Visit “answer”
sites like Quora.com and start asking questions. This will cause more market
information  to  surface  and  probably  lead  to  new  sources  of  expertise  on
product, category or market.

 
Mobile  startups  should  visit  every  app  store  for  each  appropriate
platform  to  identify  competitors  and  their  categories.  Where  do  the
competitors  rank  within  the  category,  and  is  that  rank  ascending  or
descending?  Try  to  determine  at  least  approximate  sales  volumes  wherever
possible.  And  read  the  product  reviews  both  at  the  stores  and  in  category-
specific review sites. There are particular challenges posed by the Apple app
store.  Their  review  process  and  lack  of  transparency  in  distribution  (how
many  people  see  your  app,  how  many  click  through,  how  many  download)
make accurate measures of acquisition/engagement difficult to come by.

Summarizing the results and reviewing them with the management team
is helpful, ensuring that everyone is well-versed in the competitive arena the
product is about to enter. Organize the competitive findings themselves into a
competitive  grid  and  a  market  map  to  help  position  and  market  the  new
product.

Note  to  reader:  These  following  guidelines,  geared  for  physical  channel
startups, are invaluable to web/mobile startups as well.

Capture Market Knowledge (Physical)

With a better customer understanding under your belt, it’s time to round out
your  understanding  of  the  overall  marketplace.  Meet  with  companies  in
adjacent  markets,  industry  analysts,  people  in  the  press,  and  other  key
influencers.  Go  to  industry  trade  shows  and  conferences  to  understand  the
shape and direction of the market you’re about to create.

When you start a company, you should have some vague notion of what
companies  are  in  adjacent  markets  or  are  part  of  the  infrastructure  or
ecosystem of your business. Through your own contacts, but usually through
introductions, take peers out to lunch. In exchange, gather information—not
competitive  information  but  answers  to  questions  such  as:  What  are  the
industry trends? What are key unresolved customer needs? Who are the key
players  in  this  market?  What  should  I  read?  Whom  should  I  know?  What
should I ask? What customers should I call on?

What  will  motivate  these  people  to  meet?  Most  won’t  do  it  out  of  the
goodness of their hearts; rather, they’ll meet to make a “trade.” They’ll learn
about a key problem and its solution in exchange for providing their industry
knowledge and insights.

Just  as  you  did  with  your  problem  presentation  to  potential  customers,
don’t  present  or  sell—just  listen  and  learn.  Spend  the  time  to  take  a  few  of
the  friendliest  customers  to  lunch  and  ask  them  who  they  see  as  potential
competitors,  both  internally  and  externally.  Who  do  they  think  has  similar
products? Who else is an innovator in this space? Has this solution been tried
elsewhere  in  their  company?  Is  anyone  else  inside  their  company  trying  to
build  this  product?  It’s  amazing  how  much  you  can  learn  from  the  people

who will eventually buy your product.

Ask the same questions of peers in adjacent markets, and after practicing
on  them,  try  to  make  contact  with  the  key  industry  influencers  and
recommenders listed in Phase 1 and ask them the same set of questions.

It’s a rare company that doesn’t have a website. These provide a treasure
trove of information, literally available at one’s fingertips, about competitors,
the  market,  and  the  industry  where  the  company  plans  to  compete.  Start  by
Googling the problem and reading perhaps the first few hundred links. Be as
specific  as  possible  in  selection  of  search  terms,  and  try  several  different
searches  for  maximum  information.  This  effort  leads  to  a  wealth  of  market
information,  including  news  about  the  category,  companies  providing
solutions,  key  blogs  and  websites  addressing  the  industry,  industry  experts,
and consultants.

Take competitors to lunch.

Then  dive  deeper  into  each  competitor  uncovered  in  the  initial  search.
Find  out  not  only  what  they  say  about  themselves  but  also  what  others  say
about them—positive and negative. Try to discern key product features and
selling  points,  which  help  differentiate  the  new  offering  from  competition.
Collect  industry  and  competitive  press  releases,  studies,  and  reports,  and
follow the thread to the consultants, researchers or pundits who wrote them to
see what else they’ve said.

Next,  start  gathering  quantitative  market  data.  More  than  likely,  Wall
Street analysts issue reports on the market or adjacent markets. Get copies of
all of these reports. More important, actually read them. Understand what the
analysts believe are the trends, the players, business models, and key metrics.
Finally,  industry  conferences  and  trade  shows  are  invaluable  and
essential.  Never  say,  “I’m  too  busy  to  attend.”  Attend  at  least  two  key
conferences or trade shows (the important ones picked in Phase 1). Not only
do they provide great trinkets, but conferences and trade shows are the prime
areas for both talent-and trend-spotting. Ask usual questions about trends and
players,  but  this  time  accomplish  a  few  things  that  can’t  happen  anywhere
else. Get demos of competitive and adjacent products. Get your hands on the
products themselves, get competitors’ literature, talk to their salespeople, and
generally immerse yourself in your new industry. Attend as many conference

 
sessions as possible, listening to others describe their products. What are their
visions  of  the  future,  and  how  do  they  compare  with  your  own  newly
developed value proposition?

After  testing  the  customer  problem  (or  need)  and  gaining  a  complete
understanding  of  the  customer,  it’s  time  to  expose  the  product  itself  to
potential  customers  for  the  first  time.  Not  to  sell  to  them  but  to  get  their
feedback.  Before  doing  so,  be  sure  to  update  the  hypotheses  and  business
model wherever changes are indicated.

CHAPTER 5

Customer Discovery, Phase Three: “Get
Out of the Building” and Test the Product
Solution

STEVE’S PHONE RANG AND THE VOICE ON THE end said, “You don’t know me
but I just read your book and think I need your help.” That was the day we
got  to  know  one  of  the  most  innovative  startups  within  a  “Fortune  500”
corporation (#6): General Electric’s Energy Storage division.

Prescott  Logan,  the  unit’s  brand-new  general  manager,  recognized  that
his  unit’s  new  sodium  industrial  battery  was  a  disruptive  innovation,  which
GE traditionally does well, but aimed at a market where the end users were
unknowns. Logan realized his division looked more like a multimillion-dollar
startup  with  all  the  usual  startup  uncertainty,  but  located  within  a  huge,
execution-oriented company. He needed a framework or architecture to help
his  team  deal  with  a  “white  space”  market  and  apply  startup  “search”  and
customer  discovery  principles  at  a  company  known  for  “six  sigma”
execution.

Energy  Storage  was  buying  capital  equipment,  breaking  ground  on  a
massive factory, and out making sales calls—in full “execute” mode, the way
most  big  companies  work—based  on  a  ton  of  diligence  and  an  external
consultant’s  30,000-foot  view  of  the  opportunity,  but  not  likely  having  had
enough face-to-face end user conversations.

Soon after the call, the customer-facing team came to the ranch to map a
customer  discovery  plan.  They  had  a  clear  fix  on  the  “customer  problem”
(life cycle, wider range of operating temperatures, etc.), and knew how they’d
take  the  well-vetted  innovation  from  the  lab  to  manufacturing,  but  one
question  remained.  Who  would  buy  it  in  volume,  and  why?  In  two  days  of
brainstorming, the Customer Development process offered GE the following
initial observations:

The  new  GE  battery  should  serve  dozens  of  market  segments,  not  just
the two they’d selected: backup systems for cell towers and data centers

They  needed  to  look  many  more  customers  in  the  eye  to  validate  the
market selection

Product  managers  were  spending  too  much  time  in  Schenectady,  N.Y.
there  were  no  customers  and  no  answers.
headquarters,  where 
Customers were outside the building

With  an  existing  global  customer  base,  GE  had  plenty  of  access  to
potential customers

They  needed  to  find  earlyvangelists,  essential  when  launching  new
technology like GE’s, and determine the earlyvangelists’ characteristics
as well as how to find them

They  needed  a  formal  process  to  review  what  discovery  data  they’d
gathered to date to understand how different the value proposition was
for each market segment—and where the opportunities might be greatest
for  a  high-performance,  more  expensive  alternative  to  lead-acid
industrial batteries (far bigger versions of the one in your car)

What  other  business  model  “boxes”  would  customers  like  them  to
change  in  order  to  sign  a  purchase  order?  The  GE  team  uncovered
several including changing the product features themselves, making the
leasing  and  other
product  somewhat  configurable,  and  offering 
alternative financing models

Prescott  grasped  Customer  Development  faster  and  better  than  anyone
we had ever seen. The Energy Storage division was a startup. All the rules for
managing  and  launching  product  line  extensions—business  plans  and
revenue  models—didn’t  work.  They  needed  instead  to  first  test  their  basic
hypotheses about their business model.

Leaving  the  ranch,  Prescott  and  team  joined  the  million-mile  club  as
they  flew  across  the  U.S.  and  to  Asia,  Africa  and  the  Middle  East,  meeting
face-to-face  with  dozens  of  prospects,  suspects,  and  influentials  to  explore
multiple potential new markets and applications. They did their best to leave
PowerPoint  decks  behind,  and  listen  to  customers’  problems,  needs,  and
frustrations  with  the  battery  status  quo.  Unscripted,  open-ended  discussions
with  a  wide  range  of  prospects  were  conducted  worldwide  to  listen  about

how  prospects  bought  their  batteries,  how  often  they  used  them,  and  the
operating  conditions.  In  one  target  market,  Prescott  actually  relocated  a  top
customer development team member and his family to India and said “don’t
come  home  til  you  get  a  purchase  order  signed,”  which  he  did,  learning
immensely about how his target segment customers might use the battery and
—more important—how they’d evaluate and buy.

Talking to a wide range of prospects, the team soon found more market
segments, and even though they aren’t huge businesses yet, they’re promising
because the product’s unique capabilities “unlock” far more value for users in
certain  segments.  For  example, 
footprint  and
environmental  friendliness  make  it  a  far  better  choice  as  a  backup  to
computer systems in high-rise office buildings, where real estate is expensive
and the floors often can’t hold the weight of massive lead-acid battery arrays.
In  one  case,  they  found  an  architect  who  said  “I  don’t  really  care  what  it
costs, I want it.”– the precise definition of an earlyvangelist!

the  battery’s  small 

It was customer discovery and early validation on steroids, driven by a
passionate entrepreneurial CEO (though Jeff Immelt has that particular title)
who’d  stand  up  against  any  valley  startup  leader.  Prescott’s  boss,  GE  VP
Tina  Donikowski,  provided  cover  while  the  team  executed  the  thorough,
honest  search  process  any  startup  must  have,  rather  than  the  six  sigma
execution  drills  that  made  GE  so  famous.  And  Prescott  chose  people  who
didn’t fit the typical big company mold: “white space” thinkers who lived for
the search and embrace the unknown.

While the jury is still out, and the business is a long way from its huge
revenue goals, this team of passionate entrepreneurs hiding in a “Fortune 6”
company have just about posted a “sold out” sign on the factory for its first
six months of operation. We think that sign has a good chance of being up for
a while.

“Test the Solution:” an Overview

The  previous  phase  tested  the  customer  problem  or  need  and  explored
customers’  passion  for  it,  This  phase  tests  whether  the  solution  to  that
problem—the  value  proposition—gets  customers’  enthusiastic  enough  to
buy/use the product. This phase has five steps:

Update the business model and team—a Pivot or proceed point

Create  the  product  solution  presentation  (physical  channel)  or  the  high
fidelity MVP test (web/mobile)

Test  the  “product  solution”  (physical  channel)  or  begin  to  measure
customer behavior (web/mobile channel)

Yet again, update the business model and team

Identify the first advisory board members

  Web/mobile  startups  find  it  hard  for  customers  to  visualize  the
proposed solution without a minimum viable product. (Most startups should
have  at  least  their  low  fidelity  MVP  up  by  now.)  The  MVP  illustrates  the
product for customers so they can see whether the minimally featured product
solves  the  problem.  Feedback  takes  the  form  of  online  and  in-person
discussions. (Screen shots and mock-ups are no longer viable stand-ins.)

Update the Business Model and Team (a Pivot-or-
Proceed Point)

With  a  far  deeper  understanding  of  customers  and  their  problems,  it’s  time
for  an  important  pivot-or-proceed  pause  in  the  Customer  Development
process. While some startups have already pivoted, every entrepreneur should
use this step to take a pause and review the collection of customer feedback
about the problem and its importance. Those findings, coupled with extensive
customer,  industry,  and  competitive  research,  have  taught  the  company  a
great  deal  about  its  customers,  how  they  work  or  play,  the  market,  and  the
problem  the  company  has  been  founded  to  solve.  This  learning  makes  it  a
near-certainty that at least some business model hypotheses need to change.
(When  a  substantial  change  is  made  to  one  or  more  business  model

hypotheses, it’s a pivot.)

Start  this  phase  by  gathering  as  much  of  the  company  management  as
possible (not just the founders and VPs but directors and managers as well),
along  with  key  investors,  for  the  pivot-or-proceed  review.  Share  everything
that’s  been  learned,  with  a  focus  on  customer  feedback  regarding  the
importance or severity of the problem or need—the potential product/market
fit.  The  group  also  reviews  new  findings  that  may  affect  hypotheses  or
assumptions  made  in  Phase  1,  adjusting  them  where  appropriate.  These  can
often  include  the  value  proposition  or  product  specs,  customer  segments,
pricing, and revenue model assumptions.

Start by Assembling the Data

Before the meeting, the Customer Development team gathers all the customer
data and builds a work-flow map of the prototypical customer. At the meeting
itself, the spokesperson for the team diagrams and describes how customers
actually  do  their  job  and  whom  they  interact  with.  This  provides  a  reality
check of the customer hypotheses. Keep diagramming and drawing until it’s
easy  to  explain  how  customers’  businesses  and  lives  work  today,  including
how  they  spend  their  time  and  money.  Compare  this  description  with  the
initial  hypotheses.  (While  corporate  customers  may  have  more  formal
organization  to  diagram,  a  consumer  will  have  more  external  influencers  to
track.)

With the customer work flow and interactions fully described, dive into
the real news. What problems did customers say they have? How painful are
these  problems?  Where  on  the  “problem  scale”  are  the  customers  you
interviewed? How are they solving these problems today? Draw the customer
workflow  with  and  without  your  product.  Is  the  difference  dramatic?  Did
customers say they would pay for that difference? In general, what did you
learn  about  customers’  problems?  What  were  the  biggest  surprises?  What
were the biggest disappointments?

Question Everything

Once  the  Customer  Development  team  has  presented  its  findings,  the  fun
begins.  You  can  now  ask  the  most  difficult  question.  Given  all  that’s  been

learned from talking to customers, how well do the preliminary product specs
solve  their  problems?  Dead  on?  Somewhat?  Not  exactly?  If  the  answer  is
“somewhat”  or  “not  exactly,”  this  meeting  becomes  a  soul-searching,
the  right  people  weren’t
company-building  exercise.  Is 
interviewed?  Failed  to  talk  to  enough  people?  Because  nobody  asked  the
right  questions?  This  assessment  is  critical  because  of  a  fundamental
assumption  of  the  Customer  Development  model:  before  changing  the
product, keep looking for customer enthusiasm. If and only if no customers
can be found for the product, discuss changing the feature list.

it  because 

People  who  talk  to  customers  tend  to  collect  a  list  of  features  that,  if
added,  will  get  one  additional  customer  to  buy.  Soon  there’s  a  10-page
feature  list  just  for  selling  10  customers.  In  contrast,  in  Customer
Development  the  goal  is  to  have  a  single-paragraph  feature  list  that  can  be
sold to thousands of customers.

What if everyone believes you’re talking to the right customers but the
feedback says you’re building the wrong product? Something has to change.
Don’t  continue  building  the  product  and  think  miracles  will  happen.  Either
get back outside the building and find a different set of customers who will
buy the product or consider changing the features.

Assuming  the  product  is  at  least  a  partial  fit  for  customers’  problems,
continue  examining  the  product  assumptions  and  specs.  Based  on  customer
feedback,  review  the  Phase  1  feature  list.  Prioritize  the  features  in  terms  of
their  importance  to  the  customer.  Can  the  Customer  Development  team
match each feature to a customer problem? If not, why not? While figuring
out what features to ship is important, knowing which features don’t matter is
equally  important.  Which  features  did  customers  not  care  about?  Can  any
features on the product spec be deleted or deferred? Remember, in a startup
the  Customer  Development  team  isn’t  supposed  to  be  adding  features;  it’s
supposed  to  be  finding  out  the  minimum  feature  set,  based  on  input  from
visionary customers.

Next, review and get agreement on the delivery schedule, again revising
Phase  1  assumptions  as  necessary.  As  noted  earlier,  visionary  customers,
particularly in corporations, will be buying into the entire vision, not just the
MVP. They will need to hear what the company plans to deliver over the next
18 months.

Earlyvangelists need to hear about the 18-month

product roadmap.

Finally, as a group, review the other Phase 1 hypotheses. (Now it’s clear
why  writing  them  all  down  was  important.)  Given  all  the  feedback  from
customers,  which  of  the  four  market  types  is  the  company  in?  Why  is  it
different?  What  are  its  competitive  advantages?  Do  the  initial  pricing  and
delivery channel assumptions hold up? What was learned about influencers?

  While  this  step  is  largely  the  same  for  web/mobile  startups,  they
have  the  advantage  of  more  behavioral  data  to  assess.  Web/mobile  startups
can quantify customer interest in and enthusiasm for solving the problem or
filling  the  need.  The  analysis  shouldn’t  care  whether  2.5  percent  or  3.2
percent  of  the  customers  were  interested  but  should  instead  assess  whether
this is a big, serious “hair-on-fire” problem that many customers are eager to
solve. Customer discovery data is limited because online problem discovery
is conducted on a small scale, so right now your analysis is simply directional
in nature. Some signs that the problem or need is sizable or serious:

At least 10 percent (25 percent or 50 percent is even better) of customers
exposed to the problem somehow indicate their interest in solving it

Many of those exposed to the problem pass information along to friends
or coworkers

A Net Promoter Score of at least +50 or, ideally, far higher

Some clear segment of the total market is particularly passionate about
the problem or need

Pivot or Proceed

Regardless  of  channel,  this  step  concludes  with  the  first  of  many  pivot-or-
proceed  discussions.  Management  and  investors  affirm  they’re  confident
they’re  the  company  has  uncovered  a  problem  in  which  a  sizable  enough
universe of customers is clearly eager to solve. If not, it’s time to rethink the
value  proposition  and  attack  a  more  severe  problem  or  a  need  of  greater
interest or urgency to a larger customer universe. If the universe is eager to

 
solve  the  problem,  the  group  moves  on  to  present  its  potential  product
solution to customers.

...summarizing customer findings is not an
accounting problem.

One last thought: Collecting and summarizing customer findings is not
an  accounting  problem.  You  aren’t  simply  adding  up  the  number  of
responses. You’re looking for learning, meaning and insight in the data. And
more than anything, you’re looking for hordes of customers who will try to
rip the product right out of your hands so they can have it before their friends
or competitors.

High Fidelity MVP Test

 The “Low Fidelity MVP Test” probed the intensity of customer interest in
the  problem  or  need.  Now  it’s  time  to  determine  whether  customers  will
engage with or buy the product or use the site or app.

This “solution test” is not a live launch or even a “soft” launch; rather, it
simply invites a limited number of customers to experience the MVP (which
is a continuously improving work in progress). That “limited number” can be
measured  in  thousands,  and  if  even  more  show  up  that’s  a  very  good  sign,
since they’ve probably been sent by friends who think highly of the solution.

This “solution test” is not a live launch or even a
“soft” launch.

Large-scale testing isn’t the goal here. At this point, you’re opening the
“front door” and inviting a modest number of customers in. It’s discovering
enough  passionate,  enthusiastic  earlyvangelists  who  clearly  believe  the
product  solves  their  problem.  (Here  is  guidance  on  home  and  landing  page
MVP development.)

More  than  anything  else,  watch  for  the  “velocity”  of  customer
activation.  What’s  velocity?  In  a  car,  it’s  how  fast  it’s  moving.  In  a
web/mobile business, velocity means several things, often at once:

how many visits before someone activates

how many tell their friends

 
how fast those friends activate, and

how quickly—and how often—visitors return

Two rare exceptions to this quest for velocity may be niche vertical sites
like  “lefthandedprobowlers.com”  and  high-value  products  like  enterprise
software  or  extravagant  jewelry,  where  fewer  high-value  customers  may  be
just fine.

Stealth or No?

It’s impossible to launch a hi-fidelity MVP test in “stealth” mode, since the
product and its website are being exposed to customers and prospects to test
their reactions. Customer Development and stealth are mutually exclusive. If
you believe your idea is so fragile that it cannot be exposed to non-employees
without  a  signed  non-disclosure  agreement,  you  shouldn’t  be  reading  this
book.

A  completely  open,  public  site  or  app  invites  competitors,  so  you  may
want  to  consider  an  “invite-only”  site  to  control  access  as  you  test  your
solution.

In  most  markets  and  industries  the  trade  press  is  not  investigative
journalism  (you  have  to  set  yourself  on  fire  to  get  noticed).  As  a  reminder,
now  is  not  the  time  for  press  releases,  interviews,  blogs  or  public  demos
(other than to potential investors). You simply do not know enough yet to say
what  business  you  are  in.  If  you  do  get  noticed  by  the  press,  simply  don’t
return their e-mails or calls.

Measure Customer Behavior

 The high-fidelity MVP test launched in the previous step began inviting
customers  to  engage  with  your  product,  site  or  app.  The  goal  is  not  to  sell
them anything (even though that may happen more than once) but instead to
gauge  the  extent  of  their  enthusiasm  for  the  product.  As  customers  arrive,
each one of their actions should be measured: where they come from, what
they click on, what they do and how long they stay, to name a few. It’s not a
statistical  exercise  at  all,  but  a  process  that  begins  by  knowing  the  right
metrics to measure.

PROCEED  WITH  CAUTION:  Remember, 
an
overview/tutorial.  There’s  no  way  you  can  implement  all  this  or  even
process this in one sitting.

this 

is 

Measure Enthusiasm Most of All

These metrics are key “enthusiasm indicators” for almost any product, app, or
site:
Purchase:  Obviously  a  favorite  among  e-commerce  and  subscription  sites,
this action is the easiest to measure if the product or service is available for
sale, even as an MVP, at this very early stage. If not, an acceptable substitute
is customers’ willingness to register so they can be notified when the product

 
 
is available or simply to learn more about it.

Engagement:  Once  a  user  visits  for  the  first  time,  how  often  does  he  come
back?  Multi-sided  market  and  other  ad-supported  sites  need  to  know  users
will  come  back  often,  generating  page  views  that  lead  to  revenue.  If  a  user
comes back five times a day or a week, that’s promising. Five times a month
probably  won’t  deliver  a  scalable  business.  If  1,000  customers  come  once,
how  many  of  them  return  often,  as  opposed  to  those  who  seldom  or  never
return? Dig deep to determine the level of user engagement:

how often do users visit?

how long do they stay?

how active are they when using the site or app?

What are the characteristics of frequent returnees (are they gear heads,
teens, retirees or housewives)?

Can more of them be found cost-effectively?

At low-engagement sites like Weather.com and bing.com, and apps like
tip  calculators  or  Foursquare,  customers  hit  the  app  or  site,  find  what  they
want,  and  depart  in  a  matter  of  moments.  These  sites  and  apps  need  to
measure  frequency  of  use  to  determine  enthusiasm.  If  users  visit  once  a
month, they’re of little value; if they use an app dozens of times a day, it’s
probably a strong multi-sided market product. Low-engagement sites should
measure frequency of use first.

Look for significant visit frequency or time spent on
the site...

High-engagement sites like multiplayer games, social networks, and rich
niche-content sites need to look for significant time spent on the site: a solid
percentage of visitors:

registering

filling out profiles, posting

 
comments

uploading photos

inviting friends to engage

Retention:  for  almost  any  app  or  site,  retention  is  a  critical  measure  of
customer  enthusiasm.  It’s  tricky  to  measure  retention  during  the  customer
discovery phase, when time spans are relatively short. After all, if discovery
is  under  way  for  two  months,  retention  can  be  measured  for  only  that  brief
period. Look for behavior patterns. Measure both of the most obvious form of
attrition (the opposite or enemy of retention): unsubscribes and terminations.
Inactivity is the most insidious form of attrition, particularly in mobile apps.
People don’t delete the app, but they also never use it.

Referral: Do site visitors or MVP users refer their friends?

what percentage refer others?

do they refer one or two or six or 10?

whose referrals engage better than others?

which referrals become heavy users or referrers?

The  operators  of  freecash.com  would  no  doubt  get  a  near-infinite
number  of  referrals  if  the  site  lived  up  to  its  name.  Greater  referral  volume
indicates  enthusiasm  for  the  product  and  also  should  point  toward  a  lower
customer acquisition cost, since many customers may come via referrals from
other customers. Both are good indicators of success potential.

Conduct Pass/Fail Tests

For each test, you should have a pass/fail metric developed earlier. But look
for great or massive response and activity, not just a passing grade.

The answer to pass/fail tests is binary, by definition: Do (more than 50%
of) customers love it? Is the product exciting to “enough” customers (insert
your number here) for the startup to move forward to the customer validation
step?

How  many  customers  are  “enough”  is  a  multipart  question  for

entrepreneurs, not accountants.

Detailed  spreadsheets  and  analyses  will  help 

immensely  during
customer validation, when the behavior of tens of thousands of visitors will
be measured in painstaking detail. For now, job No. 1 is to be sure the test is
valid,  with  the  success  criteria  established  upfront  and  factored  into  the
business model. For example, if you need to spend $50 on Facebook ads to
get an order, that’s great if the product costs $200, but not so good if it sells
for  $49.95.  So  when  you  “pass”  a  test,  you’re  moving  closer  with  each
passing grade to a successful business model.

How many customers are “enough” is a multipart
question for entrepreneurs, not accountants.

The question of Earlyvangelist volume needs a convincing answer: yes,
enough  interested,  passionate  earlyvangelists  can  be  found  to  buy  the
product.  (They  will  guide  product  development  and  marketing  through  the
next stages of Customer Development.)

Don’t stop driving people toward the product until you’re certain of:

How many people who expressed serious interest in the need or problem
actually  accept  an  invitation  to  explore  the  product,  and  how  many
engage or accept the call to action?

How many less interested or uninterested people are willing to explore
and engage?

For each of those groups, how many will tell others, and how many will
they tell?

Answer each question on both an absolute and a percentage basis. If, for
example,  1,000  people  show  up,  were  invitations  sent  to  2,000  or
200,000? The implications are obvious

Whether  via  e-mail,  AdWords,  Twitter  or  carrier  pigeon,  each  set  of
invitations  should  be  sent  multiple  times  (read  about  e-mail  cascades)  for
maximum impact. Consider changing the messaging if traffic or engagement
are inadequate. Otherwise, nobody will ever know if the messaging was bad

 
or the product was uninteresting.

Measure Test Results Carefully

It’s  crucial  to  measure  customer  behavior  with  the  MVP  itself.  While  user
volume will probably be small, measure not only the traffic and user activity
but  also  the  traffic  sources  and  acquisition  and  activation  rates.  How  much
time did users spend with the product or on the site? Did visitors register on
the  first,  second,  or  third  visits?  Referral  rates,  perhaps  the  most  critical
measure of enthusiasm, should be closely measured as well. (Guidelines are
found in Chapter 3.)

But look for great responses and activity, not just a
passing grade.

Assemble the data and mine it deeply, looking for insights into sources
of traffic, most or least engaged customer types, those who referred the most
customers,  and  other  clues.  The  data  will  be  reviewed  in  depth  in  the  next
phase,  but  focus  on  one  simple  thing:  have  we  found  enough  people
interested in the product to move forward to customer validation?

Study channel data: In the web/mobile product arena, channels may be
resellers  like  amazon.com,  an  app  store  or  iTunes  or  aggregator  reseller
websites  like  GameStop,  CDW  or  yugster.  Interact  with  these  channels  to
understand their regulations governing new products, how long it takes from
initial contact until actual live sales begin on their sites, payment terms and
more.  Since  they  deal  with  massive  volumes  of  app  and  software  sales,  the
execs at these resellers can be extremely helpful on such key issues as pricing
and positioning.

In the customer discovery phase, numbers themselves often aren’t strong
or exciting. Before abandoning ship, dig deeper to determine whether the app
or  site  has  hit  a  nerve  among  a  customer  cohort  or  segment  (teenage  girls,
first-time  site  visitors,  old  golfers).  Mine  the  data  from  the  most  frequent
users (easy if there aren’t too many of them) to see if they share any common
traits.  Might  they  all  be  Democrats  or  gourmet  cooks  or  young  urban
professionals?  If  so,  consider  iterating  the  marketing  messages  and  the

 
audience  targeting  in  hopes  of  getting  far  more  excitement  and  engagement
from a smaller subset of the total population.

Multi-sided  markets  should  also  conduct  initial  conversations  with  the
other  “side”  of  their  market:  the  people  who  will  pay  to  reach  the  audience
aggregated by the site or application. How do the “payers” buy advertising?
What are they willing to pay? How long does the process take, and at what
point should conversations begin? (Here is a more detailed discussion of the
“other side” of multi-sided markets.)

Update the Business Model Again
(Another Pivot-or-Proceed Point)

Here you’ll update the business model to reflect the latest round of customer
discovery “solution” findings and how they do or don’t affect the elements of
your  business  model.  Think  of  it  as  a  “tune  up,”  since  you’ll  conduct  a
thorough business model review in the next phase.

Your focus here is totally about customers’ enthusiasm for the product,

and the conversation should be about pass/fail test results, not opinions.

  For  web/mobile  startups,  data  plays  an  even  greater  role  in  this

conversation, as discussed below.

Your business model should undergo regular
updates.

Look for Massive Customer Enthusiasm

This is the time to remember that lukewarm response to any product or the
problem  it  solves  is  a  serious,  red-alert  danger  signal  that  calls  for  an
iteration  or  a  pivot  rather  than  an  automatic  step  forward  into  customer
validation.  Discuss  the  percentages  as  well  as  the  number  of  customers
visited who express rabid or significant enthusiasm for the product and high
confidence that it solves an important business problem or fills a high-priority
consumer need. What’s the team’s honest appraisal of how many customers
would run out and buy it immediately? How many would tell all their friends

 
or  associates?  Did  any  or,  better,  many  declare  the  best  possible  vote  of
confidence, “I don’t care if it’s not complete or perfect—I want it now”? Start
the  conversation  by  sorting  customer  reactions  into  the  following  main
categories:

     Category 1: Customers unequivocally love the product, and no changes

are needed.

     Category 2: Customers like the product, but we’ve heard consistently that

they want this or that additional feature at launch.

     Category 3: Customers can understand the product after a long

explanation, but no one was jumping over the table to buy it.

     Category 4: Customers don’t see much of a need for the product.

If  most  of  the  customers  fall  into  Category  1,  congratulations!  If  the
business  model  components  “add  up,”  as  reviewed  in  the  next  step,  it  may
well be time move on to customer validation.

Regardless  of  channel,  customer  discovery  sought  a  market  for  the
product as originally spec’ed. The most dangerous customer responses lie in
Category 2: “We need more features.” As emphasized earlier, knowing which
features don’t matter is as important as knowing which features to ship first.
Balance customer reactions with development time, since it may take much
more  product  development  effort  to  earn  a  convincing  Category  1  answer.
Why?  Because  the  joke  is  true:  “Normal  people  believe  if  it  isn’t  broke,  it
doesn’t  need  to  be  fixed.  Engineers  believe  if  it  isn’t  broke,  it  doesn’t  have
enough features yet.”

The  natural  instinct  of  Engineering  is  to  keep  adding  features.  But
customer discovery is a race to get the MVP into paying customers’ hands as
quickly as possible, so fewer features or an MVP that’s just “good enough”
are  far  better  than  losing  a  month  or  even  a  week’s  worth  of  customer
feedback. Ask whether any features can be deferred. Let early customers help
determine  which  features  and  functionality  to  add  and  in  what  sequence.
Listening carefully to the right customers delivers a product strategy with a
high likelihood of success in any channel.

 In the web/mobile channels, the team is reviewing granular behavior
data from a larger universe of early customers. Qualitative discussions about
features should happen, but almost every discussion is augmented with hard,

cold  facts  about  customer  behavior,  and  data  is  central  to  almost  every
discussion point. Some of the facts to discuss, always in absolute numbers as
well as percentages:

Page  views  per  day  or  week  and  the  growth  rate  of  those  page  views
over time

Average time spent or page views with the site or product

“Rate of gain,” or the time it takes people to increase time/page views on
subsequent visits

Number  of  repeat  visits  for  avid  and  average  users;  time  lag  between
repeat  visits  and  “rate  of  gain,”  or  the  measurable  decrease  in  time
between visits

Number  and  percentage  of  invited  or  aware  customers  who  were
acquired

Conversion  rates  of  visitors-to-acquired,  acquired-to-activated,  and
activated-to-active-users

Referral  rates  and  virality:  number  and  percentage  of  early  users  who
refer  their  friends,  how  many  they  refer,  and  how  many  friends  are
acquired/activated/actively engaged

Lukewarm customer response can indicate a
profound problem.

While the numbers are probably small in many of the categories above,
the  discovery  process  is  more  directional  than  finite.  To  be  honest,  it’s  a
search for rampant customer enthusiasm—the kind that delivers blockbuster
business  success.  Determine  whether  there’s  enough  customer  enthusiasm
and positive feedback to warrant a move forward to more rigorous testing in
customer validation.

This  is  where  entrepreneurial  experience  and  “gut”  guide  the  go/no-go
decision. And the most convincing arguments for “go” involve statistics that
show  lots  of  activation,  many  people  visiting  and  coming  back  again  and
again, and many more telling more and more of their friends or colleagues.

 
So while the statistics drive the conversation, the leaders’ instincts make the
decision. This is where seasoned entrepreneurs, advisers, and investors have
the potential to make important contributions.

Answers in Categories 3 and 4—customers aren’t jumping over the table
or don’t see a need—are typical during a first round of customer discovery.
At  a  minimum,  they  require  serious  thought  and  probably  a  pivot  that
involves restarting Phase 1 from the beginning rather than continuing forward
on a death march to failure. This makes for a challenging board meeting but
is  often  a  critical  turning  point  for  investors  and  company  alike.  For
technology  products,  lukewarm  customer  response  can  indicate  a  profound
problem, usually characterized as the lack of product/market fit: not enough
of a market for the product or a lack of robust demand for a product in a vast
market.

Repackaging the Product—A Pivot Strategy

Other  issues  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  positioning  but  more  accurately
described as “product repackaging.” Product repackaging is a problem most
technology  startups  have  to  deal  with  at  some  point.  A  technology-driven
startup’s  first  product  is  usually  determined  by  the  founding  product
development team. Often the product development team has a perfect feel for
what  the  customers’  needs  are  and  how  the  customers  want  to  buy  the
product.  But  most  of  the  time  they  don’t.  If  they  haven’t  been  intimately
connected  to  the  customer,  the  initial  product  configuration  needs  further
refinement  by  the  Customer  Development  team.  While  the  core  technology
might be spot-on, its match for customer needs or purchase preferences can
be off. A single monolithic software package might be too expensive or too
complex to sell that way. Technology repackaging might solve the problem
by reconfiguring the product features. Perhaps it can be sold as modules, or
as  a  subscription  service,  or  with  increasingly  featured  versions,  without
requiring  Product  Development  to  completely  reengineer  the  product.  This
problem must be caught and dealt with in customer discovery or it may affect
the company’s ability to survive.

Update the Business Model Canvas Again

Regardless  of  channel,  this  series  of  analyses  and  discussions  will  almost
certainly  affect  some  of  the  business  model  hypotheses.  Most  likely  to  be
affected  is  the  value  proposition,  since  this  first  “solution  discovery”  effort
helps shed light on whether people think the product solves the problem in a
way that compels them to buy. When it doesn’t, the value proposition is the
most likely suspect for adjustment, whether features are added or subtracted
as a result.

Customer  segments  should  be  reviewed,  since  the  product  may  have
resonated  well  with  some  segments  and  not  others.  If,  for  example,  the
product  generates  excitement  only  among  a  subset  of  the  intended  market
(men, not women; managers, not staff people), that discovery will affect the
revenue stream hypothesis as well. The team will conduct a thorough review
of the business model in the next phase, so this is best thought of as a tune-up
that  updates  the  model  to  reflect  the  latest  round  of  customer  discovery
“solution” findings.

As  good  as  any  founding  team  may  be,  invaluable  people  outside  the
company  who  can’t  be  hired  full  time  will  often  be  willing  to  help  in  an
advisory  capacity.  These  advisers  can  help  solve  technical  problems,
introduce  key  customers,  provide  domain-specific  knowledge,  and  share
business  expertise  and  wisdom.  Throughout  customer  discovery,  when
meeting  customers  and  analysts,  prospecting  for  advisory  board  members
should always be in the back of everyone’s minds.

Product Development should engage some advisers for specific help in
designing  and  building  the  product,  and  a  business  mentor,  someone  who’s
been  through  the  startup  grind  before,  may  also  be  helpful.  One  or  two
customer voices typically stand out from the crowd. Engage these people by
asking them for advice, taking them to lunch or dinner, and seeing if they’re
interested  in  helping.  Formalize  the  advisory  board  process  later,  during
customer validation.

Customer Discovery, Phase Four: Verify
the Business Model and Pivot or Proceed

HAS YOUR CUSTOMER DISCOVERY EFFORT turned your hypotheses (or guesses)
into hard facts? Do you believe it’s time to proceed to customer validation,
when you test whether your business model can scale?

There are three critical questions to answer:

1.  Have we found a product/market fit? Is there sizable demand for solving
the  problem,  and  does  the  product  fill  that  demand  well  in  the
customers’ eyes?

2.  Who are our customers and how do we reach them? Do we understand
the demography and archetypes of our key target customers and enough
about their behavior to know how to find them cost-effectively?

3.  Can we make money and grow the company? Can we grow predictably

and large enough to make a great company?

If your answer to this analysis is “proceed,” remember that it’s still not
time  to  launch.  This  go/no-go  decision  answers  only  one  question:  do  we
have enough confidence in customers’ enthusiasm and the product/market fit
to proceed to customer validation and see if our business model scales by five
times, 10 times or more? It’s often frustrating to entrepreneurs who make the
“go” decision, since they’re rarin’ to get out and start doing and selling. After
all,  that’s  what  entrepreneurs  do.  It’s  also  a  dangerous  trap:  customer
validation accelerates spending, which—if unsuccessful—can cost you your
job, your equity, or both. (As we’ve said, this process isn’t easy.)

Is This Business Worth Doing? (Figure 6.1)

Bring  your  team  and  investors  to  a  “full  stop”  to  answer  the  questions
above. At a bare minimum, whether you Pivot or Proceed is the subject of an
entire board meeting. Generally this assessment forces at least one return trip
back to the start of the discovery process. This is the norm! (It’s far better to
find out now, before more years of 100-hour workweeks are invested.)

  The  three  questions  you’re  answering  are  virtually  identical,
regardless  of  whether  the  product  and  channel  are  physical  or  web/mobile.
But  web/mobile  startups  should  have  far  more  customer  feedback  and  have
implemented  more  product  iterations  than  their  counterparts  in  the  physical
world.  Web/mobile  startups  should  already  see  some  measurable  “velocity”
in  their  rates  of  customer  activation  (which  may  not  be  as  clear-cut  in
physical  channel  startups).  If  your  web/mobile  startup  isn’t  seeing  strong
early signs of customer activation (sign-ups, referrals, return visits, upsells),
it’s almost certainly time to stop right here and start exploring changes to the
business model.

Have We Found a Product/Market Fit?

Product/market fit has three components:

Is  the  problem  or  need  that’s  addressed  urgent  or  vital  to  lots  of
customers—i.e., is there a market? (Replace “lots” with a real “pass/fail”
number.)

Does your product solve the problem or fill the need at a price customers
will gladly pay? (Insert real number from business model, of course.)

Are  there  enough  customers  (insert  number)  “out  there”  to  deliver  a
sizable (insert number) business opportunity?

This  checkpoint  is  important  enough  to  take  these  questions  one  at  a
time. (If you’re uncertain or want more data, there’s a deeper exploration of
this set of questions at the end of Chapter 11.)

Are you attacking a serious problem or filling a
compelling need?

This  question  should  have  been  thoroughly  probed  directly  with  customers
both  online  and,  more  important,  face-to-face.  Have  you  consistently  heard
enthusiastic responses like “This is a high-priority problem (or need) near the
top  of  my  list?”  If  they  add  comments  like  “I’d  pay  anything  to  solve  this
problem” or “My patchwork solution isn’t good enough,” even better. Probe
only  for  a  high  level  of  consistent  enthusiasm.  That  defines  a  market
opportunity.

Key questions to review and discuss:

Did your customers have friends or colleagues with similar problems or
needs, and did they think the problem was important enough to discuss it

with, or refer it to, their friends or coworkers?

Were  many  of  the  customers  you  met  attempting  home-grown  or
workaround solutions to the problem your product will solve?

Did most customers rate the problem or need’s severity at 8, 9, or 10 on
a scale of 10?

Did most customers rate the pain caused by the problem at or near 5 on a
scale of 5?

Review the before-and-after customer work-flow diagram.

Was the difference dramatic after buying the product?

Were customers palpably excited?

Did customers say they would pay for that difference?

  Web/mobile  startups  should  look  closely  at  customer  or  user
referrals  to  gauge  the  problem’s  magnitude  and  importance.  If  only  tens  or
hundreds of users have the problem or need or nobody thinks it’s of interest
to  their  friends  or  associates,  this  is  an  “acid  test”  of  the  problem’s
seriousness.  If  inquiries  from  referred  potential  users  yield  few  or  no
activations, it’s equally serious. Stop and get on the phone with as many of
those users (nonusers, really) as possible to understand their lack of interest.
Perhaps it’s the messaging, an easy fix. Don’t “sell” them in the call—probe
for their genuine interest and listen for opportunities to change the message,
the product, or the activation incentives.

Does your product solve the problem or fill the need
for your customers?

Review  all  the  customer  feedback  report  cards,  summaries,  and  analysis—
there should be quite a pile of it. Here again, as with validating the problem
question, be sure there’s robust enthusiasm for the product, even in its MVP
form. Look for comments like “I have to have this now” or “Everyone I know
will  want  one”  or  “When  can  I  get  it?”  Lukewarm  or  average  enthusiasm
seldom  delivers  scalable  startups.  Be  objective  and  park  entrepreneurial
enthusiasm at the door.

Key questions to review and discuss:

Did the minimum viable product generate significant “buy” or “engage”
enthusiasm?

Was  the  product  exciting  enough  to  stimulate  significant  customer
referrals? Did those referred customers buy or engage at an encouraging
rate?

Did  the  long-term  product  vision  generate  highly  positive  customer
feedback?

Is  the  latest  product-features-and-benefits  hypothesis  still  appropriate
and profitable?

the 

Did 
enthusiasm?

long-term  product-delivery  schedule  generate  purchase

Also  review  the  delivery  schedule,  revising  assumptions  as  necessary.
Customers  are  buying  into  the  entire  vision,  not  just  the  MVP,  and  need  to
hear how and when the product will evolve.

 One of the telltale symptoms of a bad “solution” fit for web/mobile
startups  is  easy  to  spot:  tons  of  acquisition  but  very  little  activation.  Your
potential  customers  agree  that  you’ve  hit  on  a  problem  or  a  need  they  care
about,  so  they  came  to  learn  more,  but  when  they  arrived,  they  didn’t  like
your proposed solution.

Customer  feedback  is  vital  here.  First  probe  customers’  feelings  about
the  product,  site,  or  app  and  what  they  liked  or  didn’t  like  about  it.  Then
probe the messaging. Did the product not deliver on the message (as in “Lose
20 pounds tomorrow”) that got them to the site in the first place? Was it their
lack  of  confidence  in  the  product,  a  lack  of  evidence  (claims,  testimonials,
diagrams or demos), or poor messaging? Get to the bottom of these questions
before  proceeding,  gathering  as  much  one-on-one  feedback  from  both
activators and non-activators. What led the activators to sign up? What was
missing  in  the  pitch—the  product,  the  “sales  pitch”  or  the  company  that
might have changed the minds of non-activators?

Are there Enough Customers to Deliver a Sizable
Business Opportunity?

Did  customers  verify  that  they’d  buy  at  the  level  you  expected?  Did  any
competitive or other data emerge pointing to larger or smaller market share?
Review  your  initial  TAM  (total  addressable  market)  and  SAM  (serviceable
market)  hypotheses  and  compare  those  estimates  with  what  customers
actually  said.  How  much  do  they  buy,  how  often,  and  are  their  friends  or
colleagues similarly inclined? Check findings against market knowledge and
competitive analysis data gathered in Phase 2.

Key questions to review and discuss:

Have you validated the TAM and SAM for your market?

Is  the  market  size  as  you  expected,  and  is  it  verified  by  customer
feedback and industry data?

Is the market growing significantly, with strong growth prospects?

Do  customer  conversations  verify  that  they’ll  buy  repeatedly  and  refer
others to do the same?

Did any unexpected competitive threats emerge?

The hard question to answer here is how many customers are “enough.”
This  question  must  be  answered  by  founders  and  investors  together,  with
everyone  on  the  proverbial  “same  page”  about  longer-term  goals  for  the
company  and  whether  results  to  date  point  toward  achieving  those  results.
type.  A  few
These  results  differ  widely  by  channel  and  product 
generalizations:

Enterprise software: Three or four earlyvangelists showing very strong
interest  might  well  be  enough,  provided  that  the  team  has  at  least  as
many  more  enthusiastic  prospects  in  the  pipeline.  Where  possible,
customers should come from multiple segments, and few or no segments
should be far behind the others in terms of interest in the product

Capital equipment: The “three or four” enterprise software rule applies
here,  too,  as  a  rule,  but  a  closer  look  at  results  of  customer  discovery
with  a  broader  range  of  customers  is  helpful.  Are  most  prospects
interested in the product largely as spec’ed, or does everyone want some
form of customization? Do discovery results point to a robust pipeline,

acknowledging that the sales cycle for capital goods can be quite lengthy

Consumer products: Whether it’s a new skateboard or a flat-screen TV,
more  than  a  handful  of  earlyvangelist  customers  is  almost  certainly
required—perhaps  20  or  30  or  more.  It’s  also  important  to  establish
serious interest in the channel where you expect to sell the product. If 15
people  want  to  buy  your  skateboard,  that’s  probably  not  convincing
enough for the Walmart buyer, for example

Web/mobile applications: Since customer discovery efforts should reach
at  least  several  thousand  prospective  users  or  customers,  a  web/mobile
app  should  almost  certainly  activate  at  least  100  apps  or  downloads  to
say  it’s  seen  “enough”  customer  response.  You  should  also  watch  the
percentages, to be sure the conversion rate is encouraging

Social  networks  and  “network  effect”  startups:  These  should  probably
attract  at  least  500  if  not  1,000  active,  engaged  users  to  be  able  say
they’ve attracted “enough.” If the site or app is free or a freemium (free-
to-paid),  that  number  should  be  at  least  three  times—preferably  five
times—larger,  since  it’s  so  much  easier  for  a  user  to  say  “yes”  to
something that’s free. Monitor the activation rate, and look as well at the
percentage  of  users  who  are  returning  regularly—say,  three  times  a
week—since they’re not only an indication of customer volume but also
point to the customers’ quality and engagement

If  the  team  is  talking  to  the  right  customers  but  feedback  says  the
product is wrong, something has to change. Reassess your customer segments
and get back outside to find a different set of customers, or consider changing
the  features,  product  configuration,  pricing,  or  other  business  model
elements.

Do We Know Who Our Customers Are and How to
Reach Them?

The previous step assures that there are customers “out there” who want your
product.  But  do  you  know  how  to  find  them  and  sell  to  them  with  an
affordable marketing or “get customers” budget? This verification step starts
by ensuring that you know “what a customer looks like.”

Can  you  draw  a  customer  archetype  for  each  of  your  key  customer
segments? Does it clearly point you to places where you can find them?

Can you draw a day in the life of a customer so you know how to pitch
the product to him?

Did  some  segments  respond  better,  faster,  or  with  larger  orders  than
others?

Did any new segments emerge, or should any be eliminated?

Do  customers  recognize  big  improvements  in  a  “day  in  the  life”  of
users?

Do you know what your customers read, trade shows they attend, gurus
they follow, and where they turn for new product information?

Can you draw your channel map, showing how the product moves from
your  startup  to  its  end  user,  along  with  the  costs  and  marketing/sales
roles of each step in the sales channel?

Try to measure your “get customers” cost and response rates objectively.
Review the real, “all in” costs (including staff time, overhead, whatever) of
activating or selling, say, 50 customers. When you add up all the costs (not

just the ad or AdWords costs themselves, for example), are you still confident
of  your  ability  to  get  lots  more  customers  at  roughly  the  same  cost  per
customer?

Look beyond your total “Get” budget to identify which programs were
most cost-effective, and do some homework to be sure that if, for example,
you  quintupled  your  e-mail  marketing  budget,  results  would  quintuple  as
well. This is the time to figure out how much you really need to spend to get
one  (or  50)  good  customer(s),  since  you’re  about  to  head  to  customer
validation, where spending will increase by a factor of 10 if not more!

If  a  significant  amount  of  customer  feedback  has  given  you  high
confidence in all these answers, there’s one more step—determining whether
you  can  consistently  acquire  customers  at  the  costs  outlined  in  your  “Get”
hypotheses.  Your  early  tests  of  the  Get  programs  should  have  given  you  a
good sense of that, so review the data collected. Don’t worry if the costs are a
little  high,  since  you’ll  be  optimizing  those  programs  as  you  ramp  them  up
during validation.

  Web/mobile  startups  should  be  far  smarter  about  answers  to  these
vital  “Get”  questions,  partly  because  they  can  be.  Is  the  response  best  on
Facebook, Twitter or Foursquare? Do people who eventually activate find the
site  or  app  most  frequently  via  AdWords,  textlinks,  natural  search  or  when
they read about it on blogs or hear about it from friends? You should know
this quite well based on even the earliest customer discovery testing you’ve
done.

Remember  to  look  beyond  mere  customer  acquisition  statistics  and
identify  the  activated  users  or  buyers  by  source  so  that  you  know  where  to
find lots more of them. Often you’ll discover that nothing works better than
person-to-person referrals, so look at that “Get” approach more closely. And
always look at the data for each customer segment or cohort separately, since
some customers will usually prove far easier to acquire than others.

Be sure to update the business model based on any changes in customer
acquisition  costs  discovered  in  this  review,  since  they’re  often  the  largest
costs your startup will confront.

Can We Make Money and Grow the Company?

Assemble Revenue Model Data

By this point, the team has assembled a massive amount of hard data about
pricing,  revenue,  costs  and  acquisition  and  marketing  costs,  among  others.
The data needs to be verified, with any gaps filled in along the way, which
may  entail  returning  to  learn  more  in  further  customer,  channel,  or  product
development discussions. The most important hard data to review includes:

summary  of  customer  report  cards,  indicating  potential  sales  revenue
expectations over time

market size estimates

channel cost and revenue potential summaries

pricing plan

customer acquisition costs

detailed  information  about  the  industry,  the  customers,  and  their
behavior

competitive product and pricing information

Combine this data to create an accurate net revenue forecast for at least
the  next  four  quarters  of  the  company’s  existence—the  customer  validation
phase—and,  if  possible,  another  year  beyond  that.  This  shouldn’t  be  a
precise,  to-the-penny  estimate  by  any  means.  Instead,  it’s  more  of  a  rough
“gut  check”  to  be  sure  that  the  company  will  emerge  from  customer
validation as a growing, profitable business. Take a close look at Figure 6.2, a

hypothetical  analysis  of  a  company  selling  both  via  its  own  website  and
through a physical channel. Average cost of customer acquisition is 40% of
revenue in this example. The data assembly is a four-part process:

1.  Compute  the  “best  estimate”  of  total  gross  revenue  the  company  will
receive  directly  from  customers,  quarter  by  quarter.  Review  results  of
customer  discovery  report  cards  and  “get  customers”  program  tests  as
well as market size estimates to estimate the company’s direct revenue
from customers quarter by quarter.

2.  Next, compute the amount of channel revenue (other than direct revenue
for  sales  to  end  users,  from  which  the  company  receives  100  percent).
Review the channel costs (margin, rep fees, promotional costs, etc.) and
deduct them from channel revenues.

3.  Add  the  net  channel  revenue  to  the  total  direct  revenue  by  quarter  to
figure total company revenue. Deduct quarterly operating costs from the
revenue.

4.  Compute all the costs of acquiring customers, recognizing that they will
most  certainly  change  quarter  by  quarter,  both  as  the  company  spends
more money on its “get customers” effort and as it acquires customers
more cost-effectively.

Sample Financial Analysis (Figure 6.2)

The  computation  should  deliver  a  reasonable  rough  estimate  of  the
company’s  revenue  expectations  across  its  next  four  (or,  preferably,  eight)
quarters. Consider developing this entire exercise three different ways, using

a  “good/better/  best”  approach  that  delivers  three  different  forecasts  or
business cases: high, best guess, and worst case.

This  analysis  all  by  itself  may  stop  the  pivot-or-proceed  process  in  its
tracks, as it often does, if the computation shows the company running out of
money within the year. The spreadsheet is a simple example of a rough “cash
burn”  computation  that  should  be  enough  to  send  any  smart  founder  back
through the discovery and validation processes, considering that the company
runs out of money 90 days from moving forward.

Looking  at  an  analysis  like  this,  the  founders  and  investors  should  be
highly  nervous  about  proceeding  to  spend  nearly  $2  million  on  customer
creation activities. The startup in this example has several options:

Raise another few hundred thousand dollars immediately in order just to
survive the year ahead

Reduce the spending on operations or customer acquisition costs

Cut staff or reduce founder salaries until break-even is achieved

Without taking any of these steps, the company will clearly not survive,

and it must return to refine its business model.

Key questions to review and discuss:

Have you translated market and market share findings into potential unit
sales and revenue?

Have you validated your pricing model with customers?

Are volume, demand, and purchase-frequency hypotheses validated?

Were  any  unanticipated  channel  costs  uncovered,  such  as  sales  reps’
salaries or promotional fees?

If  the  market  is  multi-sided,  have  all  costs  of  generating  “buy”-side
revenue been estimated?

Does  this  rough  forecast  point  to  a  scalable,  profitable  business  with
substantial exit value?

Pivot or Proceed?

This  is  either  the  beginning  of  the  end  or,  more  likely,  just  the  end  of  the
beginning.  It’s  where  you  must  acknowledge  that  an  estimated  one  idea  in
thousands morphs into a scalable, profitable big company with an exit value
of $100 million or more. The company has put a stake in the ground with a
series  of  hypotheses  and  tested  its  assumptions.  Potential  customers  have
validated  the  product,  and  a  base  of  prospects  has  evolved.  And  all  the
learning is captured in writing in the updated business model canvas and its
supporting  hypothesis  documents.  Now  it’s  time  to  honestly  assess  if  the
modified hypotheses provide a sound foundation for moving forward—not to
launch—to a larger-scale test in customer validation.

Summary questions to review and discuss:

Have we identified a problem lots of customers will eagerly pay to have
solved?

Does  our  product  solve  these  needs  distinctively,  cost-effectively  and
profitably?

If so, do we have a sizable market and a viable, scalable and profitable
business model?

Can we draw a day in the life of our customer before and after purchase
of our product?

Can we create an organizational chart of users, buyers and channels?

The  hardest  question  is  simple  and  needs  an  honest  answer:  do  the
customer discovery findings point to a big enough market that’s hungry for
the product? This is often a painful question and, sadly, more often than not

leads back almost to the beginning of customer discovery. While it’s a defeat
of  sorts,  it’s  far  better  to  confront  this  question  honestly  and  candidly,
ensuring  that  the  business  model,  properly  executed,  points  to  a  repeatable,
scalable, profitable business opportunity. Without one, the company faces a
painful road to ignominy.

Exhausting  as  the  customer  discovery  process  is,  it  often  requires
multiple  iterations  to  fully  understand  the  market  and  discover  customers
who can’t wait to buy. However, it’s never been easy to find the Holy Grail.
Until you do, take everything learned in Phases 1 through 3 to heart, modify
the presentations, go back to Phase 1 and do it again. Try out several markets
and  users.  Does  the  team  need  to  reconfigure  or  repackage  the  product
offering?  If  so,  modify  the  product  presentations  and  go  back  to  Phase  3
(solution presentation) and do it again.

If the team votes “all systems go,” there are two more steps to complete

before taking a deep breath and moving forward into customer validation.

Determine the Validation Checkpoints

It’s wonderful to have lots of soft, fuzzy metrics of success, but they seldom
deliver  success  to  startups.  Be  sure  that  every  hypothesis  has  a  clear,
measurable  “validation  checkpoint”  and  that  those  checkpoints  tie  into  the
business  model.  A  few  examples  of  the  kinds  of  checkpoints  to  test  in  the
customer validation phase:

Physical channel/business-to-business checkpoint examples:

We can close a sale in three meetings

One of six prospects will buy if we get to talk to VPs of finance

Customers will expand the number of users of our service by 25 percent
after six months

Customers will place an average of two orders per month

Web/mobile checkpoint examples:

Every new customer invites 10 friends, half of whom sign up

A third of our visitors will return to the site within a week

A  quarter  of  our  visitors  will  refer  an  average  of  1.5  friends  within  a
week

Average session duration will be 10 pages or minutes per visit

Average order size will be $50 in the customer’s first month

One hundred websites will promote traffic to our site at a CPM of less
than $X

One hundred websites will run our banners on a CPA basis

On to Customer Validation? Congratulations!

If you’ve gotten this far, you’ve changed your hypotheses many times. Some
were iterations, others were pivots. One of the best techniques to see how far
you’ve come is to show the canvases as a series of snapshots over time. You
can  do  this  by  putting  them  up  on  the  wall  or  clicking  through  a  series  of
PowerPoint slides. Either way, this visual presentation of the hypotheses and
your  tests  to  turn  those  guesses  into  hard,  cold  facts,  is  the  final  step  in
determining  whether  it’s  time  to  move  on  to  the  next  of  the  four  steps,
customer validation.

If  it’s  time  to  move  to  the  next  step,  congratulations!  This  is  a  major
achievement  and  warrants  celebration.  Customer  discovery  is  the  most
challenging,  powerful  step  you’ll  encounter  in  Customer  Development:
defining  a  product,  an  offer,  a  channel  and  pricing  for  a  product  that
consumers  are  eager  to  buy.  Hold  on  to  all  the  information  collected  from
customer  interviews  for  use  throughout  the  phases  of  customer  validation,
when actual selling will develop a sales roadmap for the company.

Customer  discovery  is  an  exhausting,  sometimes-frustrating  process.
However,  it’s  the  foundation  of  Customer  Development  and  thus  the
foundation  of  a  successful,  scalable  business.  The  checklists  found
throughout  this  book  recap  the  phases  of  this  step,  the  goals  of  each  phase,
and  the  deliverables  proving  that  the  goals  have  been  met.  With  that  done,
take  a  well-earned  vacation  or  a  long  weekend  to  celebrate.  You’ll  need  to
rest up before moving on to customer validation.

Introduction to Customer Validation

Along the journey we commonly forget its goal.

—Friedrich Nietzsche

in 

E.PIPHANY’S  FOUNDING  HYPOTHESES  WERE  typically  pretty  straightforward
and  “investable” 
the  mid-1990s,  when  software  companies  were
automating everything from accounts payable to network security, sales force
processes and even wine-cellar inventories. “Why not automate the marketing
department?” asked the founders, meeting in their modest living room. “After
all, most of the tasks like press releases and data sheets and customer letters
are repeatable processes.” Venture capital was raised and the company began
to build its product based on the founders’ vision.

However,  the  company’s  initial  idea  of  who  the  customer  was  and  the
problem  they  wanted  to  solve  was  just  plain  wrong.  The  company’s  later
success was due to the four passionate entrepreneurs’ willingness to listen to
customers and to the three painful pivots driven by customer feedback.

The Browser Breakthrough

During the ’90s, large corporations acquired different software applications to
automate  each  part  of 
their  enterprise—finance,  customer  support,
manufacturing,  and  sales  among  them.  But  the  data  these  applications
collected  were  accessed  via  reporting  tools  from  the  IT  organization.  More
important,  the  data  existed  in  “virtual  silos,”  with  each  functional  system
walled off from the other. The finance system didn’t talk to the sales system,
which didn’t know that the manufacturing system even existed. Queries like
“Compare  the  sales  data  of  green  dresses  versus  blue  ones  with  current
inventory  for  each  by  store,  and  contrast  the  gross  margin  by  region  to
calculate  discounts”  were  virtually  impossible  to  answer  to  because  they

required combining data from three incompatible applications. As a result, it
could often take days or even weeks to get a simple inventory-detail report.

then-radical 

E.piphany’s 

notion  was 

provide  managers
anytime/anywhere drill-downs and analysis in real time, without IT, through
a revolutionary new technology called a web browser. One of the company’s
key hypotheses was that the product should be a great fit for companies with
lots of customers, tons of data on each one, and a recurring need for fast new
data-driven, microsegmented marketing campaigns.

to 

An Epiphany at E.piphany

Early on, E.piphany assembled an advisory board. A key adviser was the VP
of database marketing at Schwab. She was incredibly generous with her time
and  said  the  system  might  work  in  their  application.  She  introduced  the
company  to  five  other  database  marketing  executives,  who  essentially  said,
“If you get a system working at Schwab, we’ll have to buy one as well.” You
couldn’t  get  much  better 
its  first
earlyvangelist and first market.

that.  E.piphany  had  found 

than 

But each time Schwab’s people looked at the system’s technical details,
they  politely  said  our  product  was  missing  a  key  feature  for  database
marketing. It took two meetings before the founders realized they understood
her  problem,  all  right,  but  the  solution—the  underlying  database  schema  of
the software—was missing the most important feature for solving it. It didn’t
include  “householding,”  and  without  this  feature,  she  could  never  buy  the
E.piphany  system.  (Householding,  well-known  among  database  marketers,
recognizes that two or more people at the same physical address live together
and,  in  Schwab’s  case,  often  invest  together.  This  feature  was  crucial  to
direct-marketers  who  didn’t  want  to  send  multiple  or  differing  ads  to  the
same  address.)  And  no  amount  of  sales  and  marketing  hand-waving  was
going to fix the problem.

It  was  a  major  mistake.  Until  this  meeting,  the  founders  hadn’t
understood the customer problem well enough to provide the correct solution.
E.piphany’s  co-founders,  Ben  Wegbreit  and  Steve  Blank,  joined  the
Schwab VP, and her engineering team in a deep technical discussion of what
the software needed to do for Schwab’s business and what was needed. Ben
asked five or 10 questions, everybody nodded and the meeting ended. On the
long ride back to E.piphany’s living-room office, Steve asked, “Ben, how do

we solve Schwab’s problem?”

After  a  moment  of  silence,  he  replied,  “Show  them  page  6  of  our

product spec.”

“What do you mean page 6? Our spec only has five pages!”
Ben looked at Steve and smiled. “Not anymore.”
They had just pivoted the product and refined the minimum feature set.
E.piphany’s  first  order  from  Schwab  came  the  week  after  they  demo’ed
householding.  Other  orders  followed  soon  after.  A  week  later,  the  founders
sat down to figure out what other feature they would toss out to make room
for this one.

E.piphany  would  go  through  two  additional  equally  painful  pivots
before  its  initial  public  offering,  but  that  “householding”  pivot  sold  the
founders on the “power of the pivot” value.

The  meeting  and  car  ride  from  Schwab  to  the  company  headquarters
illustrates the customer validation process every startup needs: a method for
validating the business model with real customers and orders.

Customer  validation  turns  hypotheses  into  facts  about  basic  questions

like:
     •   Do we understand the sales/user acquisition process?

   Is it repeatable?
   Can we prove it’s repeatable? (If our business model is single-sided
commerce, the only acceptable proof is enough full-price orders.)

   Can we get these orders/users with the current product?

     •   Have we tested sales and distribution channels?
     •   Are we confident we can scale orders/users into a profitable business?
     •   Have we correctly positioned the product and the company?

The Customer Validation Philosophy

Customer validation attempts to “test sell” at every stage. It runs a continuing
series  of  quantitative  pass/fail  tests  to  determine  whether  there’s  strong
enough  product/market  fit  to  justify  scaling  sales  and  marketing  spending.
Most  of  your  testing  effort  will  be  asking  people  to  give  you  an  order  or
engage  with  your  app  or  website.  At  this  point,  you’re  testing  the  entire
business model, not its individual components, even as you learn more details
about some, like price or channel.

Just as customer discovery was disorienting for experienced marketers,

          
          
          
the customer validation process turns the world upside down for experienced
salespeople  and,  in  particular,  those  with  sales  responsibility.  All  the  rules
sales executives learned while selling in physical channels at large companies
are not applicable to startups. In fact, they’re positively detrimental. It’s not
all about the launch party!

In  the  customer  validation  step,  you  are  not  going  to  hire  and  staff  a
sales  team.  You  are  not  going  to  execute  to  a  sales  plan  or  “the  sales
strategy.” The reality  is that  you  don’t  know  enough  yet  to  do  any  of  these
things. At the end of customer discovery, you have in hand firm hypotheses
about who will buy, why they will buy, and at what price they will buy. But
until those hypotheses are validated—with customer orders—they’re all little
more than educated guesses, even with the work invested to develop them.

From Business Model Canvas to the Sales Roadmap

In  customer  discovery  you  tested  some  of  the  hypotheses  of  your  business
model:

Value proposition: You affirmed it with a few dozen to a few hundred
people

Customer segments: You have a hypothesis about customer archetypes

Customer  relationships:  You  tested  several  “get,  keep  and  grow”
activities

Channel:  You  understand  your  key  channel  partners,  and  some  have
expressed interest

Revenue model: The company has an idea of how to price its offering

A  sales  roadmap  uses  all  you’ve  learned  from  customer  discovery  to
guide the creation of a sales funnel specifically for your company. It answers:

Who influences a sale? Who recommends a sale?

Who is the decision-maker? Who is the economic buyer? The saboteur?

Where is the budget for purchasing the type of product you’re selling?

How many sales calls are needed to make one sale?

How long does an average sale take from beginning to end?

What is the selling strategy? Is this a solution sale?

If so, what are “key customer problems?”

What’s the profile of optimal visionary buyers, the earlyvangelists every
startup needs?

Where will the traffic come from? Will it stick?

Will the product be strong enough to grow virally?

Unless a company has proven answers to these questions, few sales will
happen, and those that do occur will result from heroic single-shot efforts. Of
course, on some level, most sales VPs realize they lack the knowledge they
need to draw a detailed sales roadmap, but most believe they and their newly
hired  sales  team  can  acquire  this  information  while  simultaneously  selling
and closing orders. This is because most executives new to startups confuse
searching for a business model with the execution of a known business model.
A  sales  roadmap  is  part  of  the  search  for  a  business  model.  Only  after  it’s
built can it be executed. Startups can’t learn and discover while they’re busy
executing.  As  we  can  see  from  the  rubble  of  any  number  of  failed  startups,
attempting to execute before you have a sales roadmap in place is pure folly.

Building a Sales Roadmap Versus Building a Sales
Force

Given how critical the validation step is, a CEO’s first instinct is to speed up
the process by spending more on customer acquisition or adding salespeople.
The reality is, this doesn’t speed up the validation phase. In fact, it most often
slows  it  down.  Instead,  you’ll  build  a  roadmap  to  figure  out  how  to  get
repeatable sales (by explicitly testing product/ market fit). Once that’s done,
then build a sales organization.

Developing a sales roadmap is part of the search for

a business model.

In an existing market, customer validation may simply validate that the
sales  VP’s  rolodex  or  contact  list  is  relevant,  and  that  product  performance
metrics the company identified in customer discovery were correct. In a re-
segmented, clone or new market, even a rolodex of infinite size (or tripling
the  AdWords  budget)  won’t  substitute  for  a  proven  business  model  and  a
tested sales roadmap.

For  an  experienced  sales  or  business  development  executive,  these
statements  about  customer  validation  are  heretical.  All  the  actions  in
Customer Development we consider to be mistakes are what traditional sales
professionals  have  been  trained  to  do.  It  seems  counterintuitive  and
disorienting. So let’s look more closely at why the first sales in a startup are
so different from later-stage sales or selling in a large company.

Founders Must Lead the Customer Validation
Team

Founders  who  complete  customer  discovery  often  mistakenly  ease  up  and
delegate  customer  validation  activities  to  Sales,  Business  Development,
Marketing  or  Product  Management.  This  is  a  bad  idea.  Middle  and  junior
managers  aren’t  likely  to  be  good  at  customer  validation,  which  requires
creative  searching,  probing,  and  turning  on  a  dime—not  execution  of  a
repeatable process.

Why must the founders lead? First, founders and only founders call the
shots  on  pivoting.  To  do  so,  they  must  hear  about  flaws  in  the  product  or
business  model  directly  from  the  customers.  Nothing  else  has  the  same
impact.  Anyone  other  than  a  founder  who  learns  of  a  serious  product  or
business-plan flaw faces two challenges: he or she doesn’t have the authority
to  pivot,  and  he  or  she  seldom  has  the  courage  to  report  bad  customer
feedback to the founder.

  In  web/mobile  channels,  where  there’s  much  more  feedback  to
process, the founders still make the call about pivots, but the company needs
to have data junkies, A/B testers, statisticians, and SEO/PPC experts, as well
as  at  least  one  or  two  wildly  creative  online  marketers.  (This  might  be
physically  embodied  in  the  founder  and  one  or  two  amazing  people.)  This

 
team  will  measure,  assess,  manage  and  improve  the  acquisition,  or  Get
Customers,  funnel.  As  they’re  getting  “out  of  the  building”  digitally,  a
customer development team also leaves physically for face-to-face customer
validation, and for deal-making that drives traffic or referrals.

Validation Proceeds at Different Speeds in Different
Channels

It takes far more time to set up visits in a physical channel with prospects in
cellphone  companies  in  Asia  and  Africa  than  to  get  customer  feedback
electronically  for  a  website.  And  more  customers  can  be  reached  via
web/mobile channels than can ever be met face-to-face.

 Customer validation for web/mobile startups always proceeds faster
with  many  more  iterations  than  it  does  with  physical  channels  and  goods.
Why? It’s all bits that can be changed. Regardless of speed, the fundamental
principles of customer validation are identical across all channels.

Make Early Sales to Earlyvangelists

In  customer  validation  you  will  target  Earlyvangelists  as  your  first  paying
customers. (If you can’t sell to them, it doesn’t get better over time.)

Constrain Spending in Customer Validation

A  typical  failure  scenario  for  startups  is  premature scaling,  when  there  are
more  salespeople  in  the  field  burning  cash  than  are  needed  while  your
business  model  is  still  unproven.  Or  running  expensive  demand-creation
activities before you’re sure who your customers really are. Too often those
sales  people  are  fired  and  their  marketing  programs  killed  when  the  startup
faces a major pivot after scaling too early. Customer validation delays sales-
and-marketing  hiring  and  spending  until  validation  is  nearly  complete.  This
constraint  is  central  to  the  process,  which  assumes  startups  will  fail  and
iterate often. The spending constraint keeps enough cash in the bank to fund
multiple pivots on the road to success.

Prioritize What Needs to be Validated

Prioritizing  the  business  model  elements  that  need  validating  is  essential  at
the  start  of  customer  validation.  Every  startup  business  model  has  a  zillion
moving parts. Validation can’t possibly measure and affirm every variable or
the  founders  will  be  100  years  old  by  the  time  they’re  ready  to  scale—or,
worse, exit—the business.

The business model canvas is an excellent guide here. Most startups will
focus  on  the  four  core  elements:  value  proposition,  customer  relationships,
channel, and revenue model. This list works for many businesses but not all.
Multi-sided markets need to prioritize all sides of the market. Think about the
five or fewer things that will make this a huge, successful business—or not.

Why Accountants Don’t Run Startups

With all the process steps involved, it’s sometimes hard to remember that the
Customer Development process isn’t a giant focus group. The goal is not to
add  up  all  the  customer  feedback  and  vote  on  what  features  to  implement.
Founders who are artists at heart run startups—the true purpose of Customer
Development  is  to  inform their vision.  (In  a  new  market,  there’s  no  data  at
all!)  A  great  entrepreneur  may  consider  all  the  customer  data,  listen  to  his
instincts and say, “Here’s why I’m going to ignore what we just heard.”

 And Finally: Don’t Be Afraid to Let Go When

Lightning Strikes

Occasionally,  fast-scaling  web/mobile  startups  with  viral  or  network-effect
drivers  find  the  business  suddenly  blasting  off,  even  if  this  book  doesn’t
suggest  that  it  should  happen  yet.  This  occurred  at  Google,  YouTube,
Facebook, and Twitter, to name an elite few. If you’re lucky enough to hit a
consumer nerve as hard as they did, put this book down and hold on to the
rocket ship. After all, that’s what entrepreneurs do! (Skim the book another
time on your private jet or yacht or Sunfish.)

The Customer Validation Philosophy, in Summary

Customer  discovery  first  tested  your  hypotheses  about  the  company’s
business model with a relatively tiny group of customers who were asked for
opinions,  not  orders.  Discovery  itself  didn’t  deliver  any  proven,  hard  facts
about who would buy or how scalable the business was.

Customer  validation  goes  to  the  next  step  and  determines  whether  a
product/market fit can be validated by orders or usage. It does so by further
developing the MVP as well as the company’s sales and marketing plans and
materials. Then it gets founders out of the building (physically, virtually, or
both)  to  test  the  MVP  and  every  other  key  business  model  hypotheses,
including  product  features,  pricing,  channel,  and  positioning.  How?  By
asking for orders (or downloads, logons, or clicks)!

Test the MVP. How? By asking for orders.

Customer validation is complete when the company has answers to these

three questions:

1.  Can  the  business  scale?  Will  a  dollar  spent  on  customer  acquisition
yield  more  than  a  dollar’s  worth  of  incremental  revenue,  page  views,
downloads or clicks?

2.  Is  there  a  repeatable  and  scalable  sales  roadmap?  Does  the  company
know the right prospects to call on or acquire, and what to say to them to
consistently deliver sales?

3.  Is the sales funnel predictable? Do the same sales programs and tactics
consistently  deliver  an  adequate,  profitable  flow  of  customers  through
the funnel?

Now let’s get started.

Overview of the Customer Validation Process

 
Customer Validation: Overview of the Process (Figure 7.1)

Customer Validation has Four Phases

Phase  1  consists  of  six  “get  ready  to  sell”  activities;  product  positioning,
sales/  marketing  materials  for  “test  selling”  efforts,  the  hiring  of  a  sales

closer, the creation of a distribution channel plan, refining a sales roadmap,
and  creating  an  advisory  board.  These  activities  make  your  team  the  best
prepared early stage venture ever to hit the streets.

 Companies in web/mobile channels also have six “get ready to sell”
activities:  Product  Positioning,  assembling  Acquire/Activate  Plans,  building
the high-fidelity MVP, building the metrics toolset, hiring a “data chief” and
creating  an  advisory  board.  They  help  deliver  lean,  cost-effective  customer
acquisition programs.

Phase 2 gets founders out of the building to put the product to the ultimate
test:  will  customers  validate  your  business  model  by  buying  your  product?
You’ll attempt to actually sell customers an unfinished and unproven product
without a professional sales organization. Getting feedback is as important as
getting  orders.  Startups  in  the  physical  channel  do  this  with  brochures,
PowerPoints, sales materials and, where possible, product demos or mockups.
Dozens if not hundreds of meetings help refine the product presentation and
channel plans, validate the sales roadmap, prove the predictability of the sales
funnel,  and  validate  that  the  business  model  is  repeatable,  scalable  and
profitable in a real-world test.

 Web/mobile startups “go live” and get out of the building virtually to
see  if  their  plans  and  tools  to  acquire  customers  actually  attract  customers
who activate or buy. Do more than a handful of real customers behave as the
hypotheses  suggest  they  will?  Acquisition  and  activation  activities  are
measured and optimized.

Startups in multi-sided markets (physical or web/mobile) need to get out
of  the  building  to  test  each  side  of  the  market.  Web/Mobile  marketers  first
test users and then validate a different set of hypotheses (value proposition,
segment,  revenue  model,  etc.)  with  the  “payers,”  who  are  marketers  or
advertisers willing to pay to reach people using the site for free.

Phase  3  happens  once  you  have  a  couple  of  orders  under  your  belt  and
enough  customer  information  to  develop  and  refine  your  product  and
company  positioning.  The  positioning  is  tested  in  meetings  with  industry
pundits and analysts and face-to-face with the expanded customer audience.

  Web/mobile  startups  refine  their  “Get”  program  tactics.  Then  they
conduct  initial  product  positioning,  next  they  gather  and  organize  the
customer  behavior  data  collected  in  Phase  2:  customer  responses  to  “Get”

activities and metrics summarizing their initial on-site behavior. They collect
feedback about the MVP itself and the effectiveness of acquisition tools.

Phase  4  stops  all  activity  for  long  enough  to  conduct  a  detailed  pivot-or-
proceed analysis and verify that, regardless of channel, customer validation is
complete and the company knows how to scale. If so, it’s ready to reap the
rewards  for  founders  and  investors  alike.  But  first  there  are  lots  of  tough
questions and hard work to verify.

In  sum,  the  question  is  simple:  “is  this  a  business  worth  doing,”  and
devoting  several  years  of  backbreaking  work?  Will  it  generate  enough
revenue,  growth  and  profits  to  achieve  the  founders’  and  investors’  goals?
And has the team learned enough to make it happen?

Odds  are  overwhelming  that  the  optimum  business  model  won’t  be

found on the first or second try in validation.

The moment customer validation is over is when it’s clear that there are
real  orders,  users,  or  clicks—not  surveys  or  chats.  Customer  validation
confirms that customers will accept the minimum viable product, proves that
the customers exist, figures out how to reach them predictably, and crafts a
scalable plan to engage and sell many more. It’s often called the “epiphany
moment.”

CHAPTER 8

Customer Validation, Phase One: “Get
Ready to Sell”

PHASE 1 OF CUSTOMER VALIDATION PREPARES the tools to test the company’s
ability  to  acquire  customers.  In  this  phase,  you’ll  craft  your  product
positioning, which guides how you write the marketing, and online materials
needed for the sales effort. For companies in the physical channel, other steps
in this phase include development of collateral materials, channel sales plans,
and a sales roadmap. Sometimes, a “sales closer” is also hired at this point.
And you’ll finalize your advisory board.

  Web/mobile  channel  startups  develop  their  plans  and  tools  for
customer  acquisition  and  activation  as  well  as  a  dashboard  or  toolset  for
monitoring  the  results.  They  create  a  hi-fidelity  MVP  to  be  sure  the
acquisition efforts are valid.

Steps  in  this  first  phase  are  markedly  different  for  each  channel,  so
physical  and  web/mobile  channels  are  addressed  separately,  as  outlined  in
Figure 8.1.

When all these steps are in place, it’s time to get out of the building and
start selling, in Phase 2. Here are the steps each channel requires before you
are ready to sell.

Phase 1 – Get Ready to Sell (Figure 8.1)

Get Ready to Sell: Craft Positioning Statement

From your customer’s perspective, what does your company stand for, what
does your product do, and why should they care? You probably had an idea
when  you  started  the  company,  but  now  you  have  some  real  experience  in
interacting with customers. It’s time to revisit the product vision, features and
competitive  information  in  light  of  what  you’ve  learned  in  customer
discovery.

Can  you  reduce  all  that  you’ve  learned  into  a  single  clear,  compelling
message explaining why your company is different and the product is worth
buying  (or  spending  time  with).  That’s  the  goal  of  a  unique  selling
proposition.  A  unique  selling  proposition  builds  the  bond  between  you  and
your customer, focuses marketing programs, and becomes the focal point for
building the company. More relevant for this step, it gets the company’s story
down to a short “elevator pitch” powerful enough to raise a customer’s heart
rate.  It’ll  appear  in  lots  of  different  places  from  billboards  to  banners  and
business cards from here on out and helps focus sales and marketing efforts.
Don’t  worry  about  getting  it  perfect,  because  it  will  change  with  feedback
from customers, analysts, and investors. For now, take a first best shot.

While  positioning  messaging  seems  straightforward,  it  can  be  a
challenge to execute. It takes serious work to get to a pithy statement that’s
both understandable and compelling. It’s much easier to write (or think) long
than  to  write  (or  think)  short.  Start  by  revisiting  what  customers  said  they
valued during customer discovery. What were the top problems? Did a phrase
keep coming up to describe the problem or solution? Where does the product
affect customers most? How significant is the product’s impact? What does
the  new  offering  provide  that  competitors  can’t  or  won’t?  What  does  it  do
better? Think simple and short at all times. This may be a place where outside
creative resources are worth the investment.

In technology startups, one of the biggest challenges for engineers is to
realize  the  need  for  a  simple  message  that  grabs  customers’  hearts  and
wallets,  not  their  heads  and  calculators.  It’s  not  about  the  product  features.
Seek a simple sentence that condenses the entire value proposition into a few
pithy,  catchy  words  that  say  it  all:  “Think  Different,”  from  Apple;  “Don’t
Leave  Home  Without  It,”  American  Express;  “Just  Do  It,”  Nike;  “We  Try
Harder,”  Avis;  “Earth’s  First  Soft  Drink,”  Perrier;  “The  Ultimate  Driving
Machine,” BMW.

The exercises, in Figures 8.2 and 8.3, developed by Geoffrey Moore (of
Crossing the Chasm fame) early in his career as a marketing consultant, can
help evoke the necessary elements:

Product Positioning Statement (Figure 8.2)

Here’s how a mobile expense-reporting application, Mobiledough, might

have used the product position statement:

Product Positioning Statement Example (Figure 8.3)

What might Mobiledough’s tag line be? A few candidates:

“Your dough, on the go. Fast, accurate, online”

“Track your expenses while you’re makin’ tracks”

“Mobiledough. It just adds up, instantly, online”

Use  the  Geoff  Moore  outline  or  one  like  it  to  brainstorm  positioning
statements  with  the  Customer  Development  team.  Consider  a  companywide
contest  or  creative  session.  To  see  if  the  positioning  is  emotionally
compelling, think about the following:

Do customers’ heart rates go up after they hear it?

Do they lean forward to hear more? Or do you get a blank stare?

Is it understandable in the users’ language or unique in their minds?

For  B-to-B  products,  does  the  positioning  imply  a  cost  or  competitive
advantage for the product?

For  consumer  products,  does  it  save  time  or  money  or  provide  fun  or
love, glamour or status?

Finally, does the positioning pass the reality test? Claims like “lose 30
pounds  in  a  week”  or  “increase  sales  200  percent”  or  “fall  in  love  tonight”
strain  credibility  and  probably  legality  as  well.  Moreover,  it’s  not  only  the
claim that needs to pass this test. Is your company a credible supplier for the
product  you’re  describing?  When  selling  to  corporate  customers,  there  are
additional hurdles to think about. Are your capabilities congruent with your
claims?

One  last  thing  to  keep  in  mind  is  our  continual  question  about  what
market type you’re in. If you’re offering a product in an existing market, your
unique selling proposition is about better, faster, or higher performance. It’s
framed by what you’ve learned from countless customer interviews about the
basis of competition..

If  you’re  creating  a  new  market  or  trying  to  reframe  an  existing  one,
you’ll probably come up with a transformational unique selling proposition.
Transformational unique selling propositions deal with how the solution will
create a new level or class of activity—i.e., something people could never do

before.

Get Ready to Sell: Acquire/Activate Customers
Plan

  In  customer  discovery,  you  developed  a  rough  plan  to  acquire  and
activate  customers.  Now  it’s  time  to  refine  those  plans  and  build  the
acquisition and activation programs and tools. As a reminder:

Acquisition is where prospects first learn about, experience, or visit the
product,  site  or  app.  This  is  the  widest  point  in  the  company’s  sales
funnel and the customer’s first interaction with the company

Activation gets newly acquired customers to sign up, participate or buy,
or at the very least to identify themselves and move through the “Get”
funnel

Remember that “Get” activity is very different in web/mobile: you must
attract customers to your site, app, or product or they won’t even know you
exist!  Review  this  section,  which,  in  brief,  says:  figure  out  where  your
customers go when they’re searching for a solution; be visible and inviting in
as  many  of  those  places  as  possible;  and  “earn”  their  visit  to  your  product
with helpful, friendly information, not hard-boiled sales pitches.

PROCEED  WITH  CAUTION:  Remember,  this  is  an  overview.
There’s  no  way  you  can  implement  all  this  or  even  process  it  in  one
sitting. It’s a plan. Implementation happens later.

 
 
“Get Customers” Tools for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 8.1)

The “Acquire” Plan and Tools

The Acquire plan is short, to-the-point, and tactical in nature. The plan helps
you  find  tools  that  predictably  deliver  large  numbers  of  “good”  customers
(who engage with or spend heavily on the site or app) into the widest point of
the funnel (at the left) at the lowest cost per customer.

The “Get Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 8.4)

WARNING: There is no possible way you can read, process and act on
this  section  in  one  read.  There’s  a  lot  here.  Skim  it  first,  then  go  back
and read each section. Then think about what action you need to take for
your startup.

 
The Acquire plan (see sample plan) should fit on a single page. It details

the first set of Acquire activities to test and includes:

Who: Who’s responsible for driving the program; who will add support
or expertise

What: Describe the tactic and its parts (see below for a list of tools)

Budget: Estimate of spending for the first round of testing

Timing: Outline the steps needed to launch (our example in Figure 8.5
uses a four-week cycle)

Why: Specific, measurable acquisition goals of each plan element

Multi-sided or not: Do you have users, or users and payers?

The  acquire  plan  and  tactics  will  change  repeatedly,  since  in  customer

validation they’re basically a series of experiments.

The acquire plan and tactics will change
repeatedly... they’re basically a series of
experiments.

In  a  physical  consumer  channel  like  Walmart,  marketers  seldom  know
which  consumers  see,  touch,  or  buy  any  particular  product.  But  in  the
web/mobile  channels,  every  aspect  of  consumer  behavior  can  be
instrumented,  analyzed  and,  often  as  not,  optimized  to  improve  business
performance. Be sure your product is instrumented to track every consumer
action or inaction. Without building the instrumentation upfront, optimizing
your acquisition activities is more challenging, if not downright impossible.

A Sample Acquire Spreadsheet

Shown in Figure 8.5 is a sample of part of an Acquire plan for a web startup
with a small budget. The plan is built around a few key assumptions:

     Who: Two staffers are needed, one full-time and one half-time

 
 
     What: The tactics, chosen by the team, seem best-suited to maximizing

leads and sales (see next section for a list of tools)

     Budget: The startup has about $25,000 to spend for this

A Sample Acquire Plan and Timetable (Figure 8.5)

     Timing: The team is allowing itself four weeks to prepare all elements for

the launch of validation

     Why: The goal is to get 30,000 to 35,000 customers to download a free
trial and to get 15 percent of them to convert to paying customers. This
would achieve a customer acquisition cost of about $5, as suggested in

this plan’s revenue model hypothesis

     Multi-sided or not?: Does your product have both users and payers? If so,

a multi-sided market requires a separate plan for each “side” of its
market. Users will be acquired one way, while reaching and selling
advertisers will demand a totally different approach. (Our sample is a
single-sided market)

Guidelines for Developing the Acquire Plan

Determining  whom  to  acquire  (i.e.,  which  customers,)  what  promotional
tactics to use, and what to say and how to say it (the content and messaging)
is made easy because you did most of the research and planning in customer
discovery.  Start  this  plan  by  referring  back  to  three  hypothesis  documents
you devised when you created and tested your original business model canvas
hypotheses:

Customer  segments:  customers  to  be  reached  (which  guides  e-mail,
targeting of marketing activities, ads, and PR)

Customer relationships: how customers will be reached (SEO, PPC, e-
mail, PR, etc.)

Value  proposition:  what  will  excite  customers  and  persuade  them  to
engage, visit or buy

Don’t be afraid to update or change the hypotheses based on the latest
feedback or even instinct at this point, since they’re still just “best guesses”
confirmed by only a few customers. Other guidelines to keep in mind:

Remember  that  this  is  a  test  to  figure  out  which  tools  work  and  cost-
effectively  when  they’re  launched  during  customer  creation,  the  next
step. This is not a company or product launch. Your goal is learning, not
revenue, so don’t be afraid to test lots of alternatives

Define  success  upfront  for  each  test,  using  a  pass/fail  metric  (such  as
“one in five people will click”), and monitor results

Be the greatest, friendliest, coolest thing going. Your job is to attract or
invite  customers  to  your  product,  site,  or  app,  so  be  interesting  and

welcoming (and, if appropriate, even fun or funny) rather than not just
offering a hard, cold sale. Think like your customers, and be prominent
and  visible  where  you  think  they’ll  be  searching  for  a  solution  like
yours. (Think about forums and online communities)

Running tests without collecting data is a cardinal
sin.

Instrument  everything.  Running  tests  without  collecting  data  is  a
cardinal  sin.  Engineering  needs  to  spend  the  extra  effort  to  collect  all
it  can  be  measured  and  optimized
customer  behavior  data  so 
continuously. Confront this upfront, as it’s hard to “bolt on” later

Don’t  start  everything  at  once,  since  that  will  create  chaos  both  in  the
market  and  in  the  company.  For  example,  start  search  engine
optimization  and  pay-per-click  tests  on  Day  Five,  and  add  e-mail  and
affiliate  marketing  programs  two  or  three  weeks  later.  The  individual,
program-by-program results will be easier to identify and measure

Don’t  spend  more  than  $2,000  or,  if  well-funded,  $10,000  to  test  any
one thing. The startup usually can’t afford it at this stage, and the risks
of guessing wrong are too great

When a test seems to be working, ramp it up to be sure it withstands the
test  of  scale.  If  a  $2,000  e-mail  marketing  campaign  is  performing,
double it, refine it and do it again

Choose  agency  partners  very  carefully,  if  at  all.  The  costs  and
management  time  needed  to  hire  a  pr,  ad,  or  web  agency  this  early  in
your startup make it a very risky proposition. Most often, agencies are
great  at  execution  of  programs  but  not  at  developing  and  testing
strategies. Rely on founders and staff where possible, as they know the
product  and  the  business  model  best.  Consider  freelance  talent
specialized in developing tests and strategies or those who specialize in
specific tasks (e.g., pay-per-click, demos and other specialized skills) if
they don’t exist within the company

Don’t launch the Acquire effort by itself.  Activation  programs  must  be

 
ready  to  “catch”  the  customers  you’ve  acquired,  so  if  there’s  copy
saying, “Sign up today and get a free box of chocolates,” for example,
the site’s back-end system has to be operating, the chocolates have to be
ready to ship, and copy for the thank-you e-mail must be ready to go. If
you’re  taking  customers’  money,  all  back-end  systems  need  to  be
working,  including  such  elements  as  receipts,  credit-card  processing,
and customer service. Similarly, site and app instrumentation must be up
and  running,  tested  and  feeding  the  management  dashboard  so  it  can
measure the behavior of every customer who passes through the funnel.
Remember that acquisition by itself is one of several integrated pieces of
the  “Get”  strategy  (there’s  also  activation,  retention,  and  “grow
customers,” to name a few).

The acquisition plan is managed through close monitoring of every step
customers  take  as  they  move  through  the  sales  or  “get  customers”  funnel.
That monitoring, generally in a dashboard, enables constant effort to improve
performance  or  “throughput”—customers  movement  from  one  step  to  the
next—at  every  step  of  the  funnel,  using  tools  detailed  in  the  next  section,
“optimizing the acquire plan.”

Acquire Plan Tools

Acquisition tools you can buy

The  list  of  customer  acquisition  tools  you  can  buy  and  use  is  virtually
endless,  but  their  customer  impact  and  effectiveness  vary  over  time.
Acquisition  is  a  numbers  game  based  on  your  ability  to  cost-effectively
deliver large volumes of customers to your site or app. Basic tools include:

search-engine marketing

e-mail marketing

outreach to bloggers

affiliate marketing

online lead generation

Acquisition Tools You Engineer Into Your Product

In  addition  to  the  tools  you  buy  and  deploy,  build  social  network  and  viral
components  into  your  product  itself  to  create  the  most  powerful  acquisition
tool of all. First, it’s fundamentally free, making it obviously the most cost-
effective!  Second,  it  can  be  remarkably  fast,  as  seen  in  the  skyrocketing
growth  of  social-media  and  photo-sharing  sites,  among  others.  As  a  bonus,
it’s  highly  likely  that  the  first  customers  attracted  to  the  new  product  will
know others who are also interested and will personally endorse and refer the
product, app, or site to them.
Three distinct types of social networks and network effects aid acquisition:

     Word of mouth, the most prevalent, encourages happy customers to share
news of their new-found product or service with friends and business
associates. It brings a personal friend-to-friend endorsement that’s
extremely powerful

     Sharing allows others to use and share articles, demos, and sample code so

people can re-Tweet and use it on social media, RSS feeds, etc.

     Direct network effects: People who want to share photos, make free calls,
or have free video chats with friends need their friends to use the service,

 
 
so they invite them to join

A great test of how your product fits is asking your early customers, “On
a  scale  of  1  to  10  (with  10  being  the  best),  would  you  recommend  this
product  to  your  friends?”  If  your  product  doesn’t  rank  9  or  10,  it  has  little
word of mouth or network effect.

Some products are inherently viral...

Some  products  are  inherently  viral,  some  aren’t.  Some  can  be
engineered  to  do  so.  For  example,  every  sent  Gmail  message  ends  with  the
tag  line,  “Invite  (recipient)  to  Gmail.”  It  uses  the  e-mail  “send”  process  to
expand the network and Gmail’s user base.

Encourage early customers or visitors to promote the product and your
company to friends and business colleagues at every opportunity. Give them
materials (e-mails, mailable links or demos), and consider rewarding them for
doing  so,  as  many  online  marketers  do.  This  tactic  is  highly  cost-effective
and credible when done right, in large measure because it brings with it the
sender’s implied endorsement.

Develop  simple  widgets  or  links  that  make  it  easy  for  early  visitors  or
customers to “like” the product, company or both on Facebook or to Tweet
about it. Create YouTube videos and other shareable content that encourages
exploration of the product. People respond to their friends’ likes and dislikes
and  are  more  apt  to  explore  something  recommended  by  a  friend  than
something they see in an e-mail or an ad. Create robust profiles of company,
product and users wherever possible on Facebook and other relevant social-
networking  sites.  Provide  valuable  information  of  interest  to  prospective
customers rather than purely self-serving messages.

You  might  also  want 

to  consider  creating  separate,  unbranded
experiences  (sites,  blogs)  that  are  specifically  geared  toward  the  problem
your  product  or  service  is  intended  to  solve.  For  example,  a  game  startup
might  create  a  site  dedicated  to  “cheats”  hints  and  tips.  A  medical-device
company selling gastric bands might have a site dedicated to weight loss.

The Activation Plan and Tools

 
While  the  previous  step,  acquisition,  brings  prospects  to  the  doorstep  (your
home page/landing page,) activation gets them to engaged with a sign-up, a
free or paid download, a click on something, game play, or a post on a site.
However  you  engage  the  user,  activation  is  the  critical  choke  point  in  the
sales  funnel,  where  the  customer  begins  a  relationship  with  the  product  or
company  as  a  member,  user,  subscriber,  player,  or  buyer.  Whether  you’re
asking for sharing, playing, participation or an order, this is the place where a
first-time visitor crosses the threshold to become an active user of your site or
app.

The “Get Customers” Activation Activities in Web/Mobile Channels
(Figure 8.6)

In  the  activation  step,  users  decide—all  by  themselves—whether  to
engage with or buy your product, and the decision is often made in a matter
of seconds. So the home or landing page must work hard and fast to activate
newly  acquired  “lookers,”  converting  them  into  buyers,  users,  or  tryers.
(Activation  sometimes  happens  in  an  app  store,  via  e-mail,  through  the

channel, or by telephone.) If you can’t get people to activate at once, ideally
you can get them to at least sign up so they can perhaps be persuaded to try,
engage, or buy later.

The landing page is where activation most often begins. (Figure 8.7)

Wherever  the  customer  arrives,  he  or  she  typically  knows  little  if
anything  about  where  he  or  she  has  just  landed.  Here’s  what  you  need  to
address to activate a customer, using an oversimplified example of what goes
through the visitor’s mind on arrival:

Why am I here? They want me to buy this new online multiplayer game

What makes it special? Oh, here’s a feature list and reasons to buy

How do I know it’s any good? Here’s a demo, list of endorsements, user
quotes, etc.

Where  do  I  get  more  information?  I  see  buttons  pointing  to  free  trials,
more info, etc.

Next?  What  does  the  company  want  me  to  do?  Oh,  click  here  to  try/
buy/sign up

Guidelines for Developing the “Activate” Plan

In the customer validation phase, the activation plan is really a test plan, A/B-
testing  every  key  aspect  of  the  home/landing  page,  from  color  and  copy  to
offers  and  navigation.  It’s  OK  to  start  with  approximations  or  guesses,  but
they should iterate rapidly based on measured customer responses.

Should  a  landing-page  offer  scream  “free”  or  subtly  ask  for  a  credit
card?  Should  the  “buy  now”  button  be  elegant  and  on  top  or  bright  orange
and  huge  in  the  lower  right-hand  corner?  Does  an  animated  product  demo
activate more users than a simple graphic? There are scores if not hundreds of
variables  on  almost  any  home  page,  and  many  tests  must  be  repeated  more
than  once  to  confirm  results.  Outside  information  architects  and  design
professionals can help. They understand the range of tools available as well
as the latest tricks of the trade in this highly creative process.

The  list  of  tools,  tricks,  and  variables  to  try  is  nearly  endless,  and  it’s
hard  to  predict  which  ones  will  win.  That’s  why  repeated  testing  and
measurement are so important, following the “test, measure, tweak” approach
discussed earlier.

Here’s what an activation plan should include:

Two types of action steps: Activation happens both on and off the home
page, so create two separate lists of the “Get” customers activities you
plan to test (like offering a premium with every signup)

First/second  test:  This  is  customer  discovery,  where  you’re  running
small-scale  tests  of  your  activation  programs.  Each  of  those  programs
needs to be tested at least twice, if not far more frequently, as you try to
find the program that’ll generate the most users or customers. Identify at
least the first two tests

Pass/fail test: Every test should have a “pass/fail,” or an expectation that
defines  what  “success”  will  look  like  if  you  have  it.  Based  on
experience, trials, or research, identify the metric that’ll determine if the
experiment was a success

An “Activate” Plan Example

Most  activation  happens  on  the  home  or  landing  page,  where  you’re  doing
anything you can to get a user or customer you’ve acquired (he or she came
to your page) and trying to engage them—get them to click, sign up, post a
comment, play, or buy.

The home page is “where the action is” for
activation.

And while the home page is “where the action is” for activation, there
are other things you can also do—like send follow-up e-mails, for example—
to further engage someone who’s expressed more than a passing interest.

Table 8.2 is a simplified example of what an activation plan might look
like for a social network where new golfers can offer and solicit improvement
tips. In this example, since the business is in a multi-sided market, activation
goals  include  such  non-monetary  actions  as  registration,  inviting  friends,
asking a question or answering one.

 
Sample Activation Plan for a Golfers’ Social Network (Table 8.2)

Tools for the Activate plan

Activation happens both on and off the home page. Key tools to consider for
each are in the bullet points that follow.

On the home or landing page

The  landing  page  itself  offers  lots  of  ways  to  drive  activations,  including
content, look and feel, and navigation. It can also showcase these activation
tools:

product demos

free trials

customer contact tools

animation

Non-home page acquisition tools

While the home page is the primary activation tool, consider these others too:

e-mail cascades

price/incentives

traditional tools

On the home or landing page itself:
Start with Content, Look and Feel, Functionality
and Navigation

Good  landing  pages  bear  little  resemblance  to  online  brochures.  They’re
invitations to “activate now,” working hard to invite customers to engage or
interact with—or buy—the product. This must happen literally at once, often
in seconds. Otherwise the customer (and the money spent to acquire him or
her  in  the  previous  step)  vanishes  with  the  click  of  a  mouse.  Develop  the
home/landing page along four axes:

1.  Content: Does the site present everything for a customer needs to make
the  “activation”  decision  simply,  in  multiple  places  (for  example,  does
every page say “join now”)? Is it friendly, informative, and inviting?

2.  Look and feel: Does the appearance relate to the audience (“corporate”
for  business  apps,  “serious”  for  financial  sites,  “edgy”  for  teen  or
skateboarding  products)?  Does  it  match  the  typical  style  of  the
demographic or their country?

3.  Functionality:  What  tools,  widgets,  configurators,  demos  or  other
devices can quickly engage customers, get them experimenting with and
experiencing the product itself, and figuring out what it costs, how much
time it would save, or how the game plays?

4.  Navigation/structure: How is information organized? How accessible is
it?  How  easy  is  it  for  users  to  complete  high-value  tasks  (ordering,
searching, etc.)?

Here’s how to approach each area.
Home/Landing Page Content:

          •      Tell  me  how  I  got  here!  Users  arrive  at  the  home/landing  page  in  a
variety  of  ways  (clicks,  e-mails,  referrals),  but  don’t  assume  they
know  where  they’ve  landed.  Welcome  them;  explain  the  site
(“Welcome  to  the  No.  1  online  gaming  portal.”)  to  avoid  fast
abandonment

     •   Reinforce the “scent” of the e-mail, ad, or tool that drove the customer
to  the  page.  Use  similar  verbiage  (and  look  and  feel)  to  increase
confidence that the viewer has come to the right place

          •      Issue  a  clear  call  to  action.  The  “pitch,”  or  call  to  action,  tells  the
customer what you want him or her to do. It should reflect positioning
developed in Stage 1 of validation, whether it’s “buy now,” “sign up,”
or  “attend  a  seminar.”  Use  redundant  calls  to  action  wherever  you
can, but be sure they’re not confusing. Clearly tell visitors what to do
and  why  doing  so  delivers  value  to  them.  The  landing  page  should
always accomplish the following:

   Explain what problem the product solves and why it’s important to

users and worthy of their attention

   Communicate ease of use and installation for the product

   Clearly explain how the product works

   Provide fast proof that it works (user quotes, competitive analysis,

demos, etc.)

Calls to action appear three ways on a home/landing page: hyperlinks,
buttons,  and  forms.  They  should  stand  out  and  be  obvious  to  every  visitor.
Highlight product features that make the most powerful pitch for activation or
purchase, and always provide easy access to more information about all the
above.

Some guidelines for home or landing page content development:

Encourage  me  to  “experience  the  offer:”  Never  think  of  the  landing
page  as  a  brochure.  It’s  effective  only  if  it  encourages  customer

          
          
          
          
engagement,  trial,  or  purchase.  All  content  should  invite  involvement,
and  offers  should  be  judiciously  sprinkled  throughout  headlines,
graphics  and  text,  including  “try  now”  textlinks  embedded  at  least
occasionally in body copy

Offer multiple calls to action ranging from “buy now” and “learn more”
to  “download  our  white  paper”  and  “talk  to  someone.”  Remember  to
make  one  of  these  far  more  prominent  than  all  the  others—the  action
most desired by the company

Write  short!  Web  visitors  are  very  fragile,  temporary  guests.  Respect
their  short  attention  spans  and  get  to  the  point  before  they  depart.  The
best  calls  to  action  are  generally  written  in  10  or  fewer  words  and
displayed in an easily readable font

Be specific. One of the most powerful page elements should be the core
in  Step  1  of  customer
product-positioning  statement  developed 
validation.  Succinctly  tell  users  why  they  should  buy  or  use  what  the
company’s selling

Use  bold  graphics  such  as  snipes  or  bursts  on  the  landing  page  to
promote a mobile site.

to  encourage  mobile
Deploy  contests,  promos  and  sweepstakes 
downloads.  These  are  highly  valuable  in  the  online  space—both  for
users, who can redeem such offers immediately, and for startups, which
can test and adjust offers on the fly

Manage your content inventory. Content should build credibility for the
company,  presenting  it  as  solid,  established,  and  ready  to  do  business.
Information on most of the following should be accessible from the landing
page:

product detail and information about the solution

customer lists and success stories

customer resources and support

vendor partners

company background

current news and events

company contact information (postal, phone, and e-mail)

the company’s privacy policy

Look and Feel

Design  the  home  or  landing  page  for  maximum  impact  and  minimal
confusion.  Always  provide  the  user  with  multiple  pathways  to  the  desired
“activation”  action,  whether  it’s  subscribing,  posting,  playing  or  buying.
Strive for fewer, crisper design elements, not more, keeping national cultural
differences in mind when designing. (The advice below is for the U.S., where
users  expect  websites  to  look  clean  and  simple.)  In  some  other  countries,
including  China,  users  expect  more  design  elements,  which  may  look
cluttered to a Western eye.

Keep it clean and simple, without too many distractions from the call to
action

Pick one promotional message and drive it the hardest at the expense of
others. Make it more prominent, supported by other things on the page,
and  compelling,  along  the  lines  of  “free  trial  download”  or  “special
introductory pricing this month”

Leave  plenty  of  white  space.  Crowded  pages  are  clearly  a  turnoff.  An
overbearing  number  of  graphic  elements  (art,  type,  buttons,  etc.)  will
frustrate and distract users

Use visuals. Whether using graphics, videos, demos, or diagrams, don’t
rely on copy itself to maintain user interest. Web visitors have extremely
short  attention  spans.  Keep  the  diagrams,  charts  and  graphics  simple.
Use animation carefully to add interest

Use interactivity.  The  web  allows  customer  interaction  with  the  brand,
something no other medium allows. (If these kinds of tools aren’t on the
site, you’re not using the web to its fullest potential)

Use  big  buttons.  “Download”  or  “buy  now”  or  “sign  up”  should  be
graphically interesting, sizable and easy to spot

Navigation and Functionality

Navigation is really about two things: the logical organization of information
and the shortest routes to task completion.

“Friendly”  navigation  provides  users  several  “routes”  to  the  call  to
action.  Routes  might  take  a  user  to  a  demo,  to  customer  testimonials,  to  a
white paper, or to a list of product features. Since nobody can predict what a
customer wants to do next, each pathway should easily lead to “buy now” or
another call to action.

Confusing navigation is the “foe,” offering too many choices, confusing
buttons,  textlinks  and  a  hodgepodge  of  options  a  user  might  choose.  This
often leads to higher abandon rates.

Overall Website Functionality:

          •      Use  tools  to  invite  customer  engagement.  Video,  animation,  demos,
configurators  and  other  devices  should  provide  customers  multiple
ways to engage with the product itself, any way they’d like. “Take a
tour (of our product)” and “play now” and “forecast your retirement
needs”  are  typical  engagement  invitations,  and  each  is  far  more
powerful  than  offers  like  “read  more”  or  “learn  about...”  Some
examples:

                    1.  “Enter  your  age/answer  three  questions  to  learn  how  little  this

insurance costs”

          2. “Click here to see Facebook friends’ photos on our site”

          3. “Pick your character and start talking to him now”

          4. “Find young single women in your neighborhood right now”

          5. “What’s your favorite golf ball? Click here for deep discounts. Free

shipping!”

     •   Use a demo to engage users with the product and show off its features
and ease of use. Make the demo more compelling (and under a minute
long)  than  a  PowerPoint.  When  possible,  draw  users  into  an  actual,
functioning component of the product (“put your data here” or “play
this brief version.”). The demo should end at the call to action

Engage users with the product and show off its
features.

     •   Offer free trials. Not to be confused with a freemium pricing strategy, a
free  trial  offer  can  be  restricted  by  limiting  the  free  version’s
functionality or duration (as in “try it free for two weeks”). Follow up
with a series of e-mails that introduce features, offer tips, and provide
reasons  to  buy.  Where  it  makes  sense  financially,  follow  up  with
telesales

     •   Click to contact. Particularly for commerce and paid subscription sites
(and probably too costly for freemium or multi-sided startups), offer
several  ways  for  prospects  to  contact  the  company.  This  can  be  as
simple  as  a  clickable  link  that  spawns  an  e-mail  to  the  sales
department or a form for requesting more information or a call from
Sales.  Many  commerce  sites  use  real-time  live  voice  and  chat
technology to engage quickly with prospects and enhance the chances
of activation

     •   Use animation. Interactive configurators, calculators, animated demos,
microsites, and many other utilities can bring the product to life and
engage  the  customer.  These  can  be  developed  inexpensively  by
outside  sources  found  online.  Some  websites  launch  brief  welcome
videos or quiet, animated demos that load automatically when a user
gets  to  the  site,  but  only  play  on  demand  (so  it  doesn’t  annoy  the
visitor  or  drive  her  away).  Use  animation  sparingly,  as  it  can  be
jarring

     •   Incorporate source-driven pages: Create multiple landing pages and
match  each  one  to  the  source  of  the  click  that  brought  users  to  the
page. “Welcome, Yahoo friends” would almost certainly increase the
visitor’s comfort and click-through rate, as would a “special offer for
Yahoo  e-mail  customers”  that,  oddly  enough,  is  the  same  offer
presented to Gmail customers or on a slightly different landing page

An entire industry has emerged around tools to
encourage customers to take action.

 
An entire industry has emerged around tools to encourage customers to
take  action  while  at  a  company’s  website.  New  home-page  tools  are
developed regularly, and some grow in popularity while others fade. This is
an  area  where  a  modest  amount  of  time  spent  on  online  research  about  the
latest  tools  can  pay  off.  In  addition,  freelance  or  small-agency  experts  in
activation  tests  might  be  helpful  (just  remember  that  you  don’t  want  to  run
major  programs  yet,  just  experiments).  Check  www.steveblank.com  for  the
latest tools.

Beyond the Home Page itself, Consider these
Additional Activation Tools:

E-mail cascades:  E-mail  addresses  are  difficult  to  acquire,  since  customers
resist registering, knowing that sales e-mails will follow. Think of customers’
e-mail  addresses  as  valuable  assets:  prospects  willing  to  be  sold.  Develop
sequences  of  three  e-mails  that  strike  a  balance  between  brevity  and
enthusiasm  for  the  product  and  its  features,  and  stress  key  elements  of  the
value  proposition.  Each  e-mail  should  highlight  different  features  or  other
reasons to buy and, where possible, tailor the message to reflect the source of
the  sign-up  (referring  site,  location  on  website).  Every  e-mail  should  have
multiple  calls  to  action,  both  in  textlinks  and  via  a  visible  graphic  “action”
button, along with offers of further information and, of course, an easy way
to unsubscribe. Compare the tradeoffs of HTML and text e-mails, since many
mail servers block HTML e-mail.

Price/incentives:  As  discussed  in  detail  in  the  section  on  revenue  model
hypotheses  in  Chapter  3,  pricing  can  be  another  activation  tool:  free,
freemium,  special  offers,  and  volume  discounts  can  all  be  used.  To  avoid
cannibalization  of  the  company’s  revenues,  consider  making  the  special
discount  offer  as  a  follow-up,  after  the  prospect  has  declined  the  full-price
offer at least once.

Traditional  tools:  Don’t  overlook  a  wide  range  of  traditional,  non-digital
marketing  tools  when  it  comes  to  activating  customers.  Contests  are  often
used (“win 500 frequent flyer miles” or “get a free tote bag,” for example), as

 
are sweepstakes (“you could win a free trip”). Outbound telemarketing can be
a  powerful  tool  to  active  folks  who  register.  Direct  mail  can  sometimes  be
used  cost-effectively,  as  can  traditional  media  advertising,  where  you  can
consider using QR codes.

Whatever  the  tool,  test  it  during  customer  validation  and  measure  the
result  as  well  as  the  resulting  cost  per  activation.  Compare  the  costs  of
acquiring  active  users  with  traditional  vs.  online  tools  and  consistently
optimize for the lowest cost per active user. If your test seems to work in a
controlled  test,  expand  the  test  and  try  again  to  see  if  the  program  scales.
Much more on this in Phase 2.

Managing the Activate Plan

Close  management  of  activation  tests  step  is  vital.  In  the  next  step,
optimization,  we’ll  discuss  the  use  of  dashboards  to  measure  performance
and  cost-efficiency  of  each  activation  program  individually.  However,  as  a
first  step,  a  simple  “funnel”  can  be  used  to  monitor  activation.  Here’s  an
example:

Example of a Simple Activation Funnel (Figure 8.8)

This  funnel  monitors  prospects  as  they  move  through  each  step  of  the
activation  process.  In  this  example,  only  one  website  visitor  in  10  (10
percent)  signs  up  for  the  free  trial.  Worse,  only  9  percent  of  that  group
actually  activates,  becoming  users  of  the  product.  And  only  a  very  small
subset  of  that  group  moves  on  to  become  active  users  of  the  product  or
service.  In  this  simple  example,  the  company  will  need  to  attract  literally

millions of “free trial” sign-ups in order to build a sizable number of active
users—a daunting challenge indeed.

Get Ready to Sell: Build a High Fidelity MVP

  Customer  discovery  used  your  two  MVPs  to  rapidly  test  and  iterate
prototypes  to  learn  about  the  problem/need  and  solution.  The  goal  of  the
MVP in customer discovery wasn’t sales, just customer feedback.

This  step  tests  the  high  fidelity  minimum  viable  product.  It’s  a  more
featured complete and polished functional version of the one used in Phase 3
of customer discovery. It still does not offer all the features and functionality
the  ultimate  product  vision  will  deliver.  Why  hi-fidelity?  As  customer
validation invites more users to the product to test acquisition and activation
tactics, the hi-fidelity MVP improves the test results, since visitors don’t feel
as  if  they’re  looking  at  a  second-class  product  even  if  the  MVP  is  an
incomplete rendering of the product, as is often the case.

What does “part” of a product look like? It might be a multiplayer game
with  five  levels  of  play  instead  of  the  20  or  50  that  will  eventually  be
included. A social network could have limited features that don’t allow photo
sharing  or  provide  users’  locations  but  facilitates  easy  interaction  and
navigation. An online shoe store might have only women’s casual shoes as a
start,  or  it  might  not  offer  odd  sizes  while  providing  a  superb  e-commerce
experience. If features aren’t live for the customer validation tests, consider a
page or several highlighting features that are “coming soon,” but don’t make
it too prominent, since the objective is to test-sell the MVP now, not to give
customers a reason to wait.

Note  that  a  hi-fidelity  MVP  doesn’t  just  magically  appear  in  this  step.
You don’t just stop at this step and write one. Instead, it’s the result of agile
development with continuous deployment and continuous product and feature
refinements that have been made since the company opened for business (one
of  the  many  reasons  you  can’t  do  Customer  Development  with  waterfall

engineering).  You  haven’t  gotten  this  far  unless  your  product  development
team has continually iterated, deployed, tested and improved the high fidelity
MVP since you left Phase 3 of customer discovery.

Now  if  not  earlier,  the  hi-fidelity  MVP  must  be  architected  for
instrumentation that delivers a stream of customer and product behavior data
used at the company every single day to further develop the business model
and  the  product.  Ensure  that  the  dials,  meters  and  gauges  are  working,  and
then hold onto your seat because we’re about to move those needles. Think of
instrumentation for a software application as gauges and instruments on the
business model canvas, providing information about what’s happening in the
application.

Get Ready to Sell: Build a Metrics Toolset

  Web/mobile  businesses  focus  on  data  collection,  analysis  and
optimization  from  the  day  they  go  live  till  the  day  the  doors  close.  A
web/mobile  startup’s  conversion  funnel  monitors  customers  through  their
entire life cycle. The entire process is driven by a never-ending campaign to
test,  measure,  and  optimize  every  step  in  the  funnel,  from  awareness  to
purchase. It’s a 24/7 process of “try it, measure it, tweak it.”

Web/mobile businesses focus on data collection,
analysis and optimization from the day they go live
til the day the doors close.

The products you build should be instrumented to measure every click
on  the  website  or  app,  its  source,  and  the  action  it  causes  or  doesn’t.  As  a
result,  the  management  team  should  have  at  its  fingertips  a  dashboard  that
summarizes  every  key,  actionable  user  behavior,  and  delivers  insights  and
trends  that  drive  continual  business  improvement.  There  are  two  parts  to
building a metrics tool set:

determining which key business metrics need to be measured

developing a dashboard or system to collect and monitor the data

Key Metrics to Measure

Long  before  the  web  was  born,  19th-century  retailer  John  Wanamaker  of

 
Philadelphia  summarized  the  challenge  that  online  and  mobile  marketers
would  face  nearly  two  centuries  later:  “I  know  I’m  wasting  half  of  my
advertising  budget.  I  only  wish  I  knew  which  half.”  In  the  web/mobile
channels,  this  process  is  far  easier  than  it  was  for  Wanamaker’s  newspaper
and  radio  ads,  because  every  click  and  consumer  action  can  be  recorded.
Determining what to measure is where the process begins.

Using  your  customer  relationships  hypotheses,  identify  the  metrics  for
success in the business model. Prioritize and limit the number of metrics to
fewer than a dozen, and the only metrics to be measured are those that can be
acted  on  or  improved.  Think:  “how  many,  how  fast,  how  much,  and  how
good?”

How  many  customers  are  acquired,  and  how  many  of  those  are
activated? (And how many are lost? And where in the purchase process
do you lose them?)

How fast do they arrive and how fast do they activate? After one page
view or visit, or 20 of either?

How much does each acquisition and activation cost?

How  good  are  the  customers  who  are  being  acquired?  Active  users/
spenders who return again and again or visitors with no “stickiness” at
all?

Metrics to Measure, in the “Get Customers” Funnel Web/Mobile
Channels (Figure 8.9)

For consistency’s sake, consider organizing the metrics the way the sales

funnel is organized—by acquisition and activation metrics. For example:

Acquisition metrics:

Total number of visits by visitor type, time of day, and source, and page
views per visit

Paid and referred traffic conversion rates by source (how many links or
banners, and at what cost, to generate one visitor or user) and cost per
acquired/activated user

Quantities and percentages of referred traffic by source

Unique  behaviors  or  actions  of  subsets  or  segments  of  the  customer
universe

I know I’m wasting half of my ad budget. I only
wish I knew which half...

Activation metrics

Total number of activations: another percentage of hourly/daily/weekly
acquisitions

Number/percentage of activations, tracked back to the original source

Number/percentage/cost  per  activation,  based  on  quality  (heavy  users
and  big  spenders  or  modest  spenders  and  inactive  users?),  wherever
identifiable, preferably by source

Number of visits, page views, referrals per activated user, by source and
by cost

Activation  metrics  also  capture  user  behavior  for  assessment  and
improvement. Typical behavior metrics include the number and percentage of
people  who  download  or  otherwise  activate,  register  or  engage  within  a
certain number of visits or page views.

Monitor people who take an activation action, like watching a demo, and
then  don’t  activate,  as  well  as  those  who  abandon  during  the  enrollment  or
registration  process.  Again,  the  list  is  endless,  so  be  careful  not  to  measure
more than the team can manage or improve on effectively.

This  list  is  the  tip  of  a  huge  iceberg.  Focus  on  the  ones  that  help  you

 
understand  customer  behavior  to  efficiently  drive  acquisition  and  activation
and ultimately drive revenue!

“Grow Customer” Referrals happen through “Viral loops.”
(Figure 8.10)

Referral Metrics

Referral  metrics  are  important  because  recommendations  from  existing
customers are the most cost-effective source of new customers. Key referral
metrics are:

number and percentage of users referred

average number of prospects existing customers

referral acceptance rate

Assess  referral  incentive  programs  to  determine  which  incentives

motivate the most new users to refer others and the cost per referral.

At this point in the customer validation process, it’s too early to worry
much  about  customer  retention  (discussed  in  depth  in  Phase  2),  since  the
company’s overwhelming early focus is on getting its first customers. When
designing the metrics system, make sure it can accommodate metrics that will
be  needed  later  to  monitor  retention  and  referral,  including  user  cohorts
described in detail in Phase 2.

Use a dashboard or system to collect and monitor
data

Your startup’s future lies in its customer acquisition, activation and retention
data.  This  is  so  important  that  many  web  businesses  actually  display  their
real-time site-performance data on a jumbo flat-screen monitor in the office
so that it’s always the center of attention. Off-the-shelf dashboard systems are
available, and home-grown solutions are readily built using tools as simple as
Excel.

Be careful not to overdo it with metrics. A small
number of metrics tell the overall “health” story of
the business.

Be  careful  not  to  overdo  it  with  metrics.  Generally,  a  relatively  small
number of metrics tell the overall “health” story of the business, so resist the
temptation  to  generate  complex,  overwhelming  collections  of  data  that  take

 
management  eyes  off  the  key  issues.  Those  issues  usually  revolve  around
“how  many,  how  much,  how  fast”:  how  many  customers  are  activated  (or
lost), at what cost, and how quickly. Good CEOs have these key statistics as
well as their improvement trends and key drivers at their fingertips and can
recite  them  almost  on  cue.  Equally  important,  they  can  be  measured  on  a
whiteboard or a simple spreadsheet.

The metrics you use to measure and monitor your business ought to be
the  same  ones  you  and  your  board  are  looking  at  during  board  meetings.  If
they’re only  asking  you  for  income  statement,  balance  sheet  and  cash  flow
and not looking at these numbers, you’ve failed as a CEO. It’s your job to get
your board to agree that the numbers you’re worrying about are the numbers
they’re worrying about.

Figure  8.11  shows  a  dashboard  for  a  simple  content  site  where  the
business  goals  are  increased  page  views,  customer  referrals,  and  e-mail
delivery.

Example of a Simple Dashboard (Figure 8.11)

In the next step, if your startup doesn’t already have one, you’ll recruit
and install a “data chief” to manage the data and its interpretation. He’ll also
quarterback  the  company’s  plan  to  use  that  data  to  drive  continuous
improvement  in  the  way  customers  discover,  engage  with,  and  use  the
product and how they help sell it to their friends and colleagues.

Get Ready to Sell: Hire a Data Analytics Chief

 In a startup that’s selling physical goods, it was the founders who first had
to  find  the  sales  roadmap  and  then  hired  a  sales  closer  to  assist  them.
Likewise, a web/mobile company needs a dedicated data analytics chief after
the  founders  have  discovered  the  key  customer  acquisition  and  activation
metrics. The analytics chief will drive “continuous improvement,” not just in
the customer validation process but in perpetuity.

The analytics chief will drive “continuous
improvement,” not just in the customer validation
process but in perpetuity.

At first, one of the founders may take on this role. (Extra credit if he’s
an  experienced  “data  junkie,”  statistical  analyst,  or  “quant”  who  loves  to
collect  and  pore  over  data,  looking  for  anomalies,  opportunities,  trends  and
weaknesses.)  Whether  the  person’s  called  the  chief  marketing  officer,  the
data  analytics  chief,  the  database  or  online  marketing  director,  or  just  plain
“founder” is irrelevant. Agility with numbers and tools are critical job skills,
as is innate curiosity. Also required: the “clout” to make things happen in the
company  once  the  data  shows  that  something  isn’t  happening  per  plan  and
requires a pivot. Responsibilities include:

online  optimization  of  targeted  campaigns,  managing  all  aspects  of
customer behavior reporting, tracking, analysis, and optimization

management  of  all  internal  research,  sponsorship,  lead  generation,  and

 
promotion programs

development  and  management  of  plans,  budgets  costs  and  results  of
marketing programs

management  of  budgets,  forecasts,  tracking  and  administration  of
program costs and results

assuring the data is available to all key team members

If  this  person  is  not  a  founder,  he  or  she  must  be  a  part  of  the  senior
management team, reporting to and updating it regularly. He or she should be
hired as early as possible, ideally in time to participate in development of the
dashboard  system  and  selection  of  the  metrics  it  will  track.  He  or  she  must
fully  understand  the  business  model  and  key  business  drivers,  as  he  or  she
will be a loud voice driving pivots and iterations. The person must be a good
collaborator, easy to work with, and highly creative—a rare combination.

This person must be a part of the senior
management team.

Agree on how often the CEO should be briefed. The management team?
The entire staff? Remember to focus the person on prioritizing and collecting
only  key,  actionable  data,  not  reams  of  useless  information.  Craft  both
compensation  and  confidentiality/no-compete  agreements  with  this  person,
who  will  know  more  about  the  company’s  business  drivers  than  virtually
anyone else. Losing this person prematurely can be a major setback.

Get Ready to Sell: Formalize the Advisory Board

Hopefully,  you’ve  asked  for  help  from  advisers  on  an  informal  basis  in
customer  discovery.  In  this  phase,  it’s  time  to  formally  engage  them.  There
are  no  hard  and  fast  rules  for  how  large  an  advisory  board  should  be  or
whether  it  should  be  a  “board”  at  all.  Basically,  you  want  two  things  from
advisors:  great  introductions  you  can’t  get  any  other  way  to  key  customers,
talent or investors; and bold, out-of-the-box business model design thinking
that  will  have  dramatic  impact  on  your  strategy.  All  the  rest  is  window
dressing.

Think  strategically,  not  tactically,  about  advisors’  reach  and  sphere  of
influence.  Recruit  only  advisors  who  will  make  a  serious  impact  on  the
company  in  one  way  or  another—think  quality,  not  quantity.  (If  you’re
raising  money  having  a  cloud  of  “impressive  names”  may  help,  but  don’t
confuse  them  with  these  people.)  Formal  advisory  board  meetings  aren’t
required,  at  least  for  now,  but  this  process  should  deliver  access  to  experts
who can help.

Begin  by  assembling  an  advisory  board  road  map,  much  like  the
collateral roadmap developed earlier. As shown in Table 8.3, the roadmap is
an  organized  list  of  the  key  advisors  needed.  (Don’t  feel  compelled  to  put
advisors in every box on the chart.)

In  this  example,  the  roadmap  differentiates  how  each  advisor  will  be
used (technical, business, customer, industry or marketing). Usually, the most
important  advisors  your  startup  can  have  are  the  ones  with  “golden
rolodexes”  who  can  make  high-level  introductions  to  early  customers,
channel partners, or partners who can deliver significant web traffic. Product
Development  may  need  technical  advisors  as  early  as  Phase  1  of  customer
discovery.  The  technical  advisory  board  is  staffed  with  advisors  from

academia or industry who can offer technical advice and pointers to technical
talent.  As  the  company  begins  to  sell  product,  these  advisors  are  used  as
technical references for customers.

Where  possible,  particularly  in  enterprise  sales  situations,  put  key
potential customers on the customer advisory board. These are people met in
customer  discovery  who  can  advise  about  the  product  from  the  customer’s
perspective. I always tell these advisors, “I want you on my advisory board so
I can learn how to build a product you’ll buy. We both fail if I can’t.” They’ll
serve as a customer conscience for the product, and later some will be great
references  for,  or  introducers  to,  other  customers.  Use  them  for  insight  and
the  company’s  business  and  Customer
one-on-one  meetings  with 
them  for  specific
Development  staff—and  don’t  be  afraid 
introductions.

to  ask 

Advisory Board Roles (Table 8.3)

Two  other  sets  of  advisors  to  consider:  an  industry  advisory  board  of
domain  experts  who  bring  credibility  to  the  company’s  specific  market  or
technology; and an advisor to the CEO who’s a “been there, done that” CEO
type who can bring practical, how-to advice.

Make sure that, for people that count to you, you
count to them.

The  number  of  advisors  for  each  domain  will  obviously  vary  with
circumstances, but there are some rules of thumb. Both sales and marketing
advisors tend to have large egos. You can usually only manage only one of
them at a time. Industry advisors like to think of themselves as the pundits for
particular industries. Have them give you their opinions without being in the
same room or showing up on the same day—this allows you to sort through
whose advice you want to follow. Business advisors are much like marketing
advisors,  but  some  have  expertise  in  different  stages  of  the  company.
Consider  keeping  a  few  on  hand  to  make  you  smarter.  Finally,  our  product
development team could never get enough of the technical advisors. They’d
come in and make us smarter about specific technical issues. The same was
true  for  the  customer  advisors.  Be  sure  to  learn  something  new  every  time
they come by.

Compensating Advisors

The  Oracle  of  Omaha,  Warren  Buffet,  says  it  best:  “Make  sure  that,  for
people that count to you, you count to them.” That about sums it up. Advisers
typically  receive  common  stock  without  precise  correlation  to  the  hours
they’ll  give  your  company  or  exactly  what  they’ll  do  to  help.  The  stock
typically vests over time, in monthly increments, so it’s easily adjusted based
on the adviser’s value to the company.

The best advisors of all pay you to become advisors.
They often make a modest cash investment.

 
The best advisors of all pay you to become advisors. They often make a
modest  cash  investment  of,  say,  $20,000  or  $100,000  for  some  of  the
company’s preferred stock, and their investment is “boosted” with a generous
allocation of common shares that pay for the advisory services. Sophisticated
investors recognize the importance of advisors’ willingness to not only lend
their names but also invest some personal cash in what they clearly believe is
a significant opportunity.

Customer Validation, Phase Two: Get Out
of the Building and Sell!

IN  THIS  PHASE  OF  CUSTOMER  VALIDATION,  it’s  time  to  try  to  sell.  Customer
discovery  had  you  get  out  of  the  building  twice,  first  to  understand
customers’ problems and how they work and second to determine how well
the new product solves that problem. And while you’ve no doubt conducted
hundreds of tests to iterate and pivot your business model, there is no better
“pass/fail”  test  than  asking  a  customer  to  give  you  an  order  or  spend  time
with your app or website.

In a physical channel, nothing validates a hypothesis better than a signed
order,  especially  when  it’s  signed  before  the  product  is  either  complete  or
actually  shipping.  In  the  web/mobile  channel,  the  equivalent  validation  is
attracting  users  or  payers  at  the  rate  your  hypotheses  said  you  would.  (In  a
multi-sided  market,  even  if  you’re  getting  great  traffic  and  growth,  be  sure
the “other” side, usually the advertisers or payers, are eager to spend to reach
your traffic.)

Your job in this phase is not to scale a revenue plan but to validate your
business  model  hypotheses  with  pass/fail  tests  that  feel  an  awful  lot  like
selling  or  building  web  traffic.  But  revenue  or  traffic  at  full  scale  doesn’t
happen until the next step, customer creation. Customer validation is the test
sales  process  that—while  it  makes  real  sales—is  principally  aimed  at
answering a long list of questions, including:

Are customers enthusiastic about the product’s value proposition?

Does the company understand its customer segments and their needs?

Do  customers  truly  value  the  product  features?  Are  any  key  features
missing?

Is the product pricing right, and can the product be sold at a reasonable

cost?

What’s  the  purchasing  and  approval  process  inside  a  customer’s
company?

Are  the  sales  roadmap  and  channel  strategy  valid  for  scaling  the  sales
team?

Are there enough customers to make this a real business?

“Get out of the building” means one thing for companies with physical
goods or those primarily using the physical channel, and it means something
radically  different  for  companies  in  the  web/mobile  channels.  Figure  9.1
shows the differences.

In customer validation, the testing process is a series of elegantly simple
pass/fail tests where the answer is binary, and never “it feels good” or “they
like it.” Some examples:

If your physical channel business model says...

you will close two sales for every 10 sales calls, do you?

an average customer will buy six widgets in three months, do they?

$5,000 at spent at a tradeshow (or in direct mail) will generate 25 leads,
does it?

2/3  of  the  prospects  you  pitch  will  refer  you  to  three  friends  each,  do
they?

If your web/mobile channel business model says...

two of five acquired users will activate, do they?

four  in  10  activators  will  pass  your  free  trial  offer  to  five  friends,  do
they?

$100  spent  on  AdWords  will  generate  50  clicks  to  your  site,  does  it
happen?

one in four advertisers in your multi-sided market will sit still for your
advertising  sales  pitch  (even  though  they  probably  won’t  buy  till  you
have lots more traffic), do they?

Here are the next steps you’ll undertake, by channel:

Steps for “Get Out of the Building and Sell” by Channel (Figure 9.1)

Get Out of the Building: Prepare Optimization
Plans/Tools

 The job of optimization is to squeeze more out of each of the “get, keep
and  grow”  steps.  Squeeze  more  of  what,  you  ask?  More  of  everything.  For
example:

If 6 percent of visitors activate at launch, try to increase it to 10 percent
or more

When visitors abandon after two page views, can navigation increase it
to three?

If 5 percent of visitors post a comment, how can you encourage more to
do so?

If  the  average  cost  per  activated  user  is  $1,  how  can  you  lower  it  to
$0.75 or $0.80?

Can you improve e-mail open rates from 22 percent to 30 percent?

Getting more is what optimization is all about, and you’ll do it from this
moment until the moment you’re selling off your furniture or ringing the bell
at NASDAQ. This and the next two web/mobile sections provide a primer on
optimization, the subject of many full-length texts. In this section, you will:

Get a basic primer on optimization strategy

Take  a  look  at  how  optimization  goes  to  work  at  a  hypothetical  web
startup

and learn about the key optimization tools and how they work

The  next  optimize  “Get”  web/mobile  section  will  take  what  you  learn
from this section and show you how to put your “new” tools to work. And the
third section will do the same for “keep” and “grow” customers activities.

The “Get Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 9.2)

Before you start

Before  you  start  optimizing  your  site/app,  just  as  a  reminder  that  the
following building blocks must be in place:

1.  A hi-fidelity MVP. It must be live and the product should look “finished”

(even  if  the  MVP  isn’t  fully  featured).  This  ensures  clear  product
feedback  and  the  most  accurate  measurement  of  “get  customers”
program results.

2.  The Acquire plan and tools. E-mails, AdWords, banners, pr efforts, viral
programs  and  other  tools  that  will  drive  consumers  to  engage  with  the
product.

3.  The Activate plan and tools. Home and landing pages encourage people
to  buy,  engage,  or  activate,  supported  with  activation  tools  such  as
follow-up e-mails, calls, or viral and promotion programs for those who
don’t buy or engage at once.

4.  A dashboard to monitor customers’ behavior. It should be working and
the product should be instrumented to deliver real-time data on results of
acquisition and activation programs.

Customer Optimization Strategy

Optimization efforts should focus on:

Volume: Acquire as many visitors as possible and drive to them to the
product

Cost: Steadily improve the cost per activated customer

Conversion:  Increase  the  number  of  visitors  who  activate  and  become
customers or users

The first question to address is “What do I optimize?” Different types of

web business optimize for entirely different things.

The first question to address is, “What do I
optimize?”

Here’s how three types of web/mobile business should be thinking about their
“Get” customers optimization:

E-commerce sites should start by optimizing traffic and initial orders, of

 
course, and then move on to focus on average order size, repeat orders,
and customer referrals

Multi-sided  markets  (usually  ad-supported)  should  focus  first  on  total
traffic,  then  on  members  or  subscribers,  DAU  (daily  active  users),
minutes  of  engagement,  repeat  visits,  and  referrals.  They  should  then
move  to  the  “other  side”  to  maximize  ad  revenue,  CPM,  and  sales
pipeline

Marketplaces  should  focus  on  everything  an  e-commerce  site  would
optimize  as  well  as  the  number  of  vendors,  seller  acquisition  and
retention  and  liquidity  (how  many  of  the  items  for  sale  actually  get
sold).  Then  they  should  try  to  optimize  daily  transactions  and  average
transaction size

More Keys to Successful Optimization Strategy:

Know  exactly  why  you’re  testing,  as  in  “to  see  if  we  can  improve
registrations” or “to see if free shipping materially increases orders.”

Don’t test everything, test the important things.

Don’t  overtest.  This  is  a  major  mistake  made  by  many  web  startups
because  testing  is  just  so  easy  online.  Don’t  test  everything,  test  the
important things. Don’t test more than two changes to a page at a time,
to  avoid  confusing  your  visitors  so  you  can  tell  which  change  drove
which  improvement.  When  a  test  “succeeds,”  be  sure  you  know  what
made the difference

Run controlled tests to guarantee randomness and validity. A strict A/B
test, the most common controlled test, shows every other visitor version
“A”  or  version  “B”  of  a  page  or  an  offer.  It  rigorously  controls  the
variables.  It  doesn’t  show  “A”  on  Monday  and  “B”  on  Tuesday,  since
there’s no way to determine what else might have influenced customer
behavior  in  the  test,  which  could  be  almost  anything:  a  sale  at  a
competitive  site,  a  change  in  the  weather,  or  even  the  time  of  day
(people mostly surf at work during lunchtime)

 
Always  keep  lifetime  value  in  mind.  The  cost  of  getting  a  customer  is
nowhere near as important as the revenue that customer brings you over
time, and the lifetime value math for “get customers” is pretty simple:

LTV=>CAQ

LTV or Lifetime value (the total amount of money you’ll make from this
customer) must be more than the CAQ or customer acquisition cost (costs to
acquire and activate the customer).

Too  many  companies  go  out  of  business  telling  themselves,  “This
customer will be worth ‘X’ over five years,” forgetting the second part: “only
if  we’re  still  here  and  they’re  still  with  us.”  Use  a  reasonable,  not-too-long
lifetime value. For example, how many months of subscription revenue will it
take to repay my “get customers” cost?

In summary: The optimization plan will change often, perhaps as often
as  every  day.  Start  by  defining  the  specific  acquisition  metrics  to  optimize.
Don’t tackle too many at once, and always know what your goal is when you
begin the experiment. As you’re running your tests, create alternatives for the
tactics that don’t perform well after optimization.

Optimization is a never-ending data-driven process
of “test, measure, tweak.”

Optimization  is  a  never-ending  data-driven  process  of  “test,  measure,
tweak” that stops only when the company closes its doors. Founders should
be intimately involved with, if not leading, the process, since it’s vital to your
company’s efficiency, scalability, and future.

A Lesson in Optimization Tactics

Let’s look at how optimization works in real time in a hypothetical company
selling the first in a series of downloadable $39.95 software apps for home-
based businesspeople. The CEO has focused her team on two key metrics at
the widest part of the funnel: the total cost of activating a customer (including
the  cost  of  acquiring  him  or  her),  and  the  ultimate  value  of  each  activated
customer  individually.  Let’s  follow  along,  starting  with  a  look  at  the  data

 
chief’s  first  analysis  of  acquisition  and  activation  programs.  Here’s  how  it
looks in chart form:

Example of Optimization Tactics Chart (Table 9.1)

Walking through the example one line at a time provides a wealth of insights
into the optimization process itself.

          •      Acquisition  delivered  200  “lookers”  at  an  average  cost  of  $5  per
customer  click,  or  $1,000  (clicks  can  cost  as  little  as  pennies  or  as
much as $50 or more, depending on demand for the AdWords). If we
could  reduce  the  cost  per  looker  by  20  percent  we  would  deliver  25
percent more prospects to the company without increasing the budget
   Acquisition Improvements to test: Stop using the most expensive
AdWords.  Try  alternative  sources  of  traffic  beyond  Google.
Explore  alternative  programs  like  banners  and  textlinks.  Reduce
daily  AdWords  budgets  or  hours  or  geography  (eliminate
overnight hours, Europe, or weekends for example). Increase viral
marketing at low cost

     •   Activation 40 people (20 percent of the 200 who clicked to the site)
activated  –  meaning  they  took  a  demo  or  provided  their  contact
information. Therefore the cost of each activation was $25 (or $1,000
spent  divided  by  40  people).  Yet  at  this  point  no  one  has  bought
anything
   Activation Improvements to test: Intensify or enlarge calls to action
or  graphics.  Improve  or  increase  activation  incentives.  Change
price  or  introductory  offer.  Reorganize  the  way  features/benefits
are prioritized and explained. Consider a free trial

     •   Purchase – half the activated customers buy an application for $39.95.
In  this  example  that’s  20  people,  each  spending  $40,  for  a  total  of

          
          
$800  in  sales.  These  customers,  while  apparently  profitable  (on  a
gross profit basis), are “losers” because it cost $25 to get someone to
spend  $40—63  percent  of  the  sale—which  can’t  be  viable  for  most
businesses,  as  it  leaves  very  little  to  cover  product,  staff,  overhead
and, profit. But, if the funnel delivered just five more customers, the
same $1,000 investment would deliver $200 more in sales.

     •   Purchase Improvements to test

   Deploy activation improvements, but also research non-buyers to

understand why they’re non-buyers

   Add a demo
   Add “click to call” contact option
   Conduct A/B tests of price and offer
   Consider follow-up e-mail or phone calls to close

Now  take  a  last  look  at  Table  9.1.  Imagine  that  in  addition  to  the  20
buyers of our $39.95 software package, the company acquires 10 additional
Valued  Customers.  Instead  of  just  buying  one  software  product,  these
customers buy on average 2.5 software packages, spending $100 each to do
so. That generates $1,000 in revenue from valued customers. Over time, these
Valued  Customers  are  probably  worth  even  more,  since  they  may  also
generate referrals to others and buy more packages themselves later.

In  all,  this  test  would  be  labeled  at  best  a  modest  victory  for  some
(where  the  cost  of  goods  is  very  low,  as  it  is  for  software  downloads).
Generating  $1,800  in  revenue  as  well  as  future  prospects—activators  who
never  bought—with  $1,000  on  marketing  spending  reflects  a  software
company with a promising future, assuming it can further optimize its funnel
for the long term.) Clearly, improvements at every step of the funnel process
can deliver big incremental revenue and profit improvements.

Apply this kind of thinking and detailed analysis to every key program
outlined  in  your  “get”  plan.  Test  a  program,  measure  the  results,  and
brainstorm ways to improve the results. Change some aspect of the program
(the  offer,  the  graphics,  the  messaging,  as  outlined  in  your  plan)  and  test  it
and measure it again. Once it’s measured, assess the results, develop the next
improvement idea, and test it again... and again... and again. As we said at the
outset,  this  is  the  lifeblood  of  web/mobile  startups,  and  the  process  truly
never ends.

          
          
          
          
          
Optimization Tools:

Like  any  good  craftsperson,  good  tools  are  essential  to  doing  a  good  job.
Here  is  an  overview  of  the  key  tools  used  most  often  by  web  and  mobile
marketers. In the next two web/mobile sections, we’ll talk to you about where
and how to use each one. In most cases, they’re used in each of the three get,
keep  and  grow  optimizations,  since  most  (but  not  all)  customer  interaction
happens online.

Sample A/B Tests Compare Changing Home Page Results (Figure 9.3)

A/B Testing

A/B  testing  is  the  most  widely  used  way  to  optimize  web  and  mobile  “get,
keep and grow” activities. It can also be used to optimize web/mobile product
performance (the subject of a different book). A/B testing compares one web
page version with another to see which produces the best results. It’s the most
used method for testing key landing-page elements. Did a big blue button get
more activations than a small line of text? Which headline, picture, or product
offer generated more sign-ups, sales or abandons?

Activation mantra: The more we test, the better we
do.

Identify the key elements of your landing page that drive activation, and
test  them  carefully,  fairly,  and  sequentially.  Think  of  the  process  as  “try  it,
measure it, tweak it.” The activation mantra: The more we test, the better we
do. Remember to maintain a clear control group: change the presentation to
half  the  audience,  ideally  alternating  from  one  visitor  to  the  next  (in  A/B,
every second visitor sees “b”). Many testers drive 80% of the traffic to one
alternative, and 20% to the other, which can test on high-traffic pages well.

Usability Tests

Usability  testing  checks  whether  the  users  of  the  site/app/product  use  it  the
way you intended them to. It can be as informal as inviting consumers into
the  conference  room  and  watching  them  spend  time  on  the  website  or  as
comprehensive as a formal focus-group testing. It can identify weaknesses in
the  site’s  explanation  of  the  product,  its  benefits,  and  the  reasons  to  buy.  It
can  trace  users’  behavior  on  the  site  to  determine  ways  to  optimize  the
conversion  rates,  enhance  online  product  demonstrations,  or  find  confusing
copy, diagrams, or navigation. Inexpensive tools and expensive services can
both help with the testing.

 
Usability Tests happen in Starbucks or test facilities (Figure 9.4)

Invite your target customers to the office and watch as they engage with
the site or app (and use any of the online services like Userfy or Usertesting
that  do  low-cost  user  testing).  Watch  these  customers  explore  uninterrupted
while watching over their shoulder. Make notes about where they went and
where  they  didn’t,  and  follow  up  to  learn  why  they  did  what  they  did.
Obviously,  as  you  learn  about  confusing  or  suboptimal  locations  or
navigation  on  the  site,  test  and  measure  alternatives  until  the  problem  goes
away.  Consider  conducting  user  testing  with  a  laptop  at  Starbucks,  where
random customers get coffee or a gift card for spending 10 minutes with you,

exploring and discussing the new product, app or site.

Heat Maps

Heat  maps  use  eye  tracking  to  show  where  most  people  look  or  click  on  a
website  or  page.  Software  tracks  a  user’s  gaze  and  translates  them  into
regions  colored  yellow,  orange  and  red.  The  richer  the  color,  the  more
eyeballs are focused on the button, headline or graphic.

Example of Heat Mapping (Figure 9.5)

If  too  many  customers  are  drawn  to  the  “demo”  button  instead  of  the
“try now” button, perhaps the sizes or locations or both should be changed.
The heat map indicates high-traffic spots on a page, where the most important
product features or offers should be located. Heat maps may even show that
visitors are clicking on graphics or copy that aren’t linked to anything.

Eye Tracking

Eye tracking uses heat-map technology in a different way. When people visit
a website, what do they look at first, second, or third?

Example of Eye Tracking (Figure 9.6)

The “Z” pattern is considered the most common way Americans read a
web  page,  starting  across  the  top,  from  left  to  right,  and  then  skimming
diagonally downward across the page. Eyes move at astounding speeds, and
users are known to spend as little as a few seconds scanning a page to find
something  of  interest.  It  pays  to  put  key  content  and  invitations  for  user
interaction in the places where the users tend to go. (Keep in mind that web
pages in other languages may scan differently.)

Copy Testing

While  copy  isn’t  a  tool  the  way  a  heat  map  or  an  A/B  test  might  be,  using
those and other tools to test copy makes the “copy buffer” a very important
tool. It’s almost axiomatic that no headline is ever the best possible headline,
and there’s always a way to improve “sell” copy, offer copy, and the way you
get  people  excited  about  your  product,  its  features,  and  the  reasons  they
should buy. Copy testing can happen on the site, in focus groups, or through
web  surveys.  Bigger  sites  create  alternate  mirror  sites  to  A/B-test  different
copy versions. This is a powerful optimization tool.

Visitors focus on headlines, highlighted words and
bulleted lists but scan the text.

No  matter  how  polished  the  prose  or  how  many  people  edit  the  copy,
few  visitors  read  all  or  even  many  of  the  words.  Tests  by  industry  expert
Jakob  Nielsen  suggest  that  most  visitors  focus  on  headlines,  highlighted
words  and  bulleted  lists  but  scan  the  text.  He  notes  that  the  three  most
effective design elements are plain text, faces, and cleavage and other body
parts.

In the next web/mobile section, you’ll strap on your e-toolbelt and go to

work, optimizing your “get” customers activities.

Get Out of the Building: Optimize Getting More
Customers

 In the prior phase, you got basic lessons in web and mobile performance
optimization,  had  some  basic  training  in  how  optimization  works,  and
reviewed  the  tools  and  techniques  you’ll  use  to  create  your  optimization
strategy. This phase takes that learning and puts it to work at the widest part
of  the  “get  customers”  funnel—where  customers  come  from—the  acquire
and activate steps of “get, keep and grow.”

The “Get Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 9.7)

For  some  websites  98  percent  of  people  who  visit  (“acquired”)  never
ever return. That means only two percent of acquired prospects have a chance
of  becoming  a  customer  or  user,  even  after  you’ve  spent  many  millions
acquiring  them.  If  that  statistic  doesn’t  call  attention  to  the  need  for
optimizing activation efforts, nothing will!

98 percent of people who visit never ever return...

How will Your Startup Optimize its “Get
Customers” Efforts?

Optimization objectives vary by your business model. For example:

Subscription products (e.g., software as a service) try to get customers to
explore, try, or use the product any way they’ll agree to do so, often with
freemium or low-cost trials

Expensive products and services strive to ensure that customers will be
driven to, and continue to engage with, the appropriate sales channel

Inexpensive  apps  and  games  often  try  to  sell  as  soon  as  they  engage
customers

Social networks will encourage first-timers to engage with the network,
participating  at  least  a  few  times  to  get  “hooked,”  and  then  to  invite
friends

Multi-sided market  businesses  try  to  attract  users  who  will  use  the  site
frequently, stay a long time, and bring their friends

Marketplaces (think Etsy or eBay) encourage sellers to join, list multiple
items, and enjoy early success on the site

PROCEED WITH CAUTION: Remember, this is an overview and a
tutorial. There’s no way to implement or even process this in one sitting.

How to Run the “Get” Optimization Process

 
 
 
Review the results of the “get” programs you’ve done to date, always asking
your data and team, which program:

1.  is most important to us? Start with the free “get” programs for because if
they’re  working  they  are  the  easiest  to  scale  up.  Accelerate  the  most
productive  program.  If  you’re  getting  tons  of  customers  from  SEO  or
bloggers, for example, start here to optimize that effort.

2.  is  the  most  disappointing?  When  you  launched  your  “get”  programs,
you  had  great  expectations  for  certain  programs,  whether  it  was  an
AdWords campaign, referrals to friends, natural search or a blimp flying
over your city. Design pass/fail tests to improve the results.

3.  gives you the best customers? If, for example, an e-mail campaign gets
you customers who buy faster, spend more, or visit more often and stay
longer, you obviously want more of those folks. So prioritize the plan to
optimize that program.

4.  gives you early customers with high lifetime value (LTV)? Get and seek
more  that  look  like  them.  Identify  high-LTV  behavior  (frequent  visits,
purchasing, posting or referrals, for example) in specific customers and
track back to their source, demography, or other common traits. Then go
find  more  customers  like  them.  This  is  hardest  in  the  company’s  early
days, when few customers exist and there’s less time to observe them.

Test a wide range of offers, incentives, deals and
discounts.

Finally,  test  a  wide  range  of  offers,  incentives,  deals  and  discounts.  While
alternatives are almost as obvious as they are endless, here are a few to try:
Offer a gift with purchase instead of a discount. Consider a time limit on the
offer,  as  in  “until  midnight  only”  or  “this  week’s  special.”  Create  limited
offers, as in “for the first 500 to sign up.”

Always  review  the  top  10  or  12  performance  metrics  daily,  led  by  the
data chief recruited earlier. That’s a dozen metrics, not dozens—on the “get
customers” program results. Prepare to be disappointed often, but the review
—good  or  bad—always  ends  with  the  same  question:  “how  do  we  improve
it?”

 
For less experienced web marketers

If  you’re  not  an  experienced  web/mobile  marketer,  and  don’t  know  an
important program from a disappointing one, try this approach instead. First,
focus on increasing the number of activations, since activations matter most.
(If you’ve acquired only a handful or a few dozen visitors, start talking about
possible pivots instead.)

Find  the  largest  single  source  of  customers  and  figure  out  how  to
increase the volume. How does more spending, improved creative, different
offers or greater frequency improve the result? Test each one, one at a time,
and often more than once per test.

Remember,  don’t  optimize  too  many  programs  at  once,  or  the  results
will  be  confusing—you  won’t  be  able  to  tell  what  worked  and  what  didn’t.
Recognize “getting customers” means that the acquire and activate programs
work hand in hand. You need both parts to work to truly “get” a customer...
not just someone who comes to your site or app, but who buys and engages.

Common Optimization Opportunities and Problems

If this book were to list every possible way to optimize getting customers, it
would be impossible to carry. The balance of this section addresses the most
common problems where optimization can help—getting more clicks to your
site  and  more  out  of  every  click.  Since  we  hear  these  questions  from
entrepreneurs so often, we’ve organized the approaches to optimization based
on the questions we hear most.

Problem: I have a website but nobody visits...

Other than perhaps CIA.gov, we don’t think there’s been a web business yet
that  didn’t  want  more  people  exposed  to  its  product  or  service,  or  more
visitors  to  its  home  page.  Visitors  are  clearly  the  lifeblood  of  every
web/mobile business.

Diagnosis: You are perilously close to extinction. There are tens of millions
of websites, and just “being there” doesn’t drive traffic as a rule.

You are perilously close to extinction. Use every tool

we have described in the prior pages.

Solution:

1.  Return  to  the  start  of  “Get Customers”  web/mobile.  Read  it  again  and

get to work.

2.  Find  more  e-mails,  Tweet  more  people,  beg  friends  to  invite  their

friends, create a funny YouTube and try to viralize it.

3.  Consider  changing  the  URL  to  something  people  will  find  more
naturally  (your  site’s  promise,  like  “instantlove.com”  rather  than
“socialdatinginc.com, for example).

4.  Pay  the  smartest  people  you  can  find  to  optimize  your  site  for  natural

search in a hurry.

5.  Do something crazy.... big events, promotions, hand out flyers on street

corners, scream, set your hair on fire, but do it fast!

Tools to use: Use every tool we have described in the prior pages, then
go online and find dozens more. Start at www.steveblank.com for a thorough
updated list.

Problem: Visitors come to my site or app, but don’t stay...

This common problem presents many optimization opportunities.

Diagnosis:  The  most  likely  problem:  something  isn’t  “clicking”  with  your
value proposition and product positioning, so start testing alternate versions.
Then  look  at  the  acquisition  tactics  you’re  using  and  rank  them  based  on
productivity (the most acquisitions with the least money or effort). Start with
the worst performing tactics and test alternatives.

Solution:

1.  Start by changing your messaging, whether you’re using e-mail, banner

ads, or banners pulled by WWII biplanes.

2.  If it’s AdWords, for example, pause all programs and start over. Spend

 
more per click, change the geography or hours your keywords are active
and  for  sure  experiment  by  buying  different  AdWords  and  testing
alternate ad copy.

3.  Test alternative calls to action. Offer something for free, whether it’s a
trial or a prize for visiting the site. And keep running this optimization
process forever.

4.  Change  the  offer.  If  you’re  offering  annual  signups,  test  monthly  or
“first  30  days  free.”  Develop  other  reasons  why  people  should  come
visit your site.

5.  Interview  lots  of  customers  face-to-face.  Find  out  what  they  like  and,

more important, what they don’t.

6.  Be sure you have multiple calls to action on the home page (like “take a

tour,” “try now for free,” “learn more” and “get more info”).

Tools to Use: Copy testing, A/B testing, and another look at your value
features  you’re

(unique  selling  proposition, 

proposition  messaging 
promoting, introductory offer, to name a few).

Problem: People Visit the Site, but don’t Click (no Activation)...

Diagnosis: This deadly problem is often masked by “vanity metrics,” where
the team high-fives and celebrates because unique visitors and page views are
increasing every day. So what!! If people come to the site or app and don’t
engage, try it, do something, sign up or pay up, your business is simply dead.
Period.

If we just described your site, ring the alarm bell and if your “data chief”
and marketing person aren’t sure what to do or test, it may be time to call in
(preferably  smart  freelance)  consultants,  buy  the  tons  of  other  books  on
optimization,  and  call  home  and  tell’em  you  won’t  be  home  for  a  while...
your business is at serious risk of implosion.

Solution: Pull out all the stops, remembering not to test too many things all at
once.  Start  by  talking  to  customers  who’ve  been  acquired  but  not  activated
(hopefully you have some of their e-mails, but call or ask them to call you—
don’t just e-mail) and find out what was uninteresting or unappealing to them
(that’s why it’s called Customer Development).

Then start to implement some optimization tactics.

1.  Find the page where most users abandon ship. Start testing stronger calls

to action and improved navigation on this page fast

2.  Test a variety of calls to action... click here to do this, sign up and get a

free...

3.  Do some heat mapping studies to see what people are looking at on the

page, and move calls to action closer to where their eyeballs go

4.  Test  bigger,  smaller,  or  different  calls  to  action:  louder  copy,  bigger
buttons, maybe a blinking or brightly-colored “try now,” for example

5.  Be  sure  your  “no  spam”  guarantee/promise  is  visible  in  every

communication

6.  Conduct  usability  testing  where  you  watch  actual  customers  as  they
review your home page. What questions do they ask, what do they click
on, do they get confused? Then ask them flat-out: “what don’t you like
about my site, product, or offer?”

7.  Buttons: Do more people click on a big ugly button or a small pink one?

Do they like round or square, a midpage location or lower left?

8.  “Sell”  and  body  copy:  constantly  test  new  copy  versions  to  see  which

gets more response

9.  Graphics:  Test  alternative  product  pictures, 

illustrations,  how-to

graphics and other elements to see better activations

Tools  to  Use:  Every  tool  in  the  toolbox  works  overtime  on  this  crisis.
A/B  test  everything.  Spend  money  on  usability  testing  and  one-on-one
customer interviews. Use heat maps, magic tricks, anything you can find, as
your business is clearly threatened with extinction right now.

Problem: We’re Getting Some Customers, but they don’t refer others...

Diagnosis: While this is certainly a “get” customers problem, we consider it a
“grow” problem and address it in the next section. After all, to be technical,
first you have to acquire and activate a customer to “grow” him or her. There
are  two  ways  to  “grow”  a  customer:  get  them  to  spend  more,  or  to  refer

others. Both are addressed in the next web/mobile section.

Problem: People are engaging, but not doing what you want...

Diagnosis:  You’re  getting  good  traffic,  and  people  are  clicking  or  at  least
viewing multiple pages. But nobody’s signing up, posting comments, playing
the  game,  adding  pictures,  spending  money,  or  doing  whatever  you  want
them to do.

Solution: Once again, you need to put almost the entire optimization toolbox
to work.

1.  Start  with  heat  maps  and  eye  tracking  to  see  what  people  are  actually

doing when they’re on the site

2.  Start A/B testing by first testing your calls to action. Make the graphics
different  or  bigger;  consider  adding  demos  or  animation;  Simplify  the
messaging to make it clearer, and A/B test it both onsite and in person

3.  Develop more “pathways” through the site—make the navigation bigger
and test providing at least a few more options (“read more,” “free trial,”
and so forth)

4.  Can  users  easily  sign  up,  post  a  comment,  upload  a  picture,  or  buy

something on the site? If not, fix it.

5.  Do users make lots of errors downloading the app, a pdf or a picture? If
so,  improve  the  process  by  rewriting  the  copy,  adding  graphics,
shortening the instructions or adding a video.

6.  Does  anybody  remember  your  headline  or  “sell  points”  five  minutes

after visiting? If not, test alternatives

7.  Be sure your company’s positioning and promise, plus endorsements or

happy user quotes are prominent on the site to give users comfort

Tools  to  use:  Use  the  entire  toolbox:  heat  maps,  eye  tracking,  A/B
testing, customer interviews, usability testing and a magic wand will all help.

 The common wisdom is that it cost 10 times more to get a new customer
than to keep and grow an existing one. Now that your company has users or
customers, this step optimizes how you “keep” and “grow” them. In the first
“optimize”  phase,  you  chose  a  set  of  optimization  tools  and  a  plan  for
deploying  them  to  improve  the  results  of  your  “keep”  and  “grow”  efforts.
Now it’s time to put those plans into action. Believe us, this process is never-
ending.

The “Keep Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 9.8)

PROCEED WITH CAUTION: Remember, this is an overview and a
tutorial. There’s no way to implement or even process this in one sitting.

 
 
Optimizing “Keep” (or Customer Retention)
Programs

in 

the  customer-relationship  hypotheses: 

Launch  at  least  some  basic  customer  retention  and  growth  programs,  you
loyalty  programs,
developed 
customer  check-in  calls,  customer-satisfaction  surveys,  product  updates  and
upgrades,  and  close  monitoring  of  customer  complaints.  Where  possible
(recognizing that it’s early and there aren’t many customers yet), monitor the
costs  and  return  on  investment  for  the  programs  individually  to  be  sure
they’re incrementally profitable. Do customers in the “points” program spend
more and stay longer, for example?

Remember  that  customer  retention,  or  “keep”  customers,  begins  with
great products and customer service. Your customer-relationships hypothesis
should include a plan for testing at least a few of these programs now, during
customer validation.

Here  are  some  things  to  watch  for  in  the  most  common  customer  retention
programs, and ways to optimize the program results:

User  outreach  programs:  What  do  customers  say  when  you  e-mail,
Tweet, or call them about their use of and satisfaction with the product?
Do  they  even  take  your  calls  or  answer  your  e-mails?  If  not,  consider
calling  instead  of  e-mailing,  or  testing  more  urgent/ambitious  subject
lines on your e-mails

If  customers  are  responding  in  small  numbers,  add  an  incentive  to
stimulate response, such as “Tell us your opinion and get a free month’s
service  just  for  speaking  up.”  When  you  get  negative  feedback,  first
respond, and then tell all your customers, not just the complainers, that
you’ve listened and made the improvements your customers suggested

Loyalty  programs:  First,  are  customers  participating  in  the  loyalty
program?  If  not,  are  you  marketing  it  ambitiously  enough?  A/B-test
some special sign-up offers, like “5,000 bonus points just for joining to
get you started.” If you’re getting sign-ups, the next question is whether
the  program  creates  incentive  for  the  behavior  you  want,  whether  it’s
more  active  site  use  or  more  frequent  purchasing.  A/B-test  different

messages,  incentives,  and  promotions  to  get  the  most  out  of  your
loyalty-program participants

Contests and events: These can only help retention if people participate,
so  A/B-test,  copy-test,  and  constantly  refresh  promotional  campaigns
both on the site and through e-mail to users. Do your changes get more
people  to  participate?  If  not,  keep  testing.  Over  time  (at  least  three
weeks, maybe longer), monitor whether the use of these promotions and
contests  is  driving  the  behavior  you  want,  be  it  more  clicks,  uploads,
downloads, or purchases. Keep A/B-testing new options forever!

Information feeds: Whether you’re using a blog, an RSS feed, e-mail or
to  keep  your  customers  updated  on  product
smoke  signals 
enhancements, how-to tips, or other helpful information, they’re of little
help if nobody reads them. A/B-test a variety of ways of delivering the
same  message,  using  different  headlines  and  headline  sizes,  videos,
cartoons, or diagrams. Consider making offers like “get bonus points for
reading  (or  forwarding)  our  latest  bulletins.”  This  exercise,  like  most
customer-loyalty efforts, continues forever as well

Watch the initial results of each program for perhaps a week or 10 days,
at  least  at  first  (in  reality,  you’ll  be  watching  and  optimizing  them
indefinitely). Never look at the programs as a whole, since each keep activity
will operate independently.

Cohort Analysis Should Guide your “Keep” Efforts

Cohort  analysis  should  guide  retention  efforts.  A  cohort  is  a  group  of
customers with common attributes, and in the web/mobile channels, the key
cohort  to  watch  is  the  customer  activation  date.  Why?  New  customers  may
stay  for  months,  while  older  customers  may  tire  after  perhaps  three  or  four
months.  New  customers  may  visit  10  times  a  week,  staying  20  minutes  per
visit, while older customers visit twice a week for 10 minutes each time.

Measuring  retention  based  on  averages  can  be  extremely  deceptive,
suggesting,  say,  that  retention  is  OK  since  we  lose  only  8  percent  of  our
customers  every  month.  But  if  those  customers  were  all  heavy  users  or
spenders  or  all  disappear  in  two  months  or  five  months,  the  company
obviously  has  a  problem.  Studying  users  in  terms  of  cohorts  rather  than  in

aggregate makes it much easier to spot danger signs.

Cohort Analysis of a Sales Funnel (Figure 9.9)

Another  important  cohort  to  consider  (usually  when  there  are  at  least
many  thousands  of  customers)  is  users  by  source:  do  customers  referred  by
Google stay longer than or not as long as those referred by Bing or Yahoo?
Do customers who first accept a free trial leave more quickly than those who
pay  from  Day  One?  Each  cohort  analysis  delivers  a  strategy  for  improving
retention.

Optimize “Grow” Customers

There  are  two  ways  to  grow  customers:  get  customers  to  buy  more,  or  get
them to refer other customers to the company.

The  optimization  principles  for  growing  new  revenue  are  described  in

Chapter 3 and can be helped by cohort analysis, described above.

“Grow Customers” Activation Activities in Web/Mobile Channels
(Figure 9.10)

Get Customers to Buy More

Here  are  key  metrics  to  optimize  when  trying  to  grow  revenues  and
customers:

Incremental  dollars  (above  initial  order)  sold,  on  average,  to  all
customers:  if  you’re  not  getting  at  least  15  percent  larger  orders  from
repeat  customers,  you’re  not  working  hard  enough.  Experiment  with
more and different offers, add more generous offers, and find additional
places to make the offers

The  “take  rate:”  This  is  the  percentage  of  customers  reviewing  (and
taking)  an  upsell/next-sell  offer.  It  tells  you  how  well  the  upsell  is
working. Aim for a double-digit take rate even though it may not always
be  achievable.  A/B-test  more  generous  offers  and  spontaneous  offers
that seem urgent (“24-hour sale” or “today only”), and (see above) find
other innovative places, media, and ideas for promoting upsells

Average  order  size:  Also  called  “market  basket”  (a  century-old  term
borrowed  from  the  physical  channel).  Make  the  order  bigger  by  A/B-
testing  a  variety  of  offers,  such  as  longer-term  subscriptions,  “bonus”
products for people taking the upsell offer, and deeper discounts on the
upsell. Remember you’ve already spent the “big” money acquiring this
customer,  so  accept  a  more  narrow  margin  on  these  incremental
revenues

Number of opt-outs or closed accounts resulting from additional offers:
This  is  an  important  “watch  out”  number  that’ll  quickly  tell  you  if
you’re  being  too  pushy.  Look  at  your  overall  opt-out  rate,  and  if  these
grow offers increase that rate by 25 percent or more (it should be around
2 percent or 3 percent), either slow down your efforts, tone down your
copy,  or  call  some  customers  and  find  out  what  they  liked  and  didn’t
like and adjust accordingly

You’ll be amazed how delighted many customers
will be to receive an e-mail or, better yet, a phone
call.

Customer Satisfaction: Getting existing customers to buy more starts by
ensuring that they’re satisfied with the product, its performance and the
price.  Unhappy  customers  won’t  be  buying  from  you  again.  Stay  in
touch with your customers through regular satisfaction surveys, outreach

 
phone calls, and the like

You’ll be amazed how delighted many customers will be to receive an
e-mail or, better yet, a phone call saying, “Hi, we just want to thank you for
your business and find out how you’re liking our product.” You can usually
gently slide in a special offer or a discount on more purchases toward the end
of  the  call  or  e-mail.  These  basic  customer-growth  strategies  work  in
consumer goods as well as business-to-business.

Get Customers to Refer Other Customers

Customer referrals are by far the most powerful, leverageable opportunities to
get  more  customers  and  thus  increase  revenue.  Why?  Because  invitations
from one friend to another saying “try this” are highly credible and often free.
Referral metrics to optimize include:

percentage and number of customers sending e-mails, Tweets, messages
to friends

average number of referrals per customer

conversion (or acceptance) rate of customer referral offers

purchases, activations, or sign-ups per user and per member referred by
other members or customers

Many of the viral marketing techniques discussed earlier, such as getting
users to “like” the company on Facebook or re-Tweet news of a new game or
app,  adds  the  friend’s  credibility  and  endorsement  to  your  marketing
message.  Most  consumers  prefer  to  get  messages  from  friends  rather  than
marketers, knowing their friends wouldn’t tout something of little interest.

Start with Two “Grow” Metrics

Two metrics guide the monitoring of “Grow” efforts: viral growth factor and
customer lifetime value.

The viral growth factor, or viral coefficient, helps measure the number
of activated users referred by your current users. If a user invites five friends
but only one actually activates and buys from or signs up for your site, your

viral coefficient is 1.0 (one user refers one activated new user, or 1 for 1), the
minimum for real viral growth. Think about it—you’d actually double your
audience if every customer got you one more activated customer!!

How do you calculate your viral coefficient?

     Here’s an example. Imagine 100 users of your site each refer 10 friends
who come to your site or app delivering 1,000 “acquired” users lucky
you). Now imagine if 15 percent of those invited friends (150) actually
sign up, buy, or engage (making them activated users).

Calculations:

1.  Start with the number of users (100)

2.  Multiply users by the average number they referred (100×10)

3.  Then compute the average conversion to “activated” users (15%)

4.  You now have 150 new users (15% of 1,000 have activated)

5.  The  result  =  150  new  users  divided  by  100  “old”  users  equal  a  viral

coefficient of 1.5

Work  to  achieve  a  viral  coefficient  greater  than  1.2  or  1.3,  which  is
closer to linear or modest growth and not dramatic. Ideally, you’ll experience
the  kind  of  explosive  growth  seen  from  a  top  YouTube  video,  a  hilarious
joke, or a scam e-mail like “get a free iPad.” Many people forward hilarious
YouTube videos or jokes to dozens of people or more, many of whom watch
the video or read the joke. This can deliver superb viral coefficients of 12, 20,
or even more. The higher the coefficient, the faster the resulting viral growth
and  the  more  customers  you’re  adding  at  any  given  time.  With  any  viral
coefficient below 1, you’re stagnant at best.

A top YouTube video or a hilarious joke can deliver
superb viral coefficients.

Be careful to measure activated users, not just gross referrals, which can
deceive  you.  What  good  is  it  if  a  customer  brings  10  people  to  a  store,  for

 
example, and they sure do like the fashion, but none spend a dime?

The work to increase a viral coefficient is hard—very hard—because it’s
the greatest single source of new customers at the lowest possible cost. Use
all the tactics we’ve already described, including:

A/B test the offer, the copy, the calls to action

Create and test incentives, promotions, deals and discounts

Test a variety of incentives to encourage people to refer their friends...
be sure to incentivize both the current and the potential customer

Apply  the  core  “get  customers”  tactics  to  every  step  in  this  process,
since while this is a referral, it’s all about getting a new customer

Recognize,  too,  that  nothing  creates  great  virality  better  than  a  great
product!  Not  lots  of  people  go  out  of  their  way  to  tell  any  of  their  friends
about  a  boring  company  with  mediocre  products  and  service.  Monitor  the
viral growth factor at least weekly, constantly brainstorming ways to improve
the score.

Optimization never ends.

Keep in mind that not all products on the web are viral. Social media is
viral. Multiplayer games are viral. But there are sites in some categories that
you  definitely  don’t  invite  lots  of  friends  to  (dating  sites,  spouse-cheating
sites,  legal  and  illegal  drug  sites,  etc.).  YouTube  is  perhaps  the  canonical
example  of  a  high-coefficient  site.  Think  about  the  last  hilarious  YouTube
video you viewed. How many friends did you forward it to?

Customer lifetime value (LTV), or how much the customer is worth to
the  company,  can  grow  in  several  different  ways:  a  customer  buys  more,
refers  more  new  customers  or,  in  the  case  of  multi-sided  markets,  become
more active on the site and generate greater revenue for the company. “Grow
customers” programs are the primary driver of lifetime value growth.

Monitor  LTV  growth  over  time,  and  use  new  programs  and  offers  and

improve efficiency.

Multi-sided Markets Must Optimize the “Other

 
Side”

As discussed earlier, startups operating multi-sided markets need to optimize
the “other side” of their market, the side that generates cash. It’s time to get
out of the building and verify the hypothesis that certain advertisers find the
audience  attractive  and  will  pay  the  CPM  ad  rates  that  the  hypothesis
indicates will drive a profitable business model.

While  orders  would  be  lovely  at  this  point,  the  primary  objective  is
validation of the potential revenue so glowingly described in the hypothesis
and your pitch to investors.

Follow  the  “get  customers”  processes  outlined  earlier  (you  are  getting
customers,  after  all),  recognizing  that  you  basically  have  to  do  most  of  the
work  a  second  time.  Why?  The  acquisition  activities  and  sales  pitch  to  the
payer  side  of  a  market  are  totally  different  from  the  materials,  positioning,
and value proposition that attracts free users to the site or app. Don’t expect
orders or revenue yet, since traffic will be negligible, but:

Learn the rules of the game: Does the site need to have a million page
views a week or a month in order to be considered? Are certain ad units
or features required? Is the audience distinctive enough to command an
ad-rate premium? Are there any other rules about content, longevity, or
anything else that might prevent a deal?

Determine the sales roadmap: How long does it take to get an order, and
how many steps does the approval process involve? Does the advertiser
make its buys once or twice a year or on an ongoing basis? How big are
typical initial insertion orders? Who needs to approve the site, the price,
the content? How might you get an order sooner?

Summary: Optimization never ends!

Get Out of the Building: Test Sell Traffic Partners

 It’s not uncommon to hear, “Well, I built a website, but nobody came to
it.” This is the death knell for a startup in the web/mobile channel. You need
partners to drive traffic to your site, whether they run textlinks to you, post
banner ads encouraging their visitors to visit you, or highlight some of your
content or even your features on their site with links to yours. A wide variety
of  partnerships  can  be  used  to  increase  traffic.  In  web  companies,  the
function is often called “business development.”

A few examples of the types of partnerships:

A  social  network  might  get  traffic  from  other  related  commerce  or
content websites

A  kid-game  company  might  offer  a  free  trial  version  on  kid-oriented
websites

A computer parts e-tailer might get traffic from computer-news sites

Meet prospective partners and try to sign the traffic deals you envisioned
in the traffic-partners hypothesis. If you do, how much revenue or traffic will
they actually deliver, and at what cost? Set up meetings with sites that reach
the  same  types  of  customers  you  want  to  reach  and  start  making  deals  like
these:

Feature content from each other’s sites with links to the partner’s site.

Swap e-mail lists so each partner can introduce its users or customers to
the other

Trade  ads  and  textlinks  on  your  partner’s  site  for  those  on  your  own,
using unsold inventory at each site

Highlight the partner as a “content partner” or otherwise promote each
other on site

Create microsites with noncompetitive content or offers on each other’s
sites

Offer one site’s features (social networking or free games, for example)
on the other

The list of traffic opportunities is virtually endless and provides a great
creative challenge that can deliver massive incremental traffic to one partner
or both. When one partner benefits more than the other, cash often brings the
trade  back  into  balance.  Cash  offers  are  the  best  way  to  get  a  prospective
partner’s  attention.  Use  your  initial  conversations  to  compare  the  potential
volume and cost of partner-delivered revenue or traffic with the traffic your
company generates on its own. Get some traffic partnerships going as fast as
you can, and monitor and evaluate the results.

Partnership opportunities are viewed as a dime a
dozen.

Identify  your  target  partners  from  lists  developed  in  the  traffic-partner
hypothesis. Recognize that these meetings are largely exploratory in nature,
since  the  first  question  a  prospective  partner  is  likely  to  ask  is  “How  much
traffic  do  you  have  now?”  and  the  answer  is  probably  very  close  to  zero  at
this stage of the validation process. After all, most partnerships are mutually
beneficial, and before scheduling a meeting, the partner candidate is likely to
want to understand what’s in it for him or her.

These meetings are hard to get. Partnership opportunities are viewed as
a  dime  a  dozen,  and  companies  are  reluctant  to  spend  time  on  all  but  the
biggest opportunities. Some tips for breaking through the barrier:

Use  personal  referrals  and  aggressive  follow-up  as  described  in  the
“customer contacts” section of customer discovery

Focus  the  introductory  e-mail  on  what’s  in  it  for  the  potential  partner.

 
This might include traffic, money, or new customers, depending on how
the partnership works

Explain  your  startup’s  vision  and  why  partnering  with  your  new
company is important

Network  at  appropriate  conferences  and  trade  shows  to  meet  partners
face-to-face

Not  every  deal  needs  to  be  signed  in  these  initial  meetings,  especially
since these commitments are hard to come by

Create a post-meeting report card that assesses and estimates the size of
the opportunity: how much traffic, and how much cost. Use a report card to
track and quantify results.

Customer Validation, Phase Three: Develop
Product and Company Positioning

IN THIS PHASE OF CUSTOMER VALIDATION, you’ll use all the test results from
your  experiments  about  customers,  their  reactions  to  the  initial  value
proposition, and why they buy. The result is two positioning statements: one
for the company and one for the product. In this phase, you’ll:

develop product positioning

match product positioning to market type

develop a company positioning

make  presentations  to  analysts  and  industry  influencers  to  validate  the
positioning

Positioning is the attempt to control the public’s perception of a product
or service as it relates to competitive products. In Phase 1 of validation, you
crafted initial positioning for product and company, but formal positioning at
that  time  would  have  involved  too  much  guesswork.  Now,  with  50  or  250
thousands  of  online  customer
face-to-face  customer 
interactions under your belt, the company has real facts about why customers
buy and real customers to help further test and refine your positioning.

interviews  and 

Thus  far,  even  through  the  validation  stage,  spending  on  customer
acquisition  has  been  modest  and  the  risks  relatively  low.  But  now,  as  the
company  prepares  to  scale  from  dozens  or  hundreds  of  customers  to
thousands  or  even  millions,  it  needs  to  be  able  to  communicate  what  the
product is and does, and why the customer should buy or use it.

No PR Agency

Most  technology-driven  startups  believe  they  need  professional  “marketing
people” from a public relations agency to execute this positioning phase. In
reality, the first pass is best-done (and far more affordably) by the Customer
Development  team  with  feedback  from  Product  Development.  At  this
moment,  no  one  is  closer  to  the  customer  or  better  understands  what
problems customers say the product solves. No one else has struggled to learn
customers  needs,  get  an  order,  and  find  a  repeatable  sales  process.  The
Customer Development team is clearly best-qualified to develop a first pass
at describing what makes the company and the product unique. Later, during
customer  creation,  it’ll  be  time  to  bring  in  the  “experts”  and  their  monthly
retainers and invoices. By then you’ll be able to hand them facts explaining
why customers bought.

The Positioning Audit

Before the company spends time on positioning, it’s a good idea to air out the
conference  room  and  get  some  facts.  The  best  way  to  do  this  is  with  a
positioning audit. An audit is an unbiased way to learn how others perceive
your  company  and  products.  An  external  audit  interviews  a  representative
sample of people from a variety of categories, including customers who know
or have heard of your company and those who don’t; others who will carry
your message for you (industry analysts and influencers, bloggers, members
of  the  press,  and  others);  competitors  and  others  who  are  knowledgeable
about the industry or market.

Example of an External Audit Questionnaire (Figure 10.1)

Each  interview  asks  these  groups  a  series  of  questions  about  how  they
perceive  your  company  and  its  key  competitors:  Do  they  know  and  respect
your  product,  your  reputation,  and  your  leadership?  Do  they  think  your
company  is  a  credible,  trustworthy  provider  of  the  product  or  service  it’s
selling,  and  where  do  they  think  it  fits  in  the  competitive  set?  The  results
form a baseline of the perceptions others have about your company.

Form a baseline of the perceptions others have
about your company.

Once  you  understand  what  others  think  (usually  a  surprise  to  most
startups  breathing  the  rarefied  air  of  their  own  conference  rooms),  the
company can work on changing and shaping those opinions. An example of
an external audit questionnaire for customers, press, influencers, and analysts
is shown in Figure 10.1.

While  conducting  an  audit  is  the  kind  of  activity  pr  agencies  excel  at,
handing this function off completely is a serious mistake in a startup. Just as
your early sales calls were too important to be handled by salespeople, your
early audits are too important to be handed off to a pr agency. The members
of  the  founding  team  should  at  least  perform  the  first  five  or  ten  calls
themselves.

Listening  to  external  perceptions  of  the  company  is  half  of  this  audit
step. Listening inside the company is the other half. An internal audit directs
the same questions to the founding team executive staff and board members.
Most  startups  assume  they  have  complete  internal  unanimity  on  the  all  the
issues  in  the  external  audit.  An  internal  audit  will  probably  reveal  that  you
have a cacophony of voices (and you most definitely don’t want to be out of
sync with your investors.) The internal audit should unearth those differences
and extract new ideas. When the company has agreed on a final positioning at
the  end  of  this  phase,  you  communicate  those  ideas  back  to  the  entire
organization so it speaks with one voice.

Develop Positioning: Product Positioning

 
In  this  step  you’ll  put  a  stake  in  the  ground  and  formalize  the  product’s
positioning.  The  positioning  doesn’t  have  to  be  perfect,  since  it  will  be
refined  further  during  customer  creation.  The  result  of  this  product-
positioning  step  is  a  one-page  “product  positioning  brief”  that  updates  the
positioning  briefs  developed  earlier.  As  sales  literature  (data  sheets,  sales
presentations,  website  and  copy)  and  marketing  campaigns  are  created,  this
brief should be used to keep all the messages “on point.”

Feedback  from  customers  and  channel  partners  in  customer  discovery
and  customer  validation  has  continually  refined  or  affirmed  the  answer  to
what  your  positioning  is.  You  wrote  your  first  version  of  a  positioning
statement when you created the sales presentation, answering the question of
why  an  early  customer  should  buy  the  product.  Think  about  customers’
reaction  to  that  description.  Did  it  generate  excitement?  Was  it  credible?  If
customers couldn’t or didn’t explain why the product was interesting to them
—or  not—do  you  understand  why?  If  not,  re-contact  them  and  find  out  the
reasons. There’s no better input into product positioning than feedback from
folks who were exposed to the product itself.

The Product Positioning Brief

Return  to  the  simple,  single-phrase  positioning  statement  you  developed  at
the  outset  of  customer  validation  (remember  “Absolutely  positively
overnight”  from  FedEx?).  Did  it  resonate  with  the  customers  encountered
during  the  validation  process?  Did  they  find  think  it  explained  why  they
should  buy  the  product  or  what  it  did,  and  did  they  find  it  credible  and
effective? If not, back to the drawing board.

To refresh your memory, review product positioning example developed

early in Chapter 8 (which may have been several months ago by now):

Example of Product Positioning (Figure 10.2)

A  thorough  positioning  effort  made  soon  after  customer-validation
interviews  will  often  save  the  company  time  and  money  at  the  start  of
customer  creation.  If  it  already  knows  how  to  position  the  new  product
against competition in a way that resonates with customers, it can hire a pr or
marketing communications agency and have it get right to work creating buzz
or  promotional  materials  or  both.  Neither  time  nor  dollars  are  wasted  on
ponderous, costly positioning studies and analyses. Instead, the agency is told
“here’s  the  positioning.  Run  with  it  unless  you  have  a  significantly  better
idea.”  The  agency  will  know  how  to  package  the  product,  the  pr  messages,
and  other  marketing  communications  tools  and  can  get  right  to  work
generating  results.  (Agencies  hate  this,  because  thinking  and  “strategizing”
are far more lucrative and less accountable activities.)

Develop Positioning: Match Positioning to Market
Type

Market type dramatically changes the messages your company wants to send
about itself and its products. So now it’s time to match the positioning to the
market type you’ve selected.

For an Existing Market

If you’re entering an existing market, company positioning is about creating
the  notion  that  your  company  is  both  different  and  credible.  And  solves  a
problem  that  customers  believe  is  important.  When  Apple  entered  the
smartphone market, people understood that the company was a manufacturer
of iPods but was now going to offer a phone and a web browser, too.

Once your company positioning is chosen, product positioning follows.
Since  in  an  existing  market  comparable  products  exist,  product  positioning
typically describes how and why your product is different along an existing
axis/basis of competition. Differentiation in an existing market can take one
of  three  forms:  you  can  describe  differences  in  product  attributes  (faster,

minutes, home delivery, see your nearest dealer, build it yourself on the web),
or  in  service  (five-year,  50,000-mile  automobile  warranty,  90-day  money-
back guarantee, lifetime warranty). Or it can take the form of how the product
fills a need or solves a problem the customer was searching for.

For a New Market

If  you’re  creating  a  new  market,  company  positioning  can’t  be  about  how

different your company is, since by definition there are no other companies to
compare it with in a new market. So in a new market, company positioning is
about communicating a vision of and passion for what could be. It answers
the  questions  “What’s  wrong  with  the  world  that  you  want  to  make  right?”
and  “What  is  it  that  your  company  is  trying  to  change?”  When  Airbnb
“peer-to-peer”
reinvented 
accommodations, they first had to communicate a radical idea: people would
want  to  rent  out  their  homes  to  strangers  who  would  want  to  stay  in  other
strangers’ homes.

breakfasts  with 

hotel/motel/bed 

and 

After positioning the company, positioning the product in a new market
becomes  pretty  simple.  Touting  a  new  product’s  features  is  unproductive,
since  there’s  no  context  for  understanding  them—no  comparable  products
exist—and customers have no idea what you’re talking about. If Airbnb had
positioned its service as “rooms for $89” or “sleep in a stranger’s bed” no one
would have had a clue what it was talking about. Instead, Airbnb positioning
talked about a “sharing economy” and emphasized the economic benefits for
both parties.

In a Clone Market

Cloning a business model from the U.S. that hasn’t made it to your country
(due  to  language,  cultural  or  legal  barriers)  is  a  viable  business  strategy.
Clones  are  typically  found  in  countries  such  as  China,  Russia,  Brazil,  India
and  Indonesia  that  are  large  enough  to  grow  companies  to  substantial  size
(greater than 100 million people).

Company positioning can’t be about how different your company is, as
there are no other companies in your country to compare it with, but you can
act as if you can predict the future. You know how the equivalent companies
are positioned in the U.S. Clone their positioning.

The  same  is  true  for  product  positioning.  Touting  a  new  product’s
features  is  unproductive  at  first,  as  there’s  no  immediate  context  for
understanding  the  features—no  comparable  products  exist—and  customers
have no idea what you’re talking about. But here again you can pretend to be
psychic. You know how the equivalent companies are positioned in the U.S.
As soon as the market is educated, clone their positioning.

For Re-Segmenting a Market

If you’re re-segmenting an existing market, company positioning depends on
market segmentation. Segmentation means you’ve picked a clear and distinct
spot in customers’ minds that’s unique and understandable. Most important,
concerns something they value and want and need now. Company positioning
for  this  market  type  communicates  your  deep  understanding  of  customer
problems/needs 
for  un-or  underserved  markets.  And  your  astute
understanding of how to uniquely solve it.

There are two types of market re-segmentation; a segmented niche and a
low-cost provider. Two examples of low-cost re-segmentation are Jetblue and
Southwest  Airlines.  Both  offer  cheap  fares  matched  by  minimal  frills,  they
entered  the  airline  business  low-cost  passenger  airlines  that  provide  high-
quality customer service on point-to-point routes.

There are two types of market re-segmentation; a
segmented niche and a low-cost provider.

The  rise  of  Walmart  was  another  example  of  an  entrepreneur’s
recognition that an existing market was ripe for a niche re-segmentation. In
the  1960s  and  ’70s,  Sears  and  Kmart  dominated  big-box  discount  retailing,
opening  large  stores  where  there  was  sufficient  population  to  sustain  them.
Smaller  communities  got  catalog  stores  (Sears)  or  were  simply  ignored
(Kmart). Sam Walton saw towns dismissed as “too small” as an opportunity.
“Small towns first” was his unique niche re-segmentation. Once established,
Walmart  proudly  positioned  itself  as  a  “discounter”—a  sobriquet  the  large
retailers  avoided  like  the  plague.  They  sold  name-brand  health  and  beauty
aids  at  cost.  This  strategy,  supported  by  heavy  advertising,  pulled  in
customers who then bought other products which, while priced low, carried
high  gross  margins.  Equally  important,  Walmart  adoption  of  cutting-edge
technology  to  track  how  people  shop  and  to  buy,  and  its  ability  to  deliver
goods  more  efficiently  and  cheaply  reduced  its  cost  of  sales  to  a  small
fraction of competitors’. By 2002, Kmart was bankrupt and Walmart was the
largest company in the world.

When you’re re-segmenting a market, product positioning is a hybrid of
market and existing market positionings. Since your segmentation has moved

 
your  product  into  a  space  adjacent  to  your  competitors,  product  positioning
describes how and why your new segment is different and important to your
customers.

Develop Positioning: Company Positioning

With  the  product  positioned  in  one  of  the  four  market  types,  articulate
company  positioning  the  same  way.  What’s  the  difference  between  product
positioning  and  company  positioning?  Product  positioning  focused  on  the
specific product attributes within a market type, while company positioning
answers the questions “What does this company do for me?” and “Why do I
want to do business with them?” and “Why does this company exist and how
is it different?”

Write the first version of a company positioning statement as simply as
possible,  always  keeping  customers  in  mind.  Describe  the  company  to
encourage  potential  customers  to  say,  “Tell  me  more.  It  sounds  like  you’re
solving a problem I have.”

Here’s a great but verbose example from Amazon.com: “We seek to be
Earth’s  most  customer-centric  company  for  three  primary  customer  sets:
consumer customers, seller customers, and developer customers.” UPS points
to  its  breadth:  “As  the  world’s  largest  package  delivery  company  and  a
leading  global  provider  of  specialized  transportation  and  logistics  services,
logistics,  supply  chain
UPS  continues 
management, and e-Commerce, ...combining the flows of goods, information,
and  funds.”  One  more,  from  the  simpler,  more  narrowly  focused  Zappos,
speaks  volumes  about  why  you’d  want  to  do  business  with  the  company:
“We’ve  aligned  the  entire  organization  around  one  mission:  to  provide  the
best  customer  service  possible.  Internally,  we  call 
this  our  WOW
philosophy.”  Notice,  that  company  positioning  is  not  about  product  or
features.

the  frontiers  of 

to  develop 

Sometimes,  founders  creating  a  new  market  are  tempted  to  name  the
new  market.  This  can  be  helpful  or,  more  often,  dangerous  and  expensive.
Generally  it’s  helpful  only  if  it  helps  explain  the  product’s  attributes,  with

terms  like  handheld  video  game  or  instant photography.  If  the  new  market
name  is  cute  or  esoteric,  prepare  to  spend  lots  of  money  explaining  the
market and why it’s important to customers, who need a frame of reference to
understand the company positioning. No-frills airlines and movies on demand
explain  markets  and  position  new  companies  within  them.  Tivo  spent
hundreds of millions convincing customers it wasn’t a digital VCR.

Table 10.2 illustrates company positioning by market type. Like product
positioning, company positioning doesn’t have to be perfect yet, since it will
be refined further during customer creation.

Company Positioning by Market Type (Table 10.2)

As  with  product  positioning,  the  result  of  this  exercise  should  be  a
“company  positioning  brief,”  brief  being  the  operative  word.  As  marketing
literature (press backgrounder, sales presentations, website) unfolds, this brief
will be used in conjunction with the product brief for consistency’s sake.

As  a  consistency  check  for  company  positioning,  revisit  the  mission
statement  written  during  customer  discovery.  How  did  customers  react  to  it
during validation interviews? Did they find that explained why the company
is different or special and encourage them to do business with the company?

In addition, compare the company’s description and mission statement with
those of its competitors. What are their company positionings, and is the new
company’s  positioning  distinct  or  differentiated,  particularly  as  buyers  are
concerned.  Is  it  simple?  Beware:  unsubstantiated  superlatives  like  easiest,
best and greatest are meaningless. Demonstrable, provable claims like fastest
and cheapest are stronger, although cheapest is a high-risk strategy as a rule,
since competition can quickly respond.

Unsubstantiated superlatives like easiest, best and
greatest are meaningless. Demonstrable, provable
claims like fastest and cheapest are stronger.

Develop Positioning: Validate Positioning

Industry  analysts  and  influencers  help  deliver  the  foundation  of  credibility
that  a  startup  needs.  What’s  an  industry  analyst?  In  the  technology  arena,
many firms charge customers to provide an “independent” and dispassionate
analysis of markets, trends, or specific products and their fit in those markets.
These firms vary in size and influence. In some technical markets (enterprise
software, for example) sales to large companies are very difficult until one of
the large analyst firms (Gartner, Forrester, Yankee) has blessed the product,
particularly  if  it’s  new.  In  the  entertainment  business  it  might  be  Kagan,  in
consumer products the NPD group.

Unlike  analysts,  industry  influencers  are  a  less  formal  category.  Every
industry  has  a  handful  of  pundits  who  publish  articles,  write  blogs  or  hold
conferences,  and  their  prominence  in  the  field  influences  what  gets  talked
about.  Sometimes  these  influentials  work  at  industry-leading  companies  but
speak  at  lots  of  conferences.  Other  influentials  include  writers  at  general,
business, or trade publications. Sometimes they teach at universities.

Test to see if they’ll sing your company song.

Identification of key analysts and industry influencers began in customer
discovery.  Meet  them  and  get  their  insights  and  feedback  on  the  initial
positioning  (market,  product,  and  company)  just  created  and  their  thoughts
about product features. Test to see if they’ll sing your company song (and if
not,  figure  out  why).  Even  though  early  adopters  will  be  evangelizing  the
product inside their company or to their friends and family, it helps to have
other “outsiders” who will say, “Yes, we’ve heard of them, and while it’s too
early to say how good their product is, we think their idea is quite valuable.”

 
It’s also important to line up industry analysts and influencers as references
for press interactions in the customer creation step.

All  this  would  have  been  difficult  without  real  customer  contacts,
feedback,  and  orders,  but  now  it’s  appropriate  to  contact  the  analysts  and
influencers  who  have  been  tracked  since  early  on  in  customer  discovery.
Hopefully,  their  names  were  recorded  in  a  database  after  the  company  met
them  at  conferences,  seminars,  and  trade  shows.  Before  any  meeting,  the
team  should  spend  time  understanding  their  opinions  on  the  market  and
product space (if not, don’t use the meetings in this phase to get up to speed;
do the homework first).

Before  contacting  analysts  and  influencers,  be  sure  to  understand  what
companies  and  industries  their  firms  cover  and  what  particular  area  or
companies the individual analysts cover. (There’s nothing worse than seeing
the wrong person or even the wrong company. It tells everyone that nobody
did  their  homework.)  Develop  a  short  script  explaining  why  they  should
meet.  Understand  what  they  cover  and  explain  why  the  new  company  will
shake up their market and why the product and company are important. With
this accomplished, the “what’s in it for them” is obvious; they won’t want to
miss an influential and important company. (They’ll almost certainly also try
to sell their consulting services, which at least theoretically have no bearing
on their opinion about the new client’s product.) Make sure to reference early
customers  and  the  problem/pain  points  that  the  product  solves  for  them.
When  they  agree  to  meet,  ask  how  much  time  they’ll  allocate,  what
presentation format they like (formal slides, demo, whiteboard talk, etc.) and
whether  the  presentation  should  focus  on  technology,  markets,  customers,
problems, or all the above.

Each analyst organization or influencer has a view
of the market or products it covers.

Assemble  the  presentation,  keeping  in  mind  this  isn’t  a  sales  pitch.
Focus  on  market  and  product  positioning  as  well  as  details  of  product
features. The objective is to validate the product and company positions and,
wherever  possible,  to  influence  analysts’  thinking,  not  to  sell  them.  Each
analyst  organization  or  influencer  has  a  view  of  the  market  or  products  it
covers—understand that view upfront (know it well enough to draw it on the

 
board).  If  creating  a  new  market,  get  the  slides  describing  its  view  of  the
adjacent markets it will affect.

Meeting an industry influencer may require the same formal preparation
as meeting an analyst, or it may be a lunch at a nearby pub. Do the homework
to  understand  how  the  influencers  acquire  and  disseminate  information
upfront, and adjust presentation length and style accordingly.

When  meeting  influencers  and  analysts,  remember  that  the  goal  is  to
gather feedback (and hope for wild enthusiasm). Also use the interaction to
gather intelligence about the marketplace. Make a mental checklist of critical
learning objectives. For example:

What other companies are doing anything similar?

How does the new company’s vision fit with market needs?

With customer needs?

How can the company best position its product, its place in the market,
and the company itself?

Is the product pricing right?

How does it compare with competitors’ pricing?

The  analysts  can  often  clarify  who  in  a  company  the  sale  should  be
made  to  and  the  kinds  of  obstacles  that  will  be  faced.  With  feedback  from
analysts and influencers as well several real customers, continue to the next
and final phase of customer validation.

Customer Validation, Phase Four: The
Toughest Question of All: Pivot or Proceed?

THIS  IS  THE  MOST  CRITICAL,  MOST  GUT-WRENCHING  phase  of  customer
validation:  honestly  determining  whether  there’s  a  scalable,  profitable
business  model  ahead.  Is  the  company  ready  to  go  forward  to  the  customer
creation step, when millions of dollars are often spent to fuel rapid customer
growth?  This  step  literally  “calls  the  question”  about  the  company’s  future
directions. It’s time to study all the test results, all the customer learning and
all the insights you’ve had from the facts you’ve gathered. Its time to see if
the company is ready to start spending money to scale, and that the result will
be a great, profitable company.

There are three steps to answering the crucial “pivot or proceed” question:

Assemble and review all key discovery and validation findings

Review  the  business  model  hypotheses  and  their  interactions  with  one
another

Focus on the “metrics that matter” in the financial model

Pivot or Proceed: Assemble Data Findings

By  this  point,  the  team  has  assembled  a  massive  amount  of  hard  data:

industry  research,  customer  segments,  customer  feedback,  marketing
program results, channel and cost input and much more. The data needs to be
verified, with any gaps, discrepancies, or anomalies filled in along the way. A
few examples:

The company needs 10,000 customers in order to be profitable, but the
market isn’t that large

Customer  acquisition  or  channel  costs  are  too  high,  rendering  the
company unprofitable

The  sales  roadmap  is  too  long  and  complex,  making  the  cost  of  sales
way too high

Despite best efforts, referrals just aren’t delivering additional customers

These anomalies are relatively easy to spot when all the data is collected
in  one  room.  They  often  call  for  further  customer,  channel,  or  product
development discussions. At times, they drive a business model pivot.

The best way to “translate” piles of data, is to make
it as visual as possible.

Build a War Room

The  best  way  to  “translate”  piles  of  data,  reports  and  questionnaires  is  to
make  it  as  visual  as  possible.  For  best  results,  lock  the  founding  team  in  a
room for a day or two to walk step by step through each hypothesis. Cover
one wall with a blown up “final” business model canvas. Cover the other wall
with the hypotheses themselves, sorted to keep the pieces of each hypothesis
together (remember, many hypotheses have multiple parts). Use another wall
for  supporting  diagrams,  and  allow  space  for  the  most  recent  canvas  and
perhaps one or two earlier iterations. Leave a large whiteboard available for
keeping score of questions and changes and for the key “metrics that matter”
numbers that emerge (discussed in detail in Step 3). While not every diagram
is appropriate for your startup, review:

 
a  work-flow  map  of  the  prototypical  customer  that  diagrams  how
customers do their jobs or live their lives both with and without the new
product

an  organizational/influence  map  showing  whom  consumers  or
businesspeople interact with, how often, and how those people influence
buying decisions.

customer archetypes: how they earn and spend their money and use their
time

a market map showing where your customers will come from

a channel or sales roadmap diagramming how sales will happen

a  fully  updated  business  model  canvas  (along  with  a  few  earlier
versions)

Review the Data

The most important hard data to review includes:

customer  feedback,  particularly  from  sales  report  cards  evaluating
customer enthusiasm for the product and its potential sales revenue over
time

market size and market share estimates

channel feedback and revenue potential summaries

pricing, customer acquisition costs, and any major product cost changes

detailed  information  about  the  industry,  the  customers,  and  their
behavior

competitive product and pricing information

results of your web “get, keep and grow” tests

details  of  your  customer  acquisition  costs  and  viral  coefficient  and  the
latest  stats  on  page  views  per  visit,  visit  frequency,  user  growth,  and

retention optimization

user-testing  results,  showing  the  rate  of  improvement  for  activation,
conversion, retention and growth activities

The  team,  often  including  investors,  should  review  all  the  materials  to
ensure that all the learning from discovery and validation has been integrated
into  the  latest  versions  of  the  hypothesis  documents  and  into  an  updated
version of the business model canvas that will be discussed in the next step.
The key activity at this stage is to look at the intersections of, or interactions
among,  the  business  model  components,  since  no  doubt  many  components
have  changed  along  the  way.  The  process  is  a  healthy  one,  and  the  results
fuel the next steps of the pivot-or-proceed process.

Look at the intersections of, or interactions among
the business model components.

The  Business  Model  Checklist  (Figure  11.2)  gives  you  and  your
management  team  the  questions  you  should  be  asking  and  worrying  about.
Print  them  out.  Keep  them  handy.  And  worry  “Am  I  going  to  bet  my
company that I got them right?”

Pivot or Proceed: Validate Your Business Model

It’s  been  a  long  road  but  you’ve  converted  most  of  your  business  model
hypotheses from customer discovery into facts. You’ve done so by extensive
testing  through  face-to-face  customer  interactions.  So,  if  the  customer-
relationships  hypothesis  said  one  of  every  five  acquired  customers  will
activate and pay for the service or app, this actually happened in validation,
with  hundreds  if  not  thousands  of  customers.  Or  you’ve  proven  that  people
return to the product or app three times a week for an average of 20 minutes
per visit or spend $100 a month visiting once.

Review Business Model Hypotheses (Figure 11.1)

The  team  should  assemble  data  collected  in  the  last  phase  in  its  “war
room” use the checklist to walk through the business model hypotheses, box
by  box,  and  ascertain  that  there  are  factual,  definitive  answers  to  at  least
every question on the checklist.

In  this  final  phase  of  customer  validation  the  company  asks  itself  the
same questions it asked in Phase 4 of customer discovery. But at this point, it
should have much more quantitative, irrefutable proof of the answers, since
you’ve spoken to far more customers and conducted many more tests.

 Web/mobile startups have a unique set of business model hypotheses
that  they  need  to  validate,  particularly  in  the  “Get/Keep/Grow”  Customer
Relationships area. These questions include:

Has the company proven it can acquire and activate a steadily-increasing
number of customers at a cost in line with the cost structure?

Are  the  customers  being  acquired  demonstrating  that  they  will  spend
and “stick” with the company at rates that will deliver the revenue plan?

And  are  customers  referring  other  good  quality  customers  in  sufficient
numbers to deliver these often-free new customers, reducing the average
acquisition cost?

In  multi-sided  markets,  are  customers  visiting  often  enough,
participating actively enough, and staying active long enough to help the
company generate the revenues it needs to succeed?

The Business Model Canvas as a Scorecard

Hopefully  you’ve  been  taking  regular  snapshots  of  your  business  model
canvas  –  either  week-by-week  snapshots,  or  at  least  at  each  major  pivot.  If
you’ve  done  it  this  way  you  now  essentially  have  a  film  strip  of  the
entrepreneurial process.

As you can see from Figure 11.1, each stage of discovery and validation
refined  the  canvas.  Experiments  were  run,  learning  caused  iterations  and  a
few pivots, and all were documented in a new canvas (reread for tips).

Now that you have your canvases up on the wall use them as a point of

discussion.

The answers to “Is this a business?” can be found in
the results of the multitude of tests you’ve
conducted throughout the validation process.

The  answers  to  “Is  this  a  business?”  can  be  found  in  the  results  of  the
multitude of tests you’ve conducted throughout the validation process. As is
often the case, when the results aren’t convincing enough, or when they don’t
deliver the traffic or financial targets of the business model, it’s time to iterate
or pivot, and retest to see if the new approach improves the results. After all,
the company will very shortly be spending millions of dollars in the customer
creation  phase,  where  results  are  expected  to  be  far  more  predictable,  and
much more is at risk. While this may seem ambitious and unreasonable, the
closer  a  company  is  to  this  “fact-based  plan,”  the  greater  its  chances  for
business and fund-raising success.

This step answers one key question: do all the tests point to a scalable, sizable
business? And can it happen before the company runs out of money?

In  this  step,  you’ll  figure  out  whether  you  have  a  potentially  thriving

business, a hobby, or a tax loss.

Answering the question doesn’t require pounds of Excel spreadsheets or
50-item budgets. It relies more on the facts you’ve developed by testing your
original  hypotheses  with  the  only  people  who  have  the  answers,  your
customers, and with a short list of numbers, the metrics that matter.

A mere handful of numbers define the difference
between a scalable, profitable business and a
failure.

A  mere  handful  of  numbers  define  the  difference  between  a  scalable,
profitable  business  and  a  failure.  Successful  entrepreneurs  will  be  able  to
recite,  adjust,  and  recompute  this  handful  or  so  of  key  numbers  about
customers, product costs, and revenue growth while they sleep. Meanwhile,
they’re  always  focused  on  the  two  metrics  that  matter  most:  how  many
months’  worth  of  cash  remain  in  the  bank?  And  how  fast  are  we  burning
through what’s left?

We guarantee that this different approach to finance will get you thrown
out  of  just  about  every  business  school  in  the  country,  but  it’s  all  that’s
needed  at  this  stage  to  determine  whether  your  business  model  passes  the
validation test and is ready to move on from validation to scale in customer
creation.

 
Metrics that Matter

Since  page  1  of  this  book  you’ve  been  using  the  business  model  canvas  to
organize  your  testing.  In  this  section  we’re  going  to  use  the  canvas  to
organize  your  financial  model.  This  is  a  radically  different  approach
compared to more typical use of 5-year revenue forecast spreadsheets. Think
of  it  as  bringing  your  “report  card”  home  to  Mom  and  Dad—hopefully,  a
report  card  full  of  A’s  and  A+’s,  since  B  and  C  responses  do  not  a  great
company  make.  Some  elements  of  the  business  model  represent  revenue  or
costs, while others fuel growth. Physical and web/mobile channel costs vary
widely,  as  do  rates  of  sale  and  growth,  so  one  last  time  we’ll  examine  the
metrics three different ways:

In a physical channel, less than a dozen numbers usually tell the entire story:

Value proposition: What are product cost, market size, attainable market
share, and customer impact of network effects?

Customer Relationships: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect
conversion rates, customer lifetime value, and customer switching costs
that the company may have to pay?

Market  Type:  As  discussed  in  Chapter  1,  different  market  types  drive
different revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions

Cost Structure: What are the basic operating costs of the business?

Channel:  What  are  the  costs  of  selling  through  the  channel?  Channel
margin, promotion, shelf-space charges?

Revenue Streams:  What  are  the  average  selling  price,  total  achievable
revenue, and number of customers a year?

Burn Rate  (derived  from  the  above):  How  much  cash  is  the  company
“burning” (spending) a month? When will the company run out of cash?
There’s no precise formula for what a burn rate should be, but since it’s
the issue over which boards most often fire their founders, the founders
and investors must agree on what the burn rate should be and how many
more  pivots  the  startup  can  afford  in  its  search  for  the  scalable,
profitable business model

 In the web/mobile channel, less than a dozen numbers tell the entire

story:

Value proposition: What is the estimated per-user cost of a user, and are
there any incremental costs when one’s added. Estimate the market size,
attainable market share, and the customer impact of referrals or network
effects

Customer Relationships: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect
conversion  and  retention  rates,  and  how  many  new  customers  or  users
will your current customers get you virally, for free?

Market  Type:  As  discussed  in  Chapter  1,  different  market  types  drive
different revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions

Cost Structure: What are the basic operating costs of the business? (Be
sure  not  to  mingle  or  double-count  these  costs  with  your  value
proposition costs)

Channel: What are the costs of selling through the channel: payments to
app stores, marketplace sites like Amazon.com, or related sites referring
customers to you?

Revenue Streams:  What  are  the  average  selling  price,  total  achievable
revenue,  and  number  of  customers  a  year,  and  how  long  or  how  often
will customers spend?

Burn Rate  (derived  from  the  above):  How  much  cash  is  the  company
“burning” (spending) a month? When will the company run out of cash?

A Few Words about Burn Rate

Venture  capitalist  Fred  Wilson  suggests  some  burn-rate  guidelines  for
venture  funded  web/mobile  businesses  that  may  be  helpful  to  entrepreneurs
of  all  stripes.  Wilson’s  advice  looks  at  burn  rate  based  on  the  company’s
growth stage.

Customer discovery, which he calls the “building product” stage, should
keep the burn rate between $50,000 and $75,000 a month, which should
fund a team of three or four engineers building the MVP as well as the

founding team, rent, operating costs and the like

Customer validation, Wilson’s “building usage” stage, shouldn’t exceed
a burn rate of $100,000 a month. This stage begins when product/market
fit  is  achieved  and  fuels  the  “get  customers”  and  MVP  iteration
discussed in this chapter

Customer  creation,  Wilson’s  “building  the  business”  stage,  should
ideally hold the burn rate to $250,000 a month as the company builds a
team,  expands  marketing  activities,  and  starts  generating  material
revenues

These are guidelines, and there are zillions of exceptions.

Assemble all your test results to provide a forecast for the coming year,
which begins on Day One of Step 3 of Customer Development, the customer
creation process.

We  doubt  there  have  been  many  startups  where  the  year-one  financial
results of customer creation matched the “metrics that matter.” But any VC,
uncle or rich neighbor is going to want to know why you think an investment
in your startup will deliver startup-size returns. If at the end of this step the
numbers  are  ugly—yup,  you  guessed  it—turn  back  to  the  beginning  of
discovery,  or  at  least  customer  validation,  and  start  revising  and  retesting
your hypotheses.

Three things to consider before you dive into Metrics That Matter:

Use  the  time  frames  that  make  the  most  sense  for  your  startup.
Generally,  the  longer  the  physical-channel  sales  cycle  (think  enterprise
software), the longer the “space” between calculations should be. Here
we used a quarter-by-quarter forecast

An analysis like this can—and should—often stop the pivot–or-proceed
process in its tracks if the computation forecasts that the company will
either run out of money within the year or won’t be able to raise enough
funds to survive the first year of customer creation

Don’t be in a hurry at this critical step. As an entrepreneur, if you take a
pile of money to move forward here and fail, it will at least cost you a
significant  portion  of  your  founders’  equity,  and  it  will  often  cost  you

your job

Metrics that Matter Scenarios

Metrics  matters  are  a  radically  new  approach  to  startup  math.  They’re  best
illustrated  by  example.  The  spreadsheet  scenario  on  the  following  pages
illustrates how you can use “Metrics that Matter” to evaluate your business if
you  are  selling  a  web/moile  product  in  the  web/mobile  channel  or  in  a
multisided web/mobile market.

Metrics that Matter: Example 1

Expense Reporter Sold via Web/mobile Channels

 Let’s take a look at Table 11.1, another $30 retail product, downloadable

XpensePro software, sold through the web/mobile channels only.

“Metrics That Matter”: Web/Mobile Sales Model (Table 11.1)
Note: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that
follows.

In this scenario, our hypothetical company is selling XpensePro only as

a web or mobile app download directly from its website and via app stores.
As in the previous example, things are factored into the numbers above:

Product-development cost is heavy at first and then declines.

Incremental product unit costs are practically zero, since the product is a
download

Revenue  never  scales  dramatically,  since  the  market  type  is  “re-
segmenting/niche  market,”  but  the  year-to-year  revenue  increases  are
significant enough to promise downstream success

This  angel-funded  business  starts  with  $300,000  cash  remaining.  More
money will be hard to get

What Metrics Matter?

There are five metrics that matter in this spreadsheet:
     •   Revenue comes from three channels

   Direct revenue from web sales, net of acquisition cost
   Direct mobile sales revenues, after subtracting referral incentives
   Revenue from the appstore channel, after subtracting channel fees

and marketing costs

     •   Cash burned or made during the period
     •   Cash remaining at the end of the quarter

Because  the  business  is  operating  in  three  distinct  channels,  each  of
which operates differently, it takes 17 different numbers to create the above
five metrics, but the board just needs to focus on five rather than 17. If one’s
ever out of whack or way off budget, drill down into the supporting details
numbers  that  make  that  number  up:  unit  sales,  gross  direct  revenue,  cost  of
customers or sales, and net revenue from the channel.

Following the left-hand column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of
each number and its source:

Web Sales:

1.      Direct  web  unit  sales:  How  many  web  apps  are  downloaded  from  the

          
          
          
company’s  site.  Customers  are  unlikely  to  make  multiple  purchases
within a year.

2.      Gross  direct  revenue:  Multiply  the  number  of  units  (No.  1)  by  the

average selling price of $30.

3.   (Less) customer acquisition cost: The cost to make a sale over the web
On  average,  $6  worth  of  AdWords,  incentives,  e-mail  and  the  like  to
acquire one customer. Multiply $6 by the number of solid units (No. 1).

4.      Net  web  revenue  total:  Subtract  the  customer  acquisition  cost  (No.  3)

from the gross direct revenue from website sales (No. 2).

5.   Direct mobile unit sales: A few customers will find and download the
app’s mobile version at the company website (most will find it at the app
stores).  Calculate  the  quarterly  units  using  the  process  described  in  EZ
Gardner metric #1.

On the surface, this looks like a really lovely
business.

6.   Gross revenue/direct mobile units: Multiply the number of mobile units

sold directly to customers (No. 5) by $30, the average selling price.

7.      (Less)  referral  incentive:  The  customer-relationships  hypothesis
indicates  that  a  third  of  the  company’s  direct  sales  will  come  from
referrals by happy customers encouraged by a $4 incentive. Take 1/3 of
the directsales web (No. 1) and mobile (No. 5) units and multiply by $4.

8.      DIRECT  mobile  revenue  total:  How  much  cash  winds  up  in  the
company’s  bank  from 
this  channel?  Multiply  units  (No.  5)  by
revenue/unit  (No.  6)  and  then  subtract  the  referral  incentive  (No.  7)  to
find the answer.

9.      CHANNEL  app-store  sales  (units):  Calculate  units  using  the  channel

method outlined in EZ Gardner unit sales #3.

10.  CHANNEL gross revenue: multiply the channel units sold (No. 9) by

the retail price of $30.

11.    (Less)  market/app-store  30%  fee:  Every  download  sold  will  cost  the

 
company an app store fee of 30 percent, or $9. Multiply units (No. 9) by
$9.00 and subtract it from channel revenue (No. 10).

12.    TOTAL  NET  APPSTORE  revenue:  Subtract  the  app-store  fee  (No.
11)  from  channel  revenue  (No.  10)  to  find  the  amount  of  cash  that  will
wind up in the company’s bank from app-store sales.

13.    TOTAL  NET  revenue  (all  channels):  Add  three  revenue  numbers—
No.  4  (direct  web  revenue),  No.  8  (direct  mobile  revenue),  and  No.  12
(net channel revenue)—to compute the company’s net sales.

14.  (Less) product/product-development costs: What does it cost to build
and  make  the  product?  Compute  your  ongoing  product  development
costs, plus download and bandwidth charges. There’s no physical cost of
the product itself.

15.    (Less)  current  operating  costs:  Compute  the  costs  of  turning  on  the

lights at the company every day, as in Example 1, line 9.

16.  CASH BURN FOR PERIOD: Did we make or lose money this quarter?
How  much?  Follow  the  process  for  calculating  cash  burn  outlined  in
Spreadsheet 1, line 10.

17.  CASH REMAINING: Follow the process in Spreadsheet 1, No. 11.

If These Were Your Numbers, What’s a Founder to
Do?

On  the  surface,  this  looks  like  a  really  lovely  business.  It  plans  to  generate
$746,000  in  positive  cash  flow  in  its  first  year  of  customer  creation,  and  to
roughly triple that cashflow in its second year. But can a business doing $2.5-
million in revenue after four years really make investors and founders happy?
That’s not for us to decide, and the numbers don’t tell us whether they spent
$500,000 and a year—or $5,000,000 and five years—to get to the start of the
spreadsheet, so it’s hard to applaud or bash the outcome.

Seems  like  the  next  board  meeting  should  pull  out  the  latest  business
model canvas and look for some game-changing growth opportunities, almost
no matter what. The company isn’t spending all that much money on product
development or staff costs (those numbers are relatively flat), and it’s almost

turning into a cash cow long before it should be turned out to pasture.

After  all,  almost  any  business  that  can  get  almost  100,000  new
customers in a year should be trying to figure out how to either add a zero to
that number in a year or two, or at least double it, perhaps, in the second year.
The company’s year two plan seems unambitious at first glance, even though
the profits double.

Meanwhile, on the downside:

The  $4  incentive  (No.  7)  might  deliver  too  few  sales  and  need  to  be
beefed up, changing net revenues adversely

App-store  (No.12)  approval  process  could  delay  launch  in  the  biggest
channel, hurting revenues

More  staff  (No.  15)  might  be  needed  for  support,  channel  relations,  or
who-knows-what

Mobile  sales  direct  to  consumers  (No.  5)  could  be  a  total  flop,  hurting
that revenue

Even though the numbers look pretty good in the spreadsheet, hold the
high-fives and look at ways to improve them anyway. After all, they’re still
estimates based on customer validation proof—they’re not money in the bank
by  any  means.  Review  the  “what’s  a  founder  to  do”  section  under
Spreadsheet 1 to explore ways to reduce the cash burn where it makes sense.
Hold all these thoughts—and others—for the final section of this phase, the
pivot-or-proceed discussion.

“Metrics That Matter”: Multi-sided/Ad-Supported Model (Table 11.2)
Note: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that
follows.

Metrics that Matter: Example 2

A Multi-sided Market Example

Here’s a third way to look at a totally different business model for the exact
same  product,  XPensePro  software.  Let’s  explore  a  multi-sided  market,
where  the  product  is  identical  but  it’s  absolutely  free  to  users.  Advertisers
eager to reach businesspeople with active expense accounts will pay to reach
the  audience,  and  company  revenues  come  from  advertising  and  sales  of  e-
mail lists, the other “side” in this multi-sided market example.

A multi-sided market, where the product is
identical but it’s absolutely free to users.

In  this  scenario,  our  venture-backed  multi-sided  market  company  is
offering its products to users for free, provided that they agree to receive two
e-mails  per  week  from  advertisers.  The  product  is  a  digital  download,  but
considerable  resources  are  expended  selling  ads  to  the  other  side  of  the
market. (It’s interesting to note how dissimilar these metrics that matter are
when  compared  with  the  other  two  business  models.)  As  in  the  previous
example, several things are factored into the numbers above:

Our VC-backed example has a $10-million war chest

Product-development cost is heavy at first and then declines

Product costs are practically zero, since the “product” is a download.

Revenue  never  scales  dramatically,  since  the  market  type  is  “re-
segmenting/niche  market,”  but  the  year-to-year  revenue  increases  are
significant enough to promise downstream success

Much  of  the  cost  of  advertising  and  e-mail  sales  is  factored  into  the
revenue numbers, which are net of network or rep commission costs

 
It still costs real money to acquire users through PR, e-mail, and other
activities, even for a free product. As the company iterates and becomes
smarter, its acquisition cost declines in the second year

Metrics that Matter/Add It All Up

There  are  16  “metrics  that  matter”  in  this  spreadsheet  because  we  need  to
monitor  revenue  and  costs  on  both  sides  of  the  multi-sided  market.  (The
company  pivoted  and  eliminated  cash  sales  of  its  product  in  this  scenario.)
Following the left-hand column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of
each number as well as its source a little more closely:

1.   New activated users : How many people will download the free app and
begin actively using it. Active is defined as generating at least the average
number of page views (No. 4).

2.   New user acquisition cost @ $3: On average, the customer acquisition
costs to generate one active user (No. 1). Some will come virally for free,
others will cost $6 or more.

3.   Total active users: Average active monthly users during the quarter.

4.   Average page views per user per quarter: Actual user clicks on the site
will generate this number by dividing the number of active users (No. 3)
into  total  page  views  (No.  5).  This  is  an  important  measure  of  the
business health and growth.

5.      Total  page  views  per  quarter:  Multiply  the  total  users  (No.  3)  by  the
average  page  views  per  user  (No.  4)  to  begin  to  understand  available
advertising-sales opportunities for the period.

6.      Less  attrition:  Lots  of  users  abandon  things  they  download  but  don’t
have to pay for, so watching this number (generated by instrumentation)
is  important.  We’ve  defined  attrition  as  a  user  who  hasn’t  generated  a
page view a week for two consecutive months.

7.   TOTAL CPMs to sell: subtract attrition (No. 6) from total page views
(No. 5) and divide by 1,000 for the “salable CPMs” needed (ad sales are
based on cost per thousand, or CPM). The +/- 7% average gets worse in
year two as more competitors emerge.

8.      Average  CPM  x  4  ads/page:  Competitive  analysis  and  “buy-side”
customer  validation  research  will  determine  what  CPM  advertisers  are
willing  to  pay  to  reach  this  audience.  Assuming  four  ads  on  each  page,
multiply the average CPM by 4 to compute the average revenue per 1,000
pages viewed. In this example, we’ve already deducted the cost of sales,
whether  it’s  commissions  for  sales  reps  or  network  ad  sales.  The  CPM
increases (Q3-4) as the site gets more attractive to advertisers.

9.   TOTAL ADVERTISING REVENUE: multiply the number of M’s (No.
7)  or  total  CPMs  available  for  sale  by  the  4x  average  CPM  (No.  8)  to
compute  advertising  revenue.  The  figure  grows  dramatically  as  the
number of users and their site traffic rise.

The business model looks so strong and
compelling...

10.  E-mail-list rental revenue: An estimate based on competitive analysis
and  buy-side  customer  validation  research.  This  starts  out  small  and  at
very  low  rates  (per  thousand)  and,  both  CPM  and  volume  build  as  the
audience becomes large enough to be attractive to advertisers.

11.  TOTAL REVENUE: This ad-supported multi-sided marketer has only
two  sources  of  revenue.  Add  the  advertising  revenue  (No.  9)  to  the  e-
mail-list rental revenue (No. 10).

12.  (Less) user acquisition cost: Subtract the number from Line 2 here.

13.    (Less)  product/product-development  cost:  Computed  from  customer
validation  and  cost  structure  boxes  of  the  business  model.  While  this
declines  later  in  the  first  year  as  the  initial  product  matures,  the  budget
increases  in  the  second  year  to  add  features  that  will  help  the  company
continue attracting new customers.

14.    (Less)  current  operating  costs:  Compute  the  costs  of  turning  on  the

lights at the company every day, as the EZ Gardner example, line 9.

15.  CASH BURN per period: Subtract the three cost centers (Nos. 12, 13
and  14)  from  the  total  revenue  (No.  11)  to  compute  the  quarterly  cash
burn.

 
16.  Cash remaining/end of quarter: Subtract the cash burned (or collected)
during the quarter from the checkbook balance as of the first day of the
quarter  to  calculate  the  cash  remaining  at  quarter’s  end.  This  number
becomes attractive rather quickly in this model.

If These Were Your Numbers, What’s a founder to
do?

There’s an old rule in startups that a spreadsheet is worth 48.5x the paper it’s
printed  on.  But  if  this  spreadsheet  set  of  “metrics  that  matter,”  is  anywhere
close to accurate, our founders and investors at Expensereporter may indeed
have a homerun on their hands.

In this case, the business model looks so strong and compelling that the
founders have two clear priorities. Job #1 is to play strong defense, and make
certain  that  they  deliver  on  all  the  key  numbers  in  the  plan  (which,  as  you
recall, are already turned into immutable facts through two grueling stages of
Customer Development). That process starts with a step-by-step revalidation
of  every  single  number  on  the  page,  to  be  sure  there  are  no  mistakes.  Next
step: a detailed “worst case” analysis.

As  every  business  should,  the  founding  team  here  should  expand  this
one set of metrics into three: a worst case and a high case, on both sides of
the hypothetical set of metrics shown here. And since the business is totally
dependent on advertising revenue, they should quickly return to their channel
validation efforts and probe further to make sure they’re as valid as everyone
believes. They should also focus on reducing user attrition.

With all that accomplished, review the analyses from Spreadsheets 1 and
2 about reducing costs and optimizing activation and revenue. Then, just in
case, put a case of great French Champagne in the office fridge!

Some Final Thoughts About the Financial Model

Market Type Affects Revenue Streams. Each of the four market types has a
distinctive sales-growth curve shaped by the degree of difficulty involved in
transitioning  from  sales  to  the  earlyvangelists  to  sales  to  mainstream
customers. Obviously in new markets, it typically takes considerable time for
the  product  to  catch  on  beyond  earlyvangelists,  who  aren’t  typically  high-

volume mainstream buyers. So success with early sales doesn’t guarantee fast
revenue scaling.

The  sales-growth  curves  for  a  new  market  and  an  existing  market
graphically  illustrate  the  difference.  Even  after  finding  and  successfully
selling to earlyvangelists, the rate of sales differs in later years because of the
different adoption rates of mainstream customers.

Revenue Growth in New and Existing Markets (Figure 11.3)

Estimating  revenue  in  an  existing  market  is  relatively  simple:  Look  at
the  incumbents  and  calculate  the  increasing  percentage  of  market  share  the
startup will grab each year.

Estimating a new market’s size might seem impossible, since it doesn’t
exist yet. What to do? Estimate the opportunity based on proxies and adjacent
markets.  See  if  there  are  any  comparable  companies.  Have  others  grown  as
fast as the estimate? Why will this startup perform similarly?

Revenue Growth in a Resegmented Market (Figure 11.4)

The  sales  curve  in  a  re-segmented  market  is  somewhat  easier  to
estimate. It’s generally similar to that of a new market in that it takes time to
gather  a  head  of  steam.  There  are  three  steps  to  assessing  a  re-segmented
market:  assess  the  size  of  the  existing  market,  figure  out  how  large  your
startup’s “segment” is, and calculate the adoption rate, or the time it will take
for  that  segment  to  recognize  the  new  product  as  the  solution  of  choice.
Count only the segment that will switch, and beware of long-term contracts,
service  contracts,  and  “sunk  costs”  such  as  training  and  installation,  all  of
which are often “lock-ins” or hidden barriers to switching.

Revenue growth curves depend on Market Type!

Demand Curve Affects Revenue: The “demand curve” seeks the optimum
intersection between sales volume and net profit. For example, if a physical
product  is  most  efficiently  manufactured  in  lot  sizes  of  5,000,  can  that
inventory  be  sold  in  a  reasonable  time  when  current  unit  sales  are  50  a
month? A startup selling new electric cars for $29,000 will generate massive
demand.  But  if  they  cost  $45,000  to  manufacture,  the  company  will  go
bankrupt very quickly. Consider:

the actual price per unit, for multiples, and for subscriptions

how pricing can be used to attract more users

how  pricing  can  create  larger  or  more  frequent  purchases  by  the  same
user; volume discounts, free shipping, loyalty points and similar pricing

 
mechanisms  are  used  for  what’s  typically  called  “market  basket”
optimization

how pricing can be used to enhance profitability or volume

how  the  company  can  forward-price  the  product  to  intersect  the
economies-of-scale curve (as in, “If we could build 10,000 at a time, our
production cost drops 32 percent”)

When to Bring in the Accountants

Eventually,  prospective  investors,  banks,  and  others  will  want  to  see  the
traditional  P&L,  forecast,  and  more,  and  that’s  fine.  Once  the  metrics  that
matter are firmly understood to make sound business sense and are validated,
almost any finance type (or high school math student) can convert them into a
VC-ready multiyear P&L spreadsheet, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement
(the “usual stuff” everyone is accustomed to seeing) with ease.

On  rare  and  welcome  occasions,  metrics  that  matter  actually  don’t
matter  at  all.  If  customer  acquisition  and  activation  are  proceeding  at  warp
speed month after month or the economy is hot, investors may ignore most of
the other metrics, throw caution to the wind, and vote to scale the company
rapidly. This seldom happens, but we hope it happens to you. It can happen
more often in frothy vertical markets, as it did in social networking and other
multi-sided  markets  or  strong  IPO  markets,.  But  nine  times  out  of  10,  the
metrics that matter do matter quite a bit when it comes time to spend serious
investor dollars.

Adding it all up

This phase is a vital make-or-break analysis of how well the business model
should work. But remember that the numbers are still only educated guesses,
validated—we  hope—through  extensive  customer  discovery  and  validation
effort with scores if not hundreds of customers.

Pivot or Proceed: Re-Validate the Business Model

It’s  the  perfect  time  to  take  one  last  look  at  the  key  business  model
components, for several reasons. In a few days, a great deal will change if the
vote  is  “go  forward”  to  the  customer  creation  step.  Customer  creation  is  a
radically  different  stage  during  which  the  company  suddenly  shifts  from
“searching  for  a  business  model”  to  “executing  one.”  It’s  no  longer
celebrating  mistakes  and  wrong  turns.  It  shifts  full-throttle  into  “execute”
mode, with revenue targets and timetables to hit, product and plans to deliver,
and  more  granular  and  precise  accountability  to  investors  and  board
members.

The  company  is  about  to  spend  a  great  deal  of  money  far  faster,  and
irrevocably,  as  it  works  ambitiously  to  deliver  its  chosen  business  model.
With that comes the typical “career risk” for founders, which always prompts
investors to ask if the seemingly manic “founder type” should be replaced by
a “seasoned” leader with proven execution skills. Massive amounts of money
are  about  to  be  spent  on  a  single,  focused  bet  that  the  business  model,  as
developed, has a high likelihood of scaling to profit and success. Boards and
investors  are  suddenly  less  forgiving  and  typically  far  less  welcoming  of
reports like “That idea was wrong” and “That didn’t work as we hoped” than
they were during the earlier “search” phases.

Long  story  short,  it’s  time  to  revisit  the  core  business  model  elements

one last time.

Best Bets

You’re almost done. You’ve run the numbers in the last section and are still
feeling  like  your  business  is  a  winner.  But  have  you  picked  the  best  value
proposition?  Is  your  product  delivery  schedule  right?  Are  you  confident

you’ve gotten the optimum revenue model and costs? And have you missed
any best moves on the overall business model? Here are a few last things to
check.

Make Sure the Value Proposition is Right

After  going  through  the  “metrics  that  matter”  in  the  last  section,  are  you
absolutely convinced you have the right value proposition? You’re about to
live with it for awhile. If you don’t feel that it’s going to win the marketplace
now, it doesn’t get better over time. It may be time to reconfigure, repackage
or  unbundle  the  product.  This  requires  a  loop  all  the  way  back  to  customer
discovery.  Once  there,  use  the  core  technology  to  develop  another  product,
configuration,  distribution  method  or  price  and  then  modify  product
presentations  and  return  to  Phase  3  (product  presentation)  and  do  it  again.
Yes, it hurts, but it hurts far less than failure.

Make Sure the Product Delivery is Right

Even  with  selling  success,  check  the  product  delivery  timing  with  the
product-development  team.  Schedules  inevitably  change,  seldom  for  the
better.  Can  the  company  still  deliver  what  was  just  sold  and  do  so  as
promised,  or  was  the  sale  actually  vaporware?  If  vaporware,  at  best  the
company  secured  a  few  pilot  projects.  Continuing  to  sell  as  if  nothing  has
changed  is  a  bad  idea.  As  schedules  slip,  hard-won  earlyvangelists  weaken,
and  references  evaporate  quickly.  The  good  news  is,  if  this  happens  (it
happens often), the situation is still recoverable. There aren’t many people to
fire, and the burn rate is low. (As discussed earlier, it’s always important to
have  enough  cash  to  get  this  phase  wrong  at  least  once.)  The  solution  is  to
shut down any additional selling for a while, admit mistakes, and turn pilot
projects  into  something  useful—first  for  the  customer  and  then  as  a
marketable product.

Make Sure the Revenue is High and Costs are Low

There’s  nothing  worse  than  leaving  money  on  the  table  or  spending  more

than you needed to. The best way to answer these questions and more is to
“walk” slowly through the business model one more time.

Start  with  the  value  proposition.  Are  there  too  many  features  or  not
enough variety? Would a lower price sell far more units or sell the same
number  at  a  lower  acquisition  cost?  What  if  the  product  were  free,  or
free to those bringing three or five or 10 other customers along?

In the customer-relationships hypothesis, is there rock-solid confidence
in  the  plan,  or  might  a  freemium  or  multi-sided  alternative  deliver
bolder,  faster  growth?  Will  that  costly  AdWords  effort  deliver  the
planned result?

Can a different channel deliver fewer sales and more profit?

Will partners deliver the revenue growth you need and expect?

Are there higher level business model patterns you may have missed?

Make Sure Your Business Model is Right

Grab  a  fresh  business  model  canvas  and  a  pack  of  Post-it  notes.  Explore
alternatives seriously. The team is about to put a big pile of chips, probably
millions, on “red” or “black,” as in “pass” or “fail.” Is everyone confident the
choice is the right?

Changing direction at this juncture is a bold move indeed. It’s not what
the investors expected, especially after a long, grueling process of customer
discovery  and  validation.  Then  again,  bold  moves  are  the  work  of  great
entrepreneurs. And even though a pivot at this point leads to more customer
validation and more time, it’s far better to pivot now than to forge ahead at
full  speed  and  full  spend  if  it’s  possible  that  there’s  a  better  idea  out  there
somewhere.

Further validate the business model, not just looking for enhancements
in  revenue  opportunity  and  places  to  reduce  cost,  but  looking  for  “game
changers.”  Can  you  change  a  product  sold  by  features  into  a  branded-
experience  that  becomes  a  “got-to-have-it”  fashion?  Can  you  change  a
revenue  model  from  a  unit  sale  into  a  network  effects  model?  Look  for  the
non-obvious business patterns. Even if the team is certain the current model
is the best way forward, now’s the time to bring in your advisory board and

have them throw stones (painful as it is) at your canvas. Do they see a huge
move that you missed? No doubt the financial model review just completed
raised  at  least  a  handful  of  questions  and  perhaps  pointed  to  some
opportunities. Revisit the business model checklist questions. Are any of the
answers  different?  Does  the  team  want  to  have  more  money  in  the  bank  or
spend less? Where can savings be effected or additional dollars efficiently put
to good?

If the team has turned over every possibility in its review, looking both
at  radical  changes  and  modest  improvements  in  the  business  model,  and
confidence still carries the day, it’s time to move on to the ultimate question:
pivot or proceed?

The Toughest Startup Question: Pivot or Proceed?

This  is  the  moment  of  truth  when  the  team  and  the  investors  will  vote  on
whether to begin spending massive amounts of money to execute the business
model.  To  vote  honestly,  the  team  needs  to  take  a  hard,  honest  look  at  the
pivot-or-proceed analyses developed in this phase.

As  grueling  as  the  customer  validation  process  is,  it’s  quite  likely  that
the  company  will  require  another  turn  of  the  wheel  before  everyone  can
enthusiastically  vote  to  move  forward.  Don’t  despair—this  need  to  pivot
arises almost every time, and often calls for a return all the way to customer
discovery.

Hubris is the evil twin of a passionate entrepreneur.

The  alternative  is  even  more  painful.  In  the  past,  investors  magically
assumed  flawless  execution  and  fired  executives  who  failed.  It’s  time  to
reflect, thinking seriously about the company’s genuine chances for scalable,
profitable  success.  It’s  a  hard  decision,  particularly  for  self-confident
entrepreneurs  who  pride  themselves  on  their  tenacity,  and  problem-solving
abilities.  “I’m  an  entrepreneur.  I  make  things  happen  against  all  odds”  just
doesn’t  cut  it  when  staring  at  the  hard  facts  and  statistics.  Don’t  confuse
hubris with passion or facts.

Did  validation  really  convert  opinions  to  facts,  or  is  everyone  just
moving  the  goalposts  to  reach  customer  creation?  The  next  step  seriously
cranks  up  the  company’s  cash  burn  rate,  sharply  diminishing  if  not
extinguishing available cash or runway.

Did the product sell well and easily? Is it absolutely, unequivocally clear
that  when  more  money  is  spent  to  acquire  customers,  they’ll  arrive  at  a
steady,  predictable,  profitable  pace?  This  question  in  particular  probably
sends 90 percent of startups back into the depths of Customer Development

 
to refine and retest components of the business model.

If the “ramp” to more customers, revenue and profits isn’t proved to be
predictable  in  test  results,  it’s  also  a  reason  to  pivot.  Using  everything  you
learned in customer validation, go back to Phase 1 of this step (get ready to
sell) and try it again. Sorry. This isn’t easy to do.

If everything checks out (again, it seldom does the first time around), the
end  of  customer  validation  is  a  major  milestone.  Customer  problems  are
understood,  a  set  of  earlyvangelists  has  been  found,  and  the  company  has
delivered  a  product  its  customers  want  to  buy,  developed  a  repeatable  and
scalable  sales  process,  and  demonstrated  a  profitable  business  model.
Hopefully,  all  the  learning  is  captured  in  writing  and  the  business  model
diagram is updated. Fund-raising, while never easy, will be far easier than at
this point than it was before.

When  you’ve  answered  “yes”  to  that  taxing  list  of  questions,  you
deserve a night off, if not a week. Congratulations! The company is prepared
to move full speed ahead to the customer creation process.

 What’s Next?

The first two steps of Customer Development are where entrepreneurs live or
die  in  the  search  for  a  repeatable  and  scalable  business  model.  When  a
company  has  successfully  exited  Customer  Validation,  there’s  a  library  full
of business-building texts available to help execute the business model. So, at
least  for  now,  if  you’re  eager  to  execute  the  next  two  steps—Customer
Creation  and  Company  Building—return  to  the  original  Four  Steps  to  the
Epiphany, or turn to a more targeted text for fine-tuned support.

Whatever  you  do  next,  the  successful  completion  of  Customer
Validation  is  a  momentous  step  in  the  life  of  your  startup.  You  have
completed  an  arduous,  challenging  journey.  Our  warmest,  most  sincere
congratulations. We look forward to learning about your success!

How To Build a Web Startup –
Lean LaunchPad Edition

If you’re an experienced coder and user interface designer you think nothing
is easier than diving into Ruby on Rails, Node.js and Balsamiq and throwing
together a website. (Heck, in Silicon Valley even the waiters can do it.)

But for the rest of us mortals whose eyes glaze over at the buzzwords,
the  questions  are,  “How  do  I  get  my  great  idea  on  the  web?  What  are  the
steps in building a website?” And the most important question is, “How do I
use  the  business  model  canvas  and  Customer  Development  to  test  whether
this is a real business?”

My  first  attempt  at  helping  students  answer  these  questions  was  by
putting  together  the  Startup  Tools  Page  at  www.steveblank.com.  It’s  a
compilation of available tools for startups. While it was a handy reference, it
still didn’t help the novice.

So below, I offer my next attempt.

How To Build a Web Startup – The Lean LaunchPad Edition

Here’s  the  step-by-step  process  we  suggest  our  students  use  in  our  Lean
LaunchPad classes. All these steps are covered in Chapters 3,4 and 5.

1.  Set up the logistics to manage your team
2.  Craft company hypotheses
3.  Write a value proposition statement that other people understand
4.  Set up the Website Logistics
5.  Build a “low fidelity” web site
6.  Get customers to the site
7.  Add the backend code to make the site work
8.  Test the “problem” with customer data
9.  Test the “solution” by building the “high-fidelity” website
10.  Ask for money

(Use  the  Startup Tools  page  at  www.steveblank.com  as  a  resource  for

tool choices.)

The tools listed in these Steps are examples. They are not recommended
or preferred, just representative of what’s available. New tools appear
daily.  Do  your  homework.  See  www.steveblank.com  for  a  list  of  the
latest tools.

Step 1: Set Up Team Logistics

Read Chapter 1 - The Customer Development Manifesto
Set  up  a  WordPress  blog  to  document  your  Customer  Development
progress
Use Skype or Google+ Hangouts for team conversations

Step 2. Craft Your Company Hypotheses

Write down your 9-business model canvas hypothesis
List key features/Minimal Viable product plan
Size the market opportunity. Use  Google Trends, Google Insights,  and
Facebook ads to evaluate the market growth potential. Use Crunchbase
to look at competitors
Calculate Total Available Market, and customer value
Pick market type (existing, new, resegmented)
Prepare  weekly  progress  summary:  business  model  canvas  update  +
weekly Customer Development summary (described after Step 10)

Step 3: Write a Unique Selling Proposition statement that other people
understand

If you can’t easily explain why you exist, none of the subsequent steps
matter. A good format is “We help X do Y by doing Z”
Once  you  have  a  statement  in  that  format,  find  a  few  other  people

 
 
(doesn’t matter if they’re your target market) and ask them if it makes
sense
If not, give them a longer explanation and ask them to summarize that
back  to  you.  Other  people  are  often  better  than  you  at  crafting  an
understandable Unique Selling Proposition.

Step 4: Website Logistics

Get  a  domain  name  for  your  company.  To  find  an  available  domain
quickly, try Domize or Domainr
Then use godaddy or namecheap to register the name. (You may want to
register  many  different  domains  (different  possible  brand  names,  or
different misspellings and variations of a brand name)
Once you have a domain, set up Google Apps on that domain (for free!)
to host your company name, email, calendar, etc.

For coders: set up a web host

Use  virtual  private  servers  (VPS)  like  Slicehost  or  Linode  (cheapest
plans ~$20/month, and you can run multiple apps and websites)
You  can  install  Apache or Nginx  with  virtual  hosting,  and  run  several
sites  plus  other  various  tools  of  your  choice  (assuming  you  have  the
technical skills of course) like a MySQL database
If  you  are  actually  coding  a  real  app,  use  a  “Platform  As  A  Service”
(PAAS)  like  Heroku, DotCloud  or  Amazon  Web  Services  if  your  app
development stack fits their offerings

Customer Discovery for the Web

Step 5: Build a Low Fidelity Web Site

Depending on your product, this may be as simple as a splash page with:
your  value  proposition,  benefits  summary,  and  a  call-to-action  to  learn
more, answer a short survey, or pre-order)
For surveys and pre-order forms, Wufoo and Google Forms  can  easily
be embedded within your site with minimal coding

For non-coders:

Make a quick prototype in PowerPoint, or
Use Unbounce, Google Sites, Weebly, Godaddy, WordPress or Yola
For surveys and pre-order forms, Wufoo and Google Forms  can  easily
be embedded within your site with minimal coding

For coders: build the User Interface

Pick a website wireframe prototyping tool, (i.e. JustinMind, Balsamiq)
99 Designs is great to get “good enough” graphic design and web design
work  for  very  cheap  using  a  contest  format.  Themeforest  has  great
designs
Create wireframes and simulate your “Low Fidelity” website
Create  a  fake  sign  up/order  form  to  test  customer  commitment.
Alternatively,  create  a  “viral”  landing  page,  with  LaunchRock  or
KickoffLabs
Embed a slideshow on your site with Slideshare or embed a video/tour
using Youtube or Vimeo
Do user interface testing with Usertesting or Userfy

Step 6: Customer Engagement (drive traffic to your preliminary website)

Start showing the site to potential customers, testing customer segment
and value proposition
Use  Ads,  textlinks  or  Google  AdWords,  Facebook  ads  and  natural
search to drive people to your Minimally Viable web site
Use your network to find target customers – ask your contacts, “Do you
know someone with problem X? If so, can you forward this message on
to them?” and provide a 2-3 sentence description
For B2B products, Twitter, Quora, and industry mailing lists are a good
place  to  find  target  customers.  Don’t  spam  these  areas,  but  if  you’re
already an active participant you can sprinkle in some references to your
site or you can ask a contact who is already an active participant to do
outreach for you
Use  Mailchimp,  Postmark  or  Google  Groups  to  send  out  emails  and
create groups

Create online surveys with Wufoo or Zoomerang
Get  feedback  on  your  Minimum  Viable  Product  (MVP)  features  and
User Interface

Step 7: Build a more complete solution (Connect the User Interface to
code)

Connect the UI to a web application framework (for example, Node.js,
Rubyon Rails, Django, SproutCore, jQuery, Symfony, Sencha, etc.)

Step 8: Test the “Customer Problem” by collecting Customer Data

Use  Web Analytics  to  track  hits,  time  on  site,  source.  For  your  initial
site,  Google  Analytics  provides  adequate  information  with  the  fastest
setup.  Once  you’ve  moved  beyond  your  initial  MVP,  you’ll  want  to
consider  a  more  advanced  analytic  platform  (Kissmetrics,  Mixpanel,
Kontagent, etc.)
Create  an  account  to  measure  user  satisfaction  (GetSatisfaction,
UserVoice, etc.) from your product and get feedback and suggestions on
new features
Specific  questions,  such  as  “Is  there  anything  preventing  you  from
signing  up?”  or  “What  else  would  you  need  to  know  to  consider  this
solution?” tend to yield richer customer feedback than generic feedback
requests
If  possible,  collect  email  addresses  so  that  you  have  a  way  to  contact
individuals for more in-depth conversations

Step 9: Test the “Customer Solution” by building a full featured High
Fidelity version of your website

Update the website with information learned in Steps 5-8
Remember that “High Fidelity” still does not mean “complete product.”
You need to look professional and credible, while building the smallest
possible product in order to continue to validate
Keep collecting customer analytics
Hearing “This is great, but when are you going to add X?” is your goal!

Step 10: Ask for money

Put  a  “pre-order”  form  in  place  (collecting  billing  information)  even
before you’re ready to collect money or have a full product
When you’re ready to start charging – which is probably earlier than you
think  –  find  a  billing  provider  such  as  Recurly, Chargify,  or  PayPal to
collect fees and subscriptions

For all Steps:

Give your team a weekly Lessons Learned progress report.

     •  Start by putting up your business model canvas
     •  Changes from the prior week should be highlighted in red
     •  Lessons Learned. This informs the group of what you learned and

changed week by week – Slides should describe:
          1.  Here’s what we thought (going into the week)
          2.  Here’s what we found (Customer Discovery during the week)
          3.  Here’s what we’re going to do (for next week)
          4.  Emphasis should be on the discovery done for that weeks assigned

canvas component (channel, customer, revenue model) but
include other things you learned about the business model

How to Read This Book

CLEARLY, THE STARTUP OWNER’S MANUAL IS not a novel. This book is a step-
by-step  how-to  guide  that  details  a  process  for  building  a  successful,
profitable, scalable startup. It has more in common with a car repair manual
than it does with your favorite page-turner. Don’t attempt to read this book in
a single sitting or long weekend. It will be your companion—and, we hope,
your very best friend—for the six to 30 months or more that it often takes to
begin building a successful, scalable startup business.

Organization

This  book  is  organized  in  four  distinct  sections.  The  first,  Getting  Started,
describes  the  Customer  Development  methodology  and  ends  with  the
“Customer  Development  Manifesto,”  a  series  of  14  guiding  principles  for
startups deploying the Customer Development process.

Don’t read too much at a time.

The next section, Step One, “Customer Discovery,” turns the founders’
vision  into  a  business  model  canvas  and  then  into  a  series  of  hypotheses.
Those hypotheses are turned into experiments, and tested with customers to
see  if  your  understanding  of  the  customer  problem  and  proposed  solution
mesh.

Step  Two,  “Customer  Validation,”  expands  the  scope  of  the  business
model testing to see if you can get enough orders or users to prove that you
have a repeatable and scalable business model.

Interspersed throughout is a series of Checklists that help you track your
progress  at  every  stage  of  the  Customer  Development  process.  Use  the
checklists at the end of each step (yes, there’s one for each) to make sure you
have completed all the key tasks outlined in that step. Download them, share
them and circulate them to team members. But most important, use them to

 
be sure you have completed each step—before you move on to the next.

Paths Through This Book

     •   Read the glossary first. Customer Development has a language all its

own.

     •   Before you dive into the details, read the Customer Development

Manifesto.

     •   If you are familiar with Customer Development, start with Chapter 3,

“the business model hypotheses.”

     •   If you want to align co-founders, initial employees, investors and

advisors around the Customer Development philosophy, have them
read The Startup Owner’s Manual Strategy Edition.

     •   If you want a high-speed overview and little more, there are two

approaches:

          (a)  skim the checklists at the end of each step, which will give you a
sense of all the tasks you must complete to implement Customer
Development; or

          (b)  flip through the book, looking for “jumbo quotes” like this:

A Few Helpful Tips

Use the checklists. There is one for every step.

          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
Don’t  read  too  much  at  a  time.  This  is  a  reference  manual.  It’s
exhausting  when  read  as  a  book.  Take  “small  bites”  of  a  few  sections  at  a
time, at most.

Scan ahead.  It  gives  you  context  for  what  you  are  currently  doing.  If
you’re starting work on Chapter 3, for example, quickly scan Chapter 4 first
so you understand how what you’re doing now supports what comes next.

process, 

Entrepreneurship is not a cookbook or a checklist. At the end of the day,
founders  are  artists.  Don’t  expect  everything  to  work  like  the  book.  It’s
impossible for this book to address every entrepreneurial decision and every
type of startup. You’re outside the building not only looking for facts, but for
insight  and  inspiration.  Not  every  piece  of  advice  fits  every  situation  you’ll
encounter.  And  not  every  piece  of  advice  will  always  work.  That’s  what
entrepreneurs are for.

 
 
CHAPTER 1

The Customer Development Manifesto

BEFORE  DIVING  HEADFIRST  INTO  THE  DETAILS of the Customer Development
process,  it’s  crucial  to  review  the  14  rules  that  make  up  The  Customer
Development Manifesto. Embrace them. Review them regularly with the team
and (maybe after the IPO) consider perhaps even etching them in marble at
world headquarters.

Rule No. 1:

There Are No Facts Inside Your Building, So Get
Outside.

On  Day  One,  the  startup  is  a  faith-based  enterprise  built  on  its  founders’
vision  and  a  notable  absence  of  facts.  The  founders’  job  is  to  translate  this
vision and these hypotheses into facts. Facts live outside the building, where
future customers (prospects, really) live and work, so that’s where you need
to go. Nothing is more fundamental to Customer Development, and nothing
is harder to do. It’s much easier to write code, build hardware, have meetings
and write reports than it is to find and listen to potential customers. But that’s
what separates the winners from the losers.

Facts live outside the building, where future
customers live and work...

In  Customer  Development,  the  founders  gather  firsthand  experience
about  every  component  of  the  business  model.  The  team  can  support  the
founders,  but  firsthand  experience  by  definition  cannot  be  delegated.  This

 
customer research must be done by founders because:

Key  customer  feedback  points  are  random,  unpredictable,  and  often
painful to hear. Employees hate to deliver bad news to higher-ups

Employees have far less at stake and seldom listen as acutely, and they
don’t  get  heard  adequately  when  they  report  back.  It’s  too  easy  to
dismiss  their  findings  as  “hearsay”  or  to  ignore  critical  points  of
feedback

Consultants have even less at stake than employees and often color their
commentary  to  either  tell  the  client  what  he  wants  to  hear  or  deliver
messages that can lead to extended consulting relationships. This is also
second-  or  third-hand  feedback  and  too  diluted  or  diffused  to  provide
value

Only a founder can embrace the feedback, react to it, and adeptly make

the decisions necessary to change or pivot key business model components.

Rule No. 2:

Pair Customer Development with Agile
Development

Customer Development is useless unless the product
development organization can iterate the product
with speed and agility.

Customer  Development 
the  product  development
is  useless  unless 
organization  can  iterate  the  product  with  speed  and  agility.  If  Engineering
builds  the  product  using  waterfall  development,  it  will  be  deaf,  dumb  and
blind to customer input except during a short period when it’s specifying the
product.  The  rest  of  the  time,  engineers  are  locked  into  an  implementation
cycle,  unable  to  change  the  product  features  without  intolerable  delay.  By
contrast,  a  startup  engineering  organization  using  an  agile  methodology  is

 
designed to continually take customer input and deliver a product that iterates
readily around an MVP or its minimum feature set.

In  this  book,  agile  engineering/development  refers  to  the  rapid
deployment,  iterative  development  and  continuous  discovery  processes  that
hardware  or  software  companies  can  use.  We  don’t  advocate  any  particular
flavor,  just  its  necessity.  The  Customer  Development  process  provides  the
continuous customer input to make agile work.

Before the company even starts, the founders need to reach a deep and

inexorable commitment to the customer/agile development partnership.

Rule No. 3:

Failure is an Integral Part of the Search

One of the key differences between a startup and an existing company is the
one that’s never explicitly stated: “startups go from failure to failure.”

In  contrast,  existing  companies  have  learned  what  works  and  doesn’t.
Failures  in  an  existing  company  are  an  exception.  They  happen  when
someone  screws  up.  In  a  startup,  you’re  searching,  not  executing,  and  the
only way to find the right path is to try lots of experiments and take a lot of
wrong turns. Failure is part of the process.

If you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined
to do so.

Failures  are  not  truly  failures,  per  se  but  an  integral  part  of  the  startup
learning process. You’ll be running dozens if not hundreds of pass/fail tests
—on your pitch, your features, your pricing, and on and on—so get ready to
accept  failure  and  move  on.  When  something  isn’t  working,  successful
founders orient themselves to the new facts, decide what needs fixing, and act
decisively.

The  Customer  Development  process  demands  frequent,  agile  iteration,
followed,  of  course,  by  testing  of  the  iteration  that  often  leads  to  another
iteration or pivot, which leads to more testing and...

If you’re afraid to fail in a startup, you’re destined to do so.

 
Rule No. 4:

Make Continuous Iterations and Pivots

The  strategy  of  embracing  failure  in  Customer  Development  demands
frequent, agile iteration and pivots. A pivot is a substantive change in one or
more of the nine boxes of the business model canvas. (For example, a pricing
change  from  freemium  to  subscription  model  or  a  customer  segment  shift
from  boys  12-15  years  old  to  women  45-60.)  Or  it  can  be  more  complex,
such as a change of target customer or user. Iterations, meanwhile, are minor
changes  to  business  model  components  (e.g.,  changing  pricing  from  $99  to
$79).

Groupon’s legendary $12 billion pivot is a perfect
example.

When  a  company  is  limping  along,  only  a  dramatic  change  to  one  or
more  business  model  components  can  get  it  back  on  the  road  to  success.
Groupon’s  legendary  $12  billion  pivot  (their  IPO  valuation)  is  a  perfect
example.  Groupon  was  started  from  a  company  called  the  Point.  It  was
struggling, at best, as a social media platform working to get people together
to solve problems, but was about to run out of money.

The most effective campaigns on The Point were those that saved people
money  by  grouping  or  bundling  their  purchases.  The  founders  started
blogging various deals from different businesses each day. They called this,
“Get Your Groupon.com.” Groupon’s first offer hit in October of 2008: buy
two pizzas for the  price  of  one  in  the  shop  on  the  first  floor  of  its  Chicago
headquarters. Twenty  people bought the deal and the company was well on
its way to its $12-billion pivot.

Pivots are driven by the learnings and insight from a continuous stream

of “pass/fail” tests you run throughout discovery and validation.

The best startup founders don’t hesitate to make the change. They admit

when hypotheses are wrong and adapt.

Rule No. 5:

 
No Business Plan Survives First Contact with
Customers So Use a Business Model Canvas

financing, 

the  business  plan 

There’s  only  one  reason  for  a  business  plan:  some  investor  who  went  to
business school doesn’t know any better and wants to see one. But once it has
delivered 
fundamentally  useless.
Entrepreneurs often mistake their business plan as a cookbook for execution,
failing to recognize that it is only a collection of unproven assumptions. At its
back, a revenue plan blessed by an investor, and composed overwhelmingly
of  guesses,  suddenly  becomes  an  operating  plan  driving  hiring,  firing,  and
spending. Insanity.

is 

The difference between a static business plan and a
dynamic model could well be the difference between
flameout and success.

The  difference  between  a  static  business  plan  and  a  dynamic  business
model could well be the difference between a flameout and success. Startups
should dump the business plan and adopt the flexible business model.

A  business  model  describes  the  flow  between  key  components  of  the

company:

value proposition, which the company offers (product/service, benefits)

customer segments, such as users, and payers, or moms or teens

distribution  channels  to  reach  customers  and  offer  them  the  value
proposition

customer relationships to create demand

revenue streams generated by the value proposition(s)

resources needed to make the business model possible

activities necessary to implement the business model

partners who participate in the business and their motivations for doing
so

 
cost structure resulting from the business model

The business model canvas (see Figure 1.1) presents a visual overview
of  the  nine  components  of  a  business  on  one  page.  In  this  book,  Alexander
Osterwalder’s business model canvas serves as the scorecard for the customer
discovery process described in Step One. Osterwalder’s book Business Model
Generation (Wiley, 2010) provides the structure for the canvas.

Business Model Canvas (Figure 1.1)

As a startup moves through the Customer Development process, it will
use  the  business  model  canvas  as  a  scorecard,  by  posting  the  hypotheses

about each component of the model and then revising the hypotheses as the
founders  gather  facts.  Think  of  your  first  version  of  the  business  model
canvas as the starting point showing the hypotheses that must be confirmed in
face-to-face  or  online  interaction  with  customers.  More  often  than  not,  the
customers  will  reject  components  of  the  business  model,  saying,  “I’d  rather
buy that from a retailer,” or, “The product needs to have these features to be
important  to  me.”  As  customers  approve  or  dispute  the  business  model
hypotheses, the company either accepts the customers’ approval or pivots to
change its business model to better target the opportunity.

Using the business model canvas as a guide makes it easier to figure out
where and how to pivot, since the team can visually diagram its alternatives
and see what it needs to change. Each time the founders iterate or pivot (see
Rule  No.  4)  in  response  to  customer  feedback,  they  draw  a  new  canvas
showing the changes. Over time, these multiple canvases form a “flip book”
that  shows  the  evolution  of  the  business  model.  Agile  startups  can  end  up
with a six-inch-thick stack of business model diagrams they can burn at the
IPO-celebration bonfire.

Much more about how to use business model diagrams to “keep score”

throughout the customer discovery process can be found in Chapter 2.

...hypothesis is just a fancy word for “guess.”

Rule No. 6:

Design Experiments and Test to Validate Your
Hypotheses

Initially, hypothesis is just a fancy word for “guess.” To turn hypotheses into
facts,  founders  need  to  get  out  of  the  building  and  test  them  in  front  of
customers.  But  how  do  you  test?  And  what  do  you  want  to  learn  from  the
tests? Testing and learning require you to be thoughtful on constructing and
designing your tests. We call this “designing the experiments.”

Customer  Development  experiments  are  short,  simple,  objective
pass/fail  tests.  You’re  looking  for  a  strong  signal  in  the  signal/noise  noise

 
ratio, something like five of the first 12 customers you call on saying “I need
this right now, even if it’s still buggy.” Early tests aren’t necessarily precise,
but should give you a “good enough” signal to proceed.

The Customer Development Insight Cycle (Figure 1.2)

Start  by  asking  yourself,  “What  insight  do  I  need  to  move  forward?”
Then ask, “What’s the simplest test I can run to get it?” Finally, think about,
“How do I design an experiment to run this simple test?”

One  of  the  things  that  trips  up  engineering  founders  is  thinking  that

these tests have to be actual code, hardware or the real product. Most of the
time you can mock-up the web page or create a demo or physical prototype to
elicit valuable learning.

Rule No. 7:

Agree on Market Type. It Changes Everything

One of the radical insights guiding this book is that not all startups are alike.
One of the key ways in which they are different is in the relationship between
a  startup’s  new  product  and  its  market.  These  product/market  relationships
generally fit one of these descriptions:

bringing a new product into an existing market

bringing a new product into a new market

bringing a new product into an existing market and trying to:

re-segment that market as a low-cost entrant or

re-segment that market as a niche entrant

cloning a business model that’s successful in another country

What confused entrepreneurs for decades is that the traditional product
introduction model works when introducing a product into an existing market
with a known business model (i.e., known customers, channels and markets).
However,  since  the  majority  of  startups  are  not  pursuing  known  markets
(those in new or re-segmented categories), they don’t really know who their
customers will be. These types of startups are searching for a repeatable and
scalable business model.

Market type influences everything a company does.

Market type influences everything a company does. Strategy and tactics
that  work  for  one  market  type  seldom  work  for  another.  Market  type
determines  the  startup’s  customer  feedback  and  acquisition  activities  and
spending.  It  changes  customer  needs,  adoption  rates,  product  features  and

 
positioning  as  well  as  its  launch  strategies,  channels  and  activities.  In  sum,
different  market  types  require  dramatically  different  discovery,  MVPs,  and
sales and marketing strategies.

In  existing  markets,  where  customers  exist,  marketing  is  relatively  easy:
users can describe the market and the attributes that matter the most to them.
The  new  product  or  service  typically  runs  faster,  does  something  better  or
cheaper,  or  otherwise  improves  on  a  customer-defined  attribute.  Users,  the
market, and competitors are known, and competition involves comparing the
product and its features with others.

In a new market, a company lets customers do something they couldn’t do
before  by  creating  something  that  never  existed  before.  Or  it  dramatically
lowers costs to create a new class of users. By definition, new markets have
no customers yet, so there’s nobody to know what the product can do or why
they  should  buy.  This  makes  getting  feedback  and  creating  demand
particularly  challenging,  since  the  product  is  unknown  to  users  and  the
market is undefined and unknown, and costly to develop.

The  key  isn’t  competing,  but  instead  understanding  whether  a  large
customer  base  exists  and  whether  customers  can  be  persuaded  to  buy.  A
classic founder error in a new market is the “fast-burn” spending of sales and
marketing funds, a practice that may be appropriate when selling to existing
customers in a known market, but makes no sense in a new market. The new-
vs.-existing axis is at the core of the market-type definition.

Re-segmenting  an  existing  market  is  useful  when  the  incumbent  is  too
difficult  to  attack  head-on  (like  Amazon,  Facebook,  or  Microsoft).  A  re-
segmentation  strategy  is  based  on  the  startup’s  market  and  customer
knowledge,  ideally  identifying  a  market  opportunity  that  incumbents  are
missing, which usually takes one of two forms: a low-cost strategy or a niche
strategy.  (Unlike  differentiation,  segmentation  forges  a  distinct  spot  in
customers’ minds that is unique, valuable, and in demand.)

Low-cost  re-segmentation  is  just  what  it  sounds  like.  Are  there
customers at the low end of an existing market who will buy “good enough”
performance at a substantially lower price?

Niche  re-segmentation  looks  at  an  existing  market  and  asks  whether
some segment of this market would buy a new product designed to address
more  specific  needs.  Can  some  sizable  portion  of  the  market  be  convinced
that a characteristic of the new product is radical enough to change the rules

and  shape  of  an  existing  market.  See  Chan  Kim  and  Renee  Mauborgne’s
work on “Blue Ocean Strategy” for another way to think of re-segmenting a
market.

Cloning  an  existing  business  model  is  a  powerful  technique  when  an
existing  business  has  been  proven  in  one  country  but  has  not  yet  been
introduced in another. Startups in Russia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan and
China  (each  with  its  own  large  local  market  and  language  and  cultural
barriers)  can  adopt,  borrow,  or  copy  a  successful  American  business  model
and customize it for local language and buying preferences. (Soon ideas from
those countries will be cloned in the U.S.)

For example, Baidu in China and Yandex in Russia are the equivalent of
Google  in  their  respective  markets.  And  Qzone,  RenRen,  PengYou  and
Kaixin are the Facebooks of China, while Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki play
the same role in Russia.

Startup  companies  generally  enter  one  of  these  four  market  types  and
ultimately  must  commit  to  one.  The  consequences  of  a  wrong  market-type
choice will prove to be severe in the customer creation stage. While market
type is ultimately a “late-binding decision,” a working hypothesis helps frame
early customer discovery issues. Market-type decision-making is explored in
greater detail in Chapter 2.

...the few financial metrics to track: cash-burn rate,
number of months’ worth of cash left...

Rule No. 8:

Startup Metrics Differ from Those in Existing
Companies

We  now  have  several  centuries’  worth  of  performance  metrics  for  existing
businesses—P&Ls  balance  sheets,  cash-flow  forecasts  and  line-of-business
analyses,  plus  scores  of  others.  Here’s  hoping  your  startup  becomes  big
enough to need them someday. In the past (not so long ago), we used these

 
tools  with  startups  because  we  didn’t  know  what  else  to  measure.  We  now
know  that  startup  metrics  should  focus  on  tracking  the  startup’s  progress
converting  guesses  and  hypotheses  into  incontrovertible  facts  rather  than
measuring  the  execution  of  a  static  plan.  It’s  critical  that  board  and
management  continuously  test  and  measure  each  hypothesis  until  the  entire
business model is worth scaling into a company.

If the company is venture-backed, management and investors must agree
on a set of metrics that truly matter and work toward a report or “dashboard”
that  essentially  replaces  the  P&L,  cash  flow,  and  balance  sheet  as
centerpieces of early board meetings.
Startup metrics track the results of pass/fail tests and the iterations they lead
to:

Have the customer problem and product features been validated?

Does the minimum feature set resonate with customers?

Who  in  fact  is  the  customer,  and  have  initial  customer-related
hypotheses  on  the  likes  of  value  proposition,  customer  segments,  and
channels been validated through face-to-face customer interaction?

Customer-validation  questions  might  include:  average  order  size,
customer lifetime value, average time to first order, rate of sales pipeline
growth, improvement in close rate, and revenue per salesperson.

In  addition  to  the  startup  metrics  above,  the  relatively  few  financial
metrics that a startup board should be tracking are cash-burn rate, number of
months’ worth of cash left, short-term hiring plans, and amount of time until
the company reaches cash-flow break-even.

Make sure decisions are fact-based, not faith-based.

Rule No. 9:

Fast Decision-Making, Cycle Time, Speed and
Tempo

 
Speed  matters  at  startups  where  the  only  absolute  certainty  is  that  the  bank
balance declines every day. While Rule No. 4 addresses iterations and pivots,
it  doesn’t  specify  how  long  they  should  take.  Unequivocally,  the  faster  the
better,  since  the  faster  these  “learn,  build,  pivot”  or  “iterate,  build”  cycles
happen,  the  greater  the  odds  of  finding  a  scalable  business  model  with  the
cash  on  hand.  If  cycles  happen  too  slowly,  the  startup  runs  out  of  cash  and
dies.  The  biggest  impediment  to  cycle  time  is  psychological:  it  requires  the
admission of being wrong or even of suffering a short-term tactical defeat.

While pivots and iterations are about speed outside the building, speed
also matters inside the company. Most startup decisions are made in the face
of  uncertainty.  There’s  seldom  a  clear-cut,  perfect  solution  to  any
engineering,  customer  or  competitor  problem,  and  founders  shouldn’t
agonize  over  trying  to  find  one.  This  doesn’t  mean  gambling  with  the
company’s fortunes on a whim. It means adopting plans with an acceptable
degree  of  risk  and  doing  so  quickly.  (Make  sure  these  decisions  are  fact-
based, not faith-based.) In general, the company that consistently makes and
implements decisions rapidly gains a tremendous, often-decisive competitive
advantage.

...startups should make reversible decisions before
anyone leaves the CEO’s office.

Startup  decisions  have  two  states:  reversible  and  irreversible.  A
reversible  decision  could  be  adding  or  dropping  a  product  feature  or  a  new
algorithm in the code or targeting a specific set of customers. If the decision
proves  a  bad  one,  it  can  be  unwound  in  a  reasonable  period  of  time.  An
irreversible  decision  such  as  firing  an  employee,  launching  a  product,  or
signing  a  long  lease  on  expensive  office  space  is  usually  difficult  or
impossible to reverse.

Startups  should  as  policy,  make  reversible  decisions  before  anyone
leaves the CEO’s office or before a meeting ends. Perfect decision-making is
both  unimportant  and  impossible,  and  what  matters  more  is  forward
momentum  and  a  tight,  fact-based  feedback  loop  to  quickly  recognize  and
reverse bad decisions. By the time a big company gets the committee to get
the  subcommittee  to  pick  a  meeting  date,  most  startups  have  made  20
decisions, reversed five, and implemented the other 15.

 
Learning  to  make  decisions  quickly  is  just  part  of  the  equation.  Agile
startups  have  mastered  another  trick:  tempo—the  ability  to  make  quick
decisions consistently and at all levels in the company. Speed and tempo are
integral parts of startup DNA, and a great startup’s tempo is often 10 times
that of a large company.

Rule No. 10:

It’s All About Passion

A startup without driven, passionate people is dead the day it opens its doors.
“Startup people” are different. They think different. In contrast, most people
are great at execution. They work to live, do their jobs well, and enjoy their
family,  their  lives,  their  hobbies  and  often  even  enjoy  mowing  the  lawn.
They’re terrific at executing fixed tasks, and it’s a wonderful life for almost
everyone.

The  people  leading  almost  every  successful  startup  in  history  are  just
different.  They’re  a  very  tiny  percentage  of  the  world  population,  and  their
brains  are  wired  for  chaos,  uncertainty,  and  blinding  speed.  They’re
irrationally  focused  on  customer  needs  and  delivering  great  products.  Their
job  is  their  life.  It’s  not  9-to-5,  it’s  24/7.  These  are  the  people  who  found
high-growth, highly-successful scalable startups.

Startups demand execs who are comfortable with
uncertainty, chaos and change.

Rule No. 11:

Startup Job Titles Are Very Different from a Large
Company’s

In  an  existing  company,  job  titles  reflect  the  way  tasks  are  organized  to

 
execute a known business model. For example, the “Sales” title in an existing
company means there’s a sales team repeatedly selling a known product to a
well-understood group of customers, using a standard corporate presentation
with  an  existing  price  list  and  standard  terms,  conditions  and  contract.  The
“Sales” title in an existing company is all about execution around a series of
knowns.

Compared with big companies, startups need executives whose skills are
180  degrees  different.  Startups  demand  execs  who  are  comfortable  with
uncertainty,  chaos  and  change—with  presentations  and  offers  changing
daily,  with  the  product  changing  often,  with  probing  and  gaining  insights
from  failure  rather  than  high-fiving  a  success.  In  short,  they  need  the  rare
breed:

open to learning and discovery—highly curious, inquisitive, and creative

eager to search for a repeatable and scalable business model

agile enough to deal with daily change and operating “without a map”

readily able to wear multiple hats, often on the same day

comfortable celebrating failure when it leads to learning and iteration

We suggest replacing traditional execution-oriented sales, marketing and
business  development  titles  with  a  single  title:  the  Customer  Development
team. At first, this “team” will consist of the company’s founder(s), who talks
with  customers  to  gain  enough  insights  to  develop  the  minimum  viable
product. Later, as the startup moves into customer validation, the team may
grow  to  include  a  dedicated  “sales  closer”  responsible  for  the  logistics  of
getting  early  orders  signed.  The  closer  shouldn’t  be  confused  with  a
traditional sales VP. To succeed in this process, the team must have:

the ability to listen to customer objections and understand whether they
are issues about the product, the presentation, the pricing or something

Some would say this checklist isn’t bad for identifying great entrepreneurs.

Rule No. 12:

Preserve All Cash Until Needed. Then Spend.

The  goal  of  Customer  Development  is  not  to  avoid  spending  money  but  to
preserve  cash  while  searching  for  the  repeatable  and  scalable  business
model.  Once  found,  then  spend  like  there’s  no  tomorrow.  This  paragraph  is
worth deconstructing:

Preserve  cash:  When  a  startup  has  unlimited  cash  (Internet  bubbles,
frothy venture climate), it can iterate on its mistakes by burning more dollars.
When  money  is  tight,  without  dollars  to  redo  mistakes,  it’s  crucial  to
minimize  waste.  The  Customer  Development  process  preserves  cash  by  not
hiring  any  sales  and  marketing  staff  until  the  founders  turn  hypotheses  into
facts and discover a viable product/market fit.

While searching: Customer Development observes that at the start, the
company  and  its  business  model  are  based  solely  on  hypotheses,  not  facts,
and that the founders need to get out of the building to turn these hypotheses
into customer data. This “get out of the building” approach, combined with
rapid  iteration  and  pivots,  is  central  to  the  model’s  customer  discovery  and
validation steps.

...preserve cash while searching for the repeatable
and scalable business model...

Repeatable:  Startups  may  get  orders  that  stem  from  board  members’
customer relationships, engineering one-offs, or heroic single-shot efforts by
the CEO. These are great, but they aren’t repeatable by a sales organization.
Search  not  for  the  one-off  revenue  hits  but  rather  for  a  pattern  that  can  be
replicated  by  a  sales  organization  selling  off  a  price  list  or  by  customers
regularly visiting the website.

 
Scalable: The goal is not to get one customer but many—and for each
additional customer to add incremental revenue and profit. The test is: Does
the addition of one more salesperson or more marketing dollars bring in more
gross  profit  (or  users  or  clicks)  than  you  invested?  Who  influences  a  sale?
Who recommends a sale? Who is the decision-maker? Who is the economic
buyer?  Where’s  the  budget  for  purchasing  this  type  of  product?  What’s  the
customer acquisition cost? Affirming the repeatable, scalable sales model is
the  customer  validation  step  of  Customer  Development,  its  most  important
phase. Has the team learned how to sell a target customer? Can this happen
before the startup runs out of money?

Search not for the one-off revenue hits but rather
for a pattern...

Business model: A business model answers the basic questions of how
the company makes money. Is this a revenue play, or is it a freemium model
seeking users? Something else? Who’s the customer?

Spend like there’s no tomorrow: The goal of an investor-backed startup
is  not  to  build  a  lifestyle  business.  The  goal  is  to  reach  venture  scale  (10
times the return on investment or more). When management and board agree
that  they’ve  found  a  repeatable  and  scalable  sales  model  (i.e.,  have  a
product/market  fit),  then  invest  the  dollars  to  create  end-user  demand  and
drive those customers into the sales channel.

Rule No. 13:

Communicate and Share Learning

An  integral  part  of  Customer  Development’s  “learning  and  discovery”
philosophy  is  sharing  everything  that’s  learned  outside  the  building  with
employees, co-founders and even investors.

The traditional way to do this is via weekly company meetings to keep
employees  informed  and  board  meetings  to  let  the  investors  understand  the
progress  made  in  the  search  for  the  business  model.  But  technology  in  the
21st-century has taken us to places we never could get to before. We can now

 
communicate  all  we’re  learning  in  near-real  time  to  everyone  who  needs  to
know.

We  strongly  recommend  that  the  founders  keep  and  share  all  their
activities  in  the  customer  discovery  step  via  a  blog,  CRM  or  product
management tool. A powerful tool to help founding team members and their
investors and advisors communicate about progress in evolving their business
model  and  sharing  or  discussing  customer  discovery  has  been  developed  in
concert  with  the  authors  and  can  be  found  at  LaunchPadCentral.com.  It
records  hypotheses  the  startup  started  with,  who  the  team  has  talked  to,  the
questions asked, the tests conducted, what’s been learned, and questions for
advisors  or  investors.  While  this  may  seem  burdensome,  it  takes  less  time
than having a weekly coffee with an advisory board member. What results is
a communications tool allowing outsiders to view the company’s progress up
close and to offer suggestions and course corrections.

Rule No. 14:

Customer Development Success Begins With Buy-
In

Customer  Development’s  “learning  and  discovery”  philosophy  can  be
immensely disorienting to a founder, engineer or investor who has spent his
or  her  career  executing  a  plan.  For  Customer  Development  to  succeed,
everyone  on  the  team—from  investor  or  parent  company  to  engineers,
marketeers  and  founders—needs  to  understand  and  agree  that  the  Customer
Development process is different to its core. If the engineering VP is talking
waterfall  development  or  the  board  demands  a  rigid  timetable,  Customer
Development  is  destined  for  disaster.  Everyone  must  accept  the  process,
recognizing that this is a fluid, nonlinear search for a business model that can
sometimes last for years.

The Customer Development process is different to
its core.

Customer Development changes almost every aspect of startup behavior,

 
performance,  metrics,  and,  as  often  as  not,  success  potential.  It’s  not  just  a
“nice to do” while executing the revenue model in the back of the business
plan.  Customer  Development  reinvents  the  business  model  on  the  fly,
iterating  often  and  pivoting  whenever  indicated.  Founders  need  to  have  the
commitment  of  the  team  and  board  before  embarking  on  Customer
Development.  Ensure  that  all  understand  and  agree  that  it’s  iterative,
necessary,  and  worthwhile  and  that  it  changes  the  benchmarks  and  metrics
along the way.

Comments such as “The product is already spec’ed, and we can’t change
the  features  since  development  is  already  underway,”  or  “We  already  have
the  factory  (or  sales  team  or  marketing  materials)  built,”  or  “We  have  to
launch  to  make  the  numbers  in  the  plan,”  are  all  red  flags.  To  succeed  at
Customer  Development,  the  company  must  abandon  the  old  model’s
emphasis on execution of a fantasy business plan. Instead it must commit to a
Customer  Development  process  stressing  learning,  discovery,  failure,  and
iteration in the search for a successful business model. If you’re ready for this
process, this book will tell you how to do it.

Summary: The Customer Development
Process

The  Customer  Development  process  reflects  the  best  practices  of  winning
startups.  It  is  the  only  approach  for  web-based  businesses  where  failure  is
certain  without  constant  customer  feedback  and  product  iteration  as  they
search  for  their  audiences.  Customer  Development’s  fast  cycle  times  and
inherent  cash  conservation  gives  all  entrepreneurs  more  chances  to  pivot,
iterate, and succeed before the bank account runs dry. Describe this model to
entrepreneurs who have taken companies all the way to a lucrative exit and
beyond, and heads nod in recognition.

While each step has its own specific objectives, the process as a whole
has one overarching goal: discovering the repeatable, scalable, and ultimately
profitable business before running out of cash. This transforms the company
from a set of founding hypotheses into a moneymaking endeavor.

Customer Development is damn hard work. You
can’t fake it.

Customer Development is damn hard work. You can’t fake it. You can’t
just do the slides or “do” the process in a weekend. It’s a full-time, full-body-
contact sport. It’s a long-term commitment to changing the way a startup is
built. But it’s also proven to increase the chances of startup success.

An Introduction to Customer Discovery

No startup business plan survives first contact with customers.

—Steve Blank

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

—Lao Tzu

IRIDIUM  WAS  ONE  OF  THE  BIGGEST  STARTUP  gambles  ever  made—a  bold  and
audacious $5.2 billion bet. Founded by Motorola and a global partnership of
18  companies  in  1991,  Iridium  planned  to  build  a  mobile  telephone  system
that would work “anywhere on Earth,” from ships in the middle of the ocean
to  the  jungles  of  Africa  to  remote  mountain  peaks  where  no  cell  towers
existed.

How?  With  an  out-of-this-world  business  plan.  First,  the  company
bought  a  fleet  of  15  rockets  from  Russia,  the  U.S.  and  China.  Next,  it
launched an armada of 72 private satellites into orbit, where they acted like
500-mile-high  cell  towers  providing  phone  coverage  to  any  spot  on  Earth.
Seven  years  after  Iridium’s  founding,  its  satellites  were  in  place.  But  nine
months after the first call was made in 1998, the company was in Chapter 11
bankruptcy.  When  Iridium  crashed  back  to  Earth,  it  ranked  as  one  of  the
largest startup failures on record. What went wrong?

When Iridium was founded in 1991, worldwide cell-phone coverage was
sparse, unreliable and expensive. Cell-phone handsets were the size of lunch
boxes.  Iridium  put  together  a  business  plan  that  made  assumptions  about
customers,  their  problems  and  the  product  needed  to  solve  those  problems.
Other  assumptions  about  sales  channel,  partnerships,  and  revenue  model  all
added  up  to  a  set  of  financial  forecasts  that  Iridium  would  soon  be  printing
money.

One of the largest startup failures on record as they
executed their business plan.

But in the seven-plus years it took Iridium to go from concept to launch,
innovation in mobile- and cell-phone networks moved at blinding speed. By
the  time  Iridium  launched,  there  were  far  fewer  places  on  the  planet  where
cell-phone  service  was  unavailable.  Traditional  cell-phone  companies
provided  coverage  in  the  most  valuable  parts  of  the  world.  Prices  for  cell
service  shrunk  as  fast  as  phone  handsets  did.  In  contrast,  Iridium’s  satellite
phone was bigger than a brick and weighed about as much. Worse, Iridium’s
cell phone couldn’t make calls from cars or buildings, since it required line-
of-sight  “connection”  to  the  satellites.  Instead  of  50  cents  per  minute  for  a
regular cell call, Iridium’s calls cost $7 a minute, plus $3,000 for the handset
itself.

Iridium’s potential market shrunk nearly every day. Instead of a massive
worldwide market of potential users, it had drawn only a small group willing
to  pay  its  prices  and  put  up  with  the  product’s  many  limitations.  But
Iridium’s business model assumptions and plans were firmly fixed as if it was
still 1991. The company spent $5 billion building a business over eight years
without ever focusing on four key questions:

Have we identified a problem a customer wants to see solved?

Does our product solve this customer problem or need?

If so, do we have a viable and profitable business model?

Have we learned enough to go out and sell?

Answering  these  questions  is  the  purpose  of  the  first  step  in  the

customer discovery process. This chapter explains how to go about it.

(Twenty  years  later,  Iridium  emerged  from  bankruptcy.  In  2000,  an
investor group bought $6 billion worth of its assets for $25 million. After a
long climb back, the company celebrated its 500,000th customer in September
2011.)

Customers don’t behave like your business plan.

 
 
The Customer Discovery Philosophy

A startup begins with the vision of its founders: a vision of a new product or
service that solves a customer’s problems or needs and of how it will reach
its many customers. Customer discovery lowers the odds of spending zillions
and  getting  zeros  in  return  as  the  Iridium  team  did.  So  the  No.  1  goal  of
customer discovery amounts to this: turning the founders’ initial hypotheses
about their market and customers into facts.

Get Out of the Building

Facts  exist  only  outside  the  building,  where  customers  live,  so  the  most
important aspect of customer discovery is getting out of the building, in front
of customers. And not for a few days or a week, but repeatedly, over weeks if
not months. This critical task can’t be assigned to junior staffers and must be
driven  by  founders.  Only  after  the  founders  have  performed  this  step  will
they know whether they have a valid vision or just a hallucination.

Sounds  simple,  doesn’t  it?  But  for  anyone  who  has  worked  in
established companies, the customer discovery process is disorienting. All the
rules  about  new-product  management  in  large  companies  are  turned  upside
down. It’s instructive to enumerate all things you are not going to do:

understand the needs and wants of all customers

make  a  list  of  all  the  features  customers  want  before  they  buy  your
product

hand  Product  Development  a  features  list  of  the  sum  of  all  customer
requests

hand Product Development a detailed marketing-requirements document

run focus groups and test customers’ reactions to your product to see if
they will buy

What you are going to do is develop your product for the few, not the
many. Moreover, you’re going to start building your product even before you
know whether you have any customers for it.

On a startups first day, there’s limited—if any—
customer input.

For  an  experienced  marketing  or  product  management  executive,  these
ideas are not only disorienting and counterintuitive but heretical. Why aren’t
the  needs  of  all  potential  customers  important?  What  is  it  about  a  first
product  from  a  new  company  that’s  different  from  follow-on  products  in  a
large  company?  What  is  it  about  a  startup’s  first  customers  that  make  the
rules so different?

Search for the Problem/Solution Fit

The customer discovery process searches for problem/solution fit: “have we
found a problem lots of people want us to solve (or a need they want us to
fill)”  and  “does  our  solution  (a  product,  a  website,  or  an  app)  solve  the
problem in a compelling way?” At its core, the essence of customer discovery
is  to  determine  whether  your  startup’s  value  proposition  matches  the
customer segment it plans to target.

Problem/solution  fit  is  virtually  identical  to  what’s  sometimes  called
“product/ market fit,” as the previous paragraph indicates. As a result, we use
the  terms  somewhat  interchangeably  throughout  the  book.  Do  realize,
however,  that  in  multi-sided  markets,  there  may  be  multiple  value
propositions  and  multiple  customer  segments.  But  problem/solution  fit  is
only  achieved  when  the  revenue  model,  pricing,  and  customer  acquisition
efforts all match up with the customers’ needs.

Develop the Product for the Few, Not the Many

In  existing  companies,  the  goal  of  traditional  product  management  and
marketing  is  to  develop  a  market-requirements  document  (MRD)  for
engineering  that  contains  the  sum  of  all  possible  customer  feature  requests,
prioritized in a collaborative effort among Product Management, Marketing,
Sales,  and  Engineering.  Marketing  or  Product  Management  hosts  focus
groups,  analyzes  sales  data  from  the  field,  and  looks  at  customer  feature
requests  and  complaints.  This  information  leads  to  the  adding  of  requested

 
features  to  the  product  specification,  and  the  engineering  team  builds  them
into the next product release.

While  this  process  is  rational  for  an  established  company  entering  an
existing market, it’s folly for startups. Why? Startups aren’t small versions of
large,  existing  companies  where  there’s  plenty  of  customer  knowledge  and
input.  In  established  companies,  the  MRD  process  ensures  that  engineering
will  build  a  product  that  appeals  to  existing  customers  in  a  known  market,
where customers and their needs are known. On a startup’s first day, there’s
limited—if any—customer input for creating a formal product specification.

In  a  startup,  the  first  product  is  not  designed  to  satisfy  a  mainstream
customer.  No  startup  can  afford  to  build  a  product  with  every  feature  a
mainstream customer needs all at once. The product would take years to get
to market and be obsolete by the time it arrived. Instead, successful startups
solve this conundrum by focusing development and early selling efforts on a
very  small  group  of  early  customers  who  have  bought  into  the  startup’s
vision.  These  visionary  customers  will  give  the  company  the  feedback
necessary to add features to the product over time.

Earlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith
and buy an early product.

Earlyvangelists: The Most Important Customers of
All

Enthusiasts who spread the good news about your product to friends, family
or  co-workers  are  often  called  evangelists.  But  a  new  word  is  needed  to
describe  the  early  adopters—the  visionary  customers—who  buy  unfinished
and untested products, because they want to “first,” whether it’s for the sake
of gaining a competitive edge or winning bragging rights. We call these early
adopters earlyvangelists. Unlike “mainstream” business or consumer-product
customers  who  want  to  buy  a  finished,  completed,  tested  product,
earlyvangelists are willing to make a leap of faith and buy an early product
from a startup. Every industry has a small subset of visionaries willing to take
a leap of faith on an early product.

 
One  of  the  mistakes  that  startup  founders  make  is  to  give  away  or
heavily discount early alpha/beta products to blue-chip customers. In single-
sided markets (where the user is the payer) earlyvangelists will be happy to
pay for early access to the product. If they won’t, they aren’t earlyvangelists.
Their willingness to pay is a critical part of the customer discovery process.
You’ll use it to test the entire buying process.

Earlyvangelist Characteristics (Figure 2.1)

Earlyvangelists are willing or eager accelerators of
your viral growth.

In both physical and web/mobile channels, earlyvangelists display these

common characteristics (see Figure 2.1):

They have a problem or need.

They understand they have a problem.

They’re  actively  searching  for  a  solution  and  have  a  timetable  for
finding it.

The  problem  is  so  painful  that  they’ve  cobbled  together  an  interim
solution.

They’ve committed, or can quickly acquire, budget dollars to purchase.

Think of earlyvangelists’ characteristics along a scale of customer pain.
Earlyvangelist  customers  will  be  found  only  at  the  top  of  the  scale—those
who  have  already  been  looking  for  a  solution,  built  a  home-grown  solution
(whether in a company by building a software solution or at home by taping
together a fork, a light bulb and a vacuum cleaner) and have or can acquire a
budget.  These  people  are  perfect  earlyvangelist  candidates.  They  can  be
relied  on  for  feedback  and  initial  sales;  they’ll  tell  others  about  the  product
and spread the word that the vision is real. Moreover, they can be potential
advisory board candidates (more about advisory boards in Chapter 5).

Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) First

The idea that a startup builds its product for a small group of initial customers
rather  than  devising  a  generic  mainstream  spec  is  radical.  What  follows  is
equally revolutionary.

The goal of the MVP is to build the smallest possible

 
feature set.

On the day the company starts, there is very limited customer input. All
the startup has is a vision of what the problem, product and solution seem to
be. Unfortunately, it’s either a vision or a hallucination. The company doesn’t
know who its initial customers are or what features they’ll want. One option
is to start developing an entire full-featured first release of the product, with
every feature the founders can think of. We now know this results in wasted
engineering effort, time and cash, as customers don’t use, want or need most
of the features developed without their input.

Another path is to put Product Development on hold until the Customer
Development  team  can  find  customers  who  can  provide  adequate  feedback.
The risk here is lost time and no product for customers to provide feedback
against. A third, more productive approach is to develop the core features of
the  product  (incrementally  and  iteratively  with  agile  engineering  methods),
with  the  feature  list  driven  by  the  vision  and  experience  of  the  company’s
founders. This is a minimum viable product.

The  goal  of  customer  discovery  is  to  test  your  understanding  of  the
customer’s problem and see if your proposed solution will prompt him to use
or  buy  the  product  based  on  its  most  important  features  alone.  Most  users
want finished products, but earlyvangelists are the perfect target for the MVP.
Tailor the initial product release to satisfy their needs. If no one thinks your
MVP  solution  is  interesting  or  sufficient,  iterate  or  pivot  until  an  adequate
number say “yes.”

The shift in thinking to an incremental and iterative MVP as opposed to
a  fully  featured  first  product  release  is  important.  Engineers  tend  to  make  a
product  bigger  and  more  perfect.  The  MVP  helps  them  focus  the  most
important and indispensable features. Your goal in having an MVP is not to
gather feature requests to change the product or to make the feature set larger.
Instead, the goal is to put the MVP in front of customers to find out whether
you understood the customer problem well enough to define key elements of
the  solution.  Then  you  iteratively  refine  the  solution.  If,  and  only  if,  no
customers  can  be  found  for  the  most  important  features  of  the  MVP,  bring
customers’  additional  feature  requests  to  the  product  development  team.  In
the  Customer  Development  model,  feature  requests  to  an  MVP  are  by
exception and iteration rather than by rule. This eliminates the endless list of
feature  requests  that  often  delay  first  customer  ship  and  drive  product

 
development teams crazy.

Use the Business Model Canvas as The Customer
Discovery Scorecard

Often  there’s  a  lack  of  a  shared  and  clear  understanding  of  the  business
model throughout the company. This customer discovery step uses Alexander
Osterwalder’s  business  model  canvas  to  diagrammatically  illustrate  how  a
company  intends  to  make  money.  As  shown  in  Figure  2.2  the  canvas
represents any company in nine boxes, depicting the details of a company’s
product,  customers,  channels,  demand  creation,  revenue  models,  partners,
resources,  activities  and  cost  structure.  (We  described  the  business  model
canvas in detail in the Customer Development Manifesto.)

Business Model Canvas (Figure 2.2)

In this phase you’ll develop a one- or two-page brief about each of the

following boxes in the business model canvas:

Market Size: how big the opportunity is

Value Proposition, Part 1: the product/service, its benefits and minimum
viable product

Customer  Segments:  who  the  customer  is  and  what  problems  the
product solves

Channels: how the product will be distributed and sold

Customer Relationships: how demand will be created

Value  Proposition,  Part  2:  market-type  hypothesis  and  competitive  set/
differentiation

Key  Resources:  suppliers,  commodities,  or  other  essential  elements  of
the business

Key Partners: other enterprises essential to success of the business

Revenue Streams: revenue and profit sources and size

When  you  first  draft  your  initial  hypotheses  your  canvas  begins  to  fill

up, looking like Figure 2.3.

Sample Business Model Canvas—Initial Hypotheses (Figure 2.3)

But in addition to using the business model canvas as a static snapshot

of  the  business  at  a  single  moment,  frozen  in  time,  Customer  Development
uses the canvas as a “scorecard” to track progress in searching for a business
model.

Once  a  week  update  the  canvas  to  reflect  any  pivots  or  iterations,

highlighting in red the changes from the last week.

Then  after  you  and  your  team  agree  on  the  changes  to  your  business
model, integrate them into what becomes your new canvas for the week (the
accepted changes in red are then shown in black). During the next week any
new changes are again shown in red. Then the process repeats each week –
new changes showing up in red. Then a new canvas used for the week.

This  method  highlights  the  changes  over  time  for  your  and  the  team’s

reference. Figure 2.4 shows how the canvases will look over time.

Using the Business Model Canvas as a Weekly Scorecard (Figure 2.4)

Had  they  read  this  book,  and  gotten  out  of  the  building,  the  folks  at
Iridium might have saved billions by learning just how small the market for
their  business  had  become.  It  would  have  allowed  them  to  search  for
alternatives and survival.

there’s
To  sum  up  the  customer  discovery  philosophy:  whether 
product/market fit by finding earlyvangelists, understanding their needs, and
verifying  that  the  initial  minimum  viable  product  solves  a  problem  they’ll
eagerly  pay  to  have  solved.  And  if  not,  use  near-continuous  customer
feedback  to  drive  agile,  frequent  changes  in  product  and  business  model
alike.

As  you  complete  the  hypothesis  development,  your  business  model
canvas quickly becomes multi-dimensional. You are really developing three
initial canvases:

Core elements of the business model itself (value proposition, channel,
etc.)

Hypotheses  you  have  for  each  element  of  the  business  model  (such  as
“people  will  want  these  features,  “or  “customers  will  buy  our  product
because...”)

And a layer outlining the key pass/fail tests you will use to get face-to-
face with customers and use their feedback to convert your hypotheses
into facts.

Overview of Customer Discovery

Customer Discovery: Overview of the Process (Figure 2.5)

Customer Discovery has Four Phases

Phase 1 deconstructs the founders’ vision into the nine parts of the business
model  canvas  (product,  customers,  channels,  demand  creation,  revenue
models,  partners,  resources,  activities  and  cost  structure).  Then  your  team
writes  one-page  briefs  about  each  of  the  hypotheses,  including  the  list  of
experiments or tests you’ll need to conduct to prove or disprove each one.

In Phase 2 you conduct experiments to test your “problem” hypotheses. This
helps  you  understand  how  important  the  problem  is  and  how  big  it  can
become. You do so by testing most elements of the business model, including
the value proposition, pricing, channel strategy, and sales process. Your goal
is to turn hypotheses into facts or discard them if they’re wrong, and replace
them with new hypotheses. In the process, you’ll gain a deep understanding
of customers’ business, workflow, organization, and product needs. When all
the facts are in, update your results on the canvas.

In  Phase  3,  you  test  your  “solution,”  presenting  your  value  proposition
(product,  pricing,  features,  and  other  business  model  components)  and  the
minimum  viable  product  to  customers  and  compare  their  responses  to  the
“pass/fail” goals you developed earlier. The goal is not to sell the product, but
to validate how well you understood the problem in Phase 2 when you heard
customers  say,  “Even  these  minimum  features  solve  our  problems,”  or,  “I
need this product.” Ideally, customers ask, “When can I get it?”

In  Phase  4  you  stop  and  assess  the  results  of  the  experiments  you’ve
conducted and verify that you have:

a full understanding of customers’ problems, passions, or needs

confirmed the value proposition solves problems, passions or needs

determined that a sizable volume of customers exists for the product

learned what customers will pay for the product

made certain the resulting revenue should deliver a profitable business

With  your  product  features  and  business  model  validated,  decide

whether  you  have  learned  enough  to  go  out  and  try  to  sell  a  select  your
product  to  a  few  visionary  customers,  or  whether  you  need  to  go  back  to
customers to learn some more. If, and only if, you are successful in this step
do you proceed to customer validation.

That’s  customer  discovery  in  a  nutshell.  The  remainder  of  this  section

details each of the phases just described.

Now let’s get started.

CHAPTER 3

Customer Discovery, Phase One: State
Your Business Model Hypotheses

THE  DIAGRAM  ABOVE  IS  AN  OVERVIEW  OF  PHASE  1  of  customer  discovery.
Note  that  hypotheses  for  physical  products  often  differ  from  web/mobile
products.  Where  the  hypothesis  issues  differ,  each  is  described  separately,
physical  startups  in  the  upper,  lighter-tinted  row  and  web/mobile  startup
considerations in the lower, darker row.

This phase starts by developing a rough market size estimate to size the
opportunity for your new venture. Next, the rest of customer discovery uses
the  business  model  canvas  to  record  short  summaries  (hypothesis briefs)  of
initial hypotheses about your business. The canvas provides a picture of the
business  model  on  a  single  page,  serving  as  a  reference  for  team  members
and  a  scorecard  keeping  track  of  pivots  and  iterations  as  the  company’s
business model changes.

The  hypothesis  briefs  provide  the  detail,  but  remain  short  and  to  the
point,  with  enough  clarity  to  ensure  that  all  team  members  understand  their
meaning. No hypothesis brief should be more than two pages, and as a rule,
bullet points are far more helpful than paragraphs or even sentences. Almost
every hypothesis concludes with the experiments you’ll use in phases 2 and
3, when you’re out of the building talking to customers to prove or disprove
the hypothesis. Sometimes you’ll even need to get out of the building to do
some research just to figure out what tests to conduct and the kinds of results
to shoot for.

Initially, some briefs may seem shockingly empty. Not to worry—these
briefs  serve  as  an  outline.  The  team  will  return  to  them  often,  filling  in  the
blanks  and  modifying  original  hypotheses  with  new  facts  learned  along  the
way.

Market Size Hypothesis

This  brief  is  an  outlier—it  doesn’t  directly  map  onto  the  business  model
canvas.  But  because  there’s  nothing  worse  than  spending  years  in  a  startup
only to discover that it can never grow to more than a few million dollars in
revenue,  the  market  size  hypotheses  help  you  size  the  opportunity  of  your
startup  market.  Estimating  market  size  helps  determine  whether  the  payoff
from your new venture is worth the toil, sweat and tears, or whether you’re
about to do your first pivot.

Aligning  investor  and  founder  objectives  clearly  at  the  outset  is  good
“life insurance” for founders, since few disconnects cost founders their jobs
more quickly than disputes over goals and gold.

...few disconnects cost founders their jobs more
quickly than disputes over goals and gold.

The  thinking  applies  regardless  of  whether  it’s  in  the  physical  or
web/mobile channel. With one exception: buyable startups founded for a fast
sale  to  a  larger-platform  player  like  Facebook  or  Google.  Buyable  startups
should consider the size of what ís often a microsegment of a large market.

Market opportunities are fueled by three ingredients: a large number of
potential active users or customers, clear future-user growth in a market with
rapid and predictable growth, and the opportunity to attract active customers
or users.

TAM, SAM and Target Market

Marketers and their investors typically think of market size as three numbers;
TAM  (total  addressable  market),  SAM  (served  available  market)  and  target
market. The TAM for makers of a new smartphone app might be the 1 billion

 
total smartphone owners worldwide, but if the application is available only in
English or works only on an iPhone, the SAM or potential market served is
far smaller. And the target market might be Apple App Store customers, so
your next step would be to estimate what percentage of those shoppers might
actually buy. Each estimate further narrows the target market.

TAM = how big is the universe
SAM = how many can I reach with my sales channel
Target Market (for a startup) = who will be the most likely buyers

TAM, SAM and Target Market (Figure 3.1)

Estimating TAM and SAM and target market is a good starting point for
the  market  size  hypothesis.  Customers  will  help  turn  these  hypotheses  into
facts.

A top-down estimate is a first step. Use industry-analyst reports, market-
research  reports,  competitors’  press  releases,  university  libraries—and
discussions  with  investors  and  customers  to  “size”  the  overall  market.  Use
whatever  metric  is  most  appropriate—units,  dollars,  page  views,  eyeballs,
whatever.

A  note  of  caution:  First-time  entrepreneurs  are  seduced  by  market  size
data  from  research  firms.  They  should  keep  in  mind  that  market  research
firms are excellent at predicting the past. (If they were geniuses at predicting
the future, they’d be running hedge funds.)

Therefore,  a  bottom-up  estimate  is  usually  more  realistic  for  startups.
Toy makers, for example do this quite easily: there are roughly 2 million girls
born in the U.S. each year, and half can’t afford a $90 doll, so the U.S. target
market for a new doll for girls age 6 to 8 is at most 3 million.

Market research firms are great at predicting the
past.

In assessing an existing or re-segmented market, be sure to consider the
adjacent markets that customers might switch from. Millions of BlackBerry
users traded in their RIM devices when Apple’s iPhone arrived, for example.
Will  the  startup’s  new  product  have  the  competitive  power  to  encourage
switching?  Count  only  the  switchable  subset  and  beware  of  long-term
contracts, service contracts, and “sunk costs” like training or installation, all
of which are often hidden barriers to switching.

Of  course,  nobody  can  compute  a  new  market’s  size  today,  since  it
doesn’t exist yet. What to do? Estimate the opportunity based on proxies and
adjacent  markets.  See  if  there  are  any  comparable  companies.  Have  others
grown as fast as the estimate? Why will this startup perform similarly?

Value Proposition Hypothesis (Part 1)

Start  this  step  by  filling  out  your  canvas  with  the  value  proposition
hypothesis: the product or service being offered to customers. You’ll include
details about the product, its features and benefits, as well as the company’s
long-term product vision and its initial minimum viable product. Think of the
value  proposition  as  a  contract  between  the  customer  and  your  company
where the customer “hires” your startup to solve a problem.

Write  a  series  of  briefs  that  capture  the  founders’  hours  of  thinking,
talking, and brainstorming about the product in three separate, specific areas:

Product Vision

Product Features & Benefits

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The product development team produces much of the product brief, one
of the few times it’s asked to engage in a paper exercise. They put key value
proposition hypotheses down on paper and turn them into briefs agreed to by
all executives..

Product Vision

This portion of the value proposition brief captures your vision for what you
want your successful company to become.

Over time, successful companies are usually more than a single product.
What’s  your  long-term  vision  for  your  company?  What  do  you  want  to
ultimately change? Are you going to do it with a series of products? How do
you  expand  into  adjacent  markets?  How  do  you  get  people  to  change

behavior?  What’s  the  world  look  like  three  years  after  you  arrive  on  the
scene? Five years after?

Shape a long-term vision with a short narrative told in bullet points. For
example in the 1990s, a financial software company might have described its
user story this way:

Consumers hate to reconcile their checkbooks

We  think  we  can  develop  a  computer  program  that  emulates  a
checkbook.

It will automate all the hard and tedious parts of home banking

Consumers can use it to pay bills by connecting to the Internet

Millions of people will start using home computers to do something they
never did before

Today small businesses use bookkeepers to keep their books

After we succeed in automating consumers we will expand into financial
software for small businesses

Millions of small businesses will start using computers to do something
they never did before

Suddenly, the company vision is clear with a few simple bullet points.
The vision is critical because the Customer Development team has to paint a
picture  for  earlyvangelists  of  what  the  product  will  look  like  a  year  or  two
into the future.

Only because earlyvangelists are buying into your
total vision will they spend money for an
incomplete, buggy, barely functional first product.

In the long-term vision, the product team specifies the delivery date for
the  MVP  and  for  follow-on  products  or  enhancements  to  the  product  as  far
out  as  the  team  can  see  (18  months  to  three  years).  In  startups,  this  request
usually elicits a response like, “How can I come up with future dates when

 
we barely know the first MVP delivery date?” Reassure your anxious product
development team that this first pass at a schedule isn’t set in stone.

Only because earlyvangelists are buying into your total vision will they
spend  money  for  an  incomplete,  buggy,  barely  functional  first  product. The
vision  should  convince  everyone  involved  that  this  is  an  opportunity  worth
the  investment  of  millions  of  dollars  and  years  of  work.  Ironically,  few
startups end up with products that look like their initial vision.

Finally, it’s never too early to think about strategic issues:

Will  it  create  network  effects?  A  single  fax  machine  was  useless  but
became more valuable as more people acquired them

Can  you  price  it  with  a  predictable  pricing  model—i.e.,  subscriptions
versus one-time sales?

Can  you  create  customer  lock-in/high  switching  costs?  Think  of  trying
to get your data from Facebook or from your doctor’s office

Can you have high gross margins?

Does it have organic demand versus marketing spend? Companies with
organic  demand  have  business  models  that  don’t  require  expensive
marketing. Think Google, eBay, Baidu, Skype, etc.

Product Features and Benefits

This portion of the value proposition brief captures what the product is and
why people will use or buy it.

While many engineers think new products are all about product features,
the product is just one of many elements of a successful startup. The product
features  list  is  a  one-page  document  consisting  of  one-  or  two-sentence
summaries of the top 10 (or fewer) features of the complete product vision.
(If  there’s  some  ambiguity  in  describing  a  particular  feature,  include  a
reference to a more detailed engineering document.)

Essentially,  the  feature  list  is  Product  Development’s  contract  with  the
rest  of  the  company.  The  biggest  challenge  will  be  deciding  what  features
will  ship  in  what  order.  Developing  the  MVP  will  start  the  prioritization
process. Once you get out of the building, customers will guide the process as

they begin interacting with the earliest version of the MVP.

Think  of  features  as  the  things  engineering  is  building,  and  think  of

benefits as the problem you’re solving for the customer.

Think of benefits as the problem you’re solving for
the customer.

Once  you  have  the  feature  list,  you  shape  a  product  benefits  list  by
describing  the  specific  product  benefits  as  seen  through  customers’  eyes.
(Something new? Something better? Faster? Cheaper?) Then develop a “user
story.” This short narrative explains what job the product will do. How will it
solve a problem that customers are eager to fix, or fulfill a need they have?
Ideally, the product solves a mission-critical problem, delivers a compelling,
exciting consumer benefit, or addresses an unspoken need. (Saves money or
time? Relieves a symptom? Fun, relaxing, faster? Better? Cheaper?) A bank-
software company might describe its user story this way:

Customers always face long lines at our bank on Fridays and on the first
and last days of the month when they come in to cash or deposit checks;
they get frustrated and often angry

We think we lose 5 percent to 8 percent of our customers as a result of
frustration

We  can  measure  lost  profits  of  about  $500,000  a  year,  significant
because it’s 7 percent of the total

This  $150,000  software  package  halves  the  time  it  takes  to  make  a
deposit and will be even faster in later versions

When 

thinking  about  product  features,  remember 

that  a  value
proposition  can  take  the  form  of  a  higher-performance  product  or  a  less
expensive  or  more  convenient  product.  It  can  address  a  market  niche  or
segment  or  solve  problems  in  a  new  or  different,  faster  or  cheaper  way.
Sometimes  the  product’s  physical  or  visual  design  or  even  the  brand  itself
may be different enough to command attention. Products don’t always solve
problems,  either.  While  most  business  products  do,  consumer  goods  more

 
often  serve  needs  in  areas  as  diverse  as  online  gaming,  social  networks,
fashion, and cars.

It’s  normal  for  marketers  to  want  to  describe  the  product  benefits,  but
it’s  likely  that  marketing  doesn’t  have  facts  about  customers  yet,  just
opinions. In a startup, the founders and Product Development are likely to be
the ones with the facts. So at this point, the marketing people would be wise
to  bite  their  tongues  and  listen  to  the  product  development  group’s
assumptions  about  the  features  and  exactly  how  they’ll  benefit  customers.
These  engineering-driven  benefits  represent  hypotheses  you’ll  test  against
real customer facts. In Phase 2, you’ll get out of the building to collect this
feedback directly from customers.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The  MVP  is  the  final  portion  of  this  first  value  proposition  brief.  It’s  a
concise summary of the smallest possible group of features that will work as
a  stand-alone  product  while  still  solving  at  least  the  “core”  problem  and
demonstrating the product’s value.

The MVP is:

a tactic for cutting back on wasted engineering hours

a  strategy  to  get  the  product  into  earlyvangelists  hands  as  soon  as
possible

a  tool  for  generating  maximum  customer  learning  in  the  shortest
possible time

Start  the  MVP  brief  by  defining  what  needs  to  be  learned—and  from
whom.  Customer  Development  efforts  will  engage  a  very  small  group  of
early  visionary  and  passionate  customers 
to  guide  product-feature
development until a profitable business model emerges. The sooner the MVP
is  in  their  hands,  the  sooner  feedback  can  arrive.  Rather  than  asking
customers  explicitly  about  feature  X,  Y  or  Z,  one  approach  to  defining  the
MVP  is  to  ask,  “What  is  the  smallest  or  least  complicated  problem  that  the
customer will pay us to solve?”

This approach runs counter to the typical cry for more features, which is

often  based  on  what  the  competitors  have  or  what  the  last  customer  visited
had to say. The MVP is the inverse of what most sales and marketing groups
ask of their development teams.

A goal of Customer Development is to understand
what not to ship.

Startups  tend  to  collect  a  list  of  features  that,  if  added  to  the  product,
would  get  just  that  one  additional  customer  to  buy.  Soon  a  10-page  feature
list evolves just to sell to 10 customers. That’s a plan for failure. The goal of
Customer  Development  is  not  to  collect  features  from  customers.  It’s  to
understand  what  not  to  ship.  The  perfect  feature  list  is  just  one  paragraph
long and can be sold to thousands or millions of customers. A core tenet of
the  Customer  Development  Manifesto  is  “less  is  more.”  Minimize  the
number  of  features  not  used  by  getting  a  MVP  into  customers’  hands  as
quickly  as  possible.  An  easy  guideline:  “no  new  features  until  you’ve
exhausted the search for a business model.”

Customer Segments: Who/Problem Hypothesis

This  brief  describes  who  the  customers  are  (the  customer  types)  and  what
problems, needs or passions they have. It includes five components:

customer problems, needs or passions

customer types

customer archetypes

a day in the life of customer

organizational map and customer influence map

The Customer Problem, Need or Passion

Products are sold because they solve a problem or fill a need. (See the bank
teller  story  in  Value  Proposition.)  Understanding  problems  and  needs
involves understanding their sources. Get out of the building to discover how
customers  experience  the  problem  and  why  (and  how  much)  it  matters  to
them.  Understand  the  organizational  impact  problem,  and  the  intensity  of
pain  it  causes  the  company/family/consumer.  Use  a  simple  “problem
recognition  scale”  for  each  important  type  of  customer  (Figure  3.2).
Customers will express:

a latent problem: they have a problem but don’t know it

a passive  problem:  they  know  of  the  problem  but  aren’t  motivated  or
aware of the opportunity to change

an active (or urgent) problem: they recognize a problem or passion and

are searching for a solution but haven’t done any serious work to solve
the problem

a  vision:  they  have  an  idea  for  solving  the  problem  and  even  have
cobbled  together  a  home-grown  solution,  but  are  prepared  to  pay  for  a
better one

Study the problem. Is your product solving a mission-critical company
problem  or  satisfying  a  must-have  consumer  need?  Is  your  product  a  must-
have  or  a  nice-to-have?  When  your  product  solves  a  problem  that  costs
customers  sleep,  revenue,  or  profits,  things  are  definitely  looking  up.  When
it’s  the  hottest  “new  new  thing”  in  town,  whether  that  town  is  physical  or
virtual,  capitalize  on  the  opportunity.  The  best  startups  discover  a  situation
where  customers  have 
themselves—they
simultaneously  discover  both  a  mission-critical  problem  and  a  customer-
visualized  solution.  Wow.  Now  simply  convince  the  customer  that  if  they
build  it  themselves,  they’re  detouring  into  a  different,  usually  non-core
business—your new business!

to  build  a  solution 

tried 

The best startups discover a situation where
customers have tried to build a solution themselves.

Then  again,  not  every  product  solves  problems.  Some  provide  fun  or
information,  others  glamour  or  romance.  Social  networks  don’t  solve
problems  but  sure  have  millions  of  visitors—they  fill  consumer  needs  and
desires.  Even  if  it’s  fun  or  pure  luxury,  recognize  that  consumers  require
justification for a purchase.

After  identifying  the  customer  types,  craft  a  hypothesis  about  their
emotional wants and desires. Describe how to convince these customers that
the  product  can  deliver  an  emotional  payoff:  glamour,  beauty,  wealth,
prestige, a hot date or lost pounds.

Customer Types

Whether a customer is spending time on a social network, buying a stick of
gum, or purchasing a million-dollar telecom system, every sale involves a set

 
of  decision-makers.  Thus  customer  analysis  starts  with  an  understanding  of
what types of customers to approach. Chances are several people in a number
of  categories  have  problems  that  your  product  can  solve  or  needs  or
ambitions that it can satisfy. Customer discovery identifies and probes these
different needs. Customer types include:

End Users:  The  day-to-day  users  of  a  product  push  the  buttons,  touch  the
product, use it, love it, and hate it. A deep understanding of their needs and
motivations  is  vital,  recognizing  that  the  end  user  may  often  have  the  least
influence in the sales or adoption process. This is typically true in complex
corporate sales.

Customer Types (Figure 3.2)

Influencers:  At  times,  the  most  powerful  pressure  on  a  customer’s  buying
decisions may not be something the startup did directly but something done
or  said  by  someone  who’s  uninvolved.  In  every  market  or  industry,  online
and off, a select group of individuals pioneers the trends, styles and opinions.
Ask a famous dress designer when a movie star wears her dress to the Oscars.

Or consider the effect of thousands of people clicking their Facebook “like”
button or Tweeting about a product, ad or service. Sometimes the influencers
are paid bloggers or pundits in market-research firms. They may be kids or
celebrities  who  wear  the  latest  fashions.  Include  the  target  list  of  outside
influencers  and  address  how  they’ll  be  reached.  Free  product,  payments,
celebrity events, free computers and online memberships are among the many
options.

Recommenders:  They 
influence  purchase  decisions  but  differ  from
influencers because their opinions can make or break a sale. A recommender
could be a widely read blogger raving about a new online game, a department
head  saying  any  new  PCs  should  come  from  Dell,  a  hospital  committee
approving a new medical device, or a spouse with a particularly strong brand
preference.  It  can  also  be  an  external  force  like  Gartner  Group,  Forrester

Decision-makers:  They  may  be  the  economic  buyers  or  reside  even  higher
up  in  the  decision-making  hierarchy.  Decision-makers  wield  the  ultimate

makers) or VITOs (very important top officers) or perhaps “Mom,” “Dad” or
“honey.” Be sure to understand their motivations.

Saboteurs:  They  can  lurk  anywhere  (as  saboteurs  do)  and  hold  titles
including CFO, CIO, child, spouse, or purchasing agent with “friends.” They
can be found in strategic planning departments or in your own home, where
their  veto  can  slow  things  dramatically.  Find  them.  Identify  patterns  that
reveal where they’re hiding in the decision process.

Later, during customer validation, knowing all the players in detail will
be  essential.  For  now,  simply  recognize  that  the  customer  is  more
complicated than a single individual.

Customer Archetypes

Remember  the  axiom  “A  picture  is  worth  a  thousand  words”?  There’s  no
better way for the startup team to visualize its customer targets than to take
the  time  to  depict  each  of  the  key  customer  types—the  end  user  and  the
decision-maker  at  a  minimum  (at  least  make  a  few  sketches  or  doodles).
Customer archetypes help the team visualize who will buy or use the product
and helps crystallize product strategy, customer acquisition, and more.

Customer Archetype (Figure 3.3)

In  a  business-to-business  sale,  does  the  end  user  work  in  an  office,  a
cubicle  or  a  boiler  room?  Is  he  or  she  a  business  traveler,  a  presenter,  or  a
heads-down number cruncher? Is the decision-maker in a corner office, is she
a  scientist  in  a  research  lab  with  a  wall  lined  with  prestigious  degrees  and
awards, or is she on the factory floor?

To  understand  more  about  customer  archetypes  and  how  they’re  used,
review  a  detailed  discussion  in  the  next  section,  “Customers/Source—

Web/Mobile.”  Once  you’ve  read  that,  create  a  comprehensive  view  of  each
key customer archetype, using the data you collected.

Consumer  archetypes  are  generally  easier  to  create  than  business-to-
business,  where  relationships  are  far  more  complex.  Identify  as  many
hypotheses  about  the  buyer’s  demographic  and  psychographic  profile  as
possible.  Is  the  buyer  affluent,  fashion-conscious,  healthy  and  active?
Married with pets and toddlers or teens? In a house, an apartment, or a trailer
park?  These  characteristics  will  influence  many  aspects  of  the  business
model, including customer relationships, channel, and revenue model.

A Day in the Life of a Customer

One  of  the  most  powerful  ways  to  understand  your  customers,  whether
they’re consumer or business customers, is to discover how they “work” and
write it down, delineating a day in their life.

...discover how customers “work” and write it
down, delineating a day in their life.

In  the  case  of  businesses,  this  step  requires  a  deep  understanding  of  a
target  company  on  many  levels.  Let’s  use  selling  software  to  a  bank  as  an
example.  How  a  bank  works  isn’t  something  you’ll  discover  by  cashing  a
check. You want to know how the world looks from a banker’s perspective.
To  begin  with,  how  do  the  potential  end  users  of  the  product  (the  tellers)
spend their days? What products do they use? How much time do they spend
using  them?  How  would  life  change  for  these  users  after  they  have  your
product? Unless you’ve been a bank teller, these questions should leave you
feeling somewhat at a loss, but how are you going to sell a product to a bank
to solve tellers’ problems if you don’t understand how they work?

(If  you’re  not  an  experienced  salesperson,  this  whole  notion  of  getting
out  of  the  building  can  sound  intimidating.  The  “Get  Out  of  the  Building”
section of customer discovery, Chapter 4, describes how to set up your first
meetings.)

Now run this exercise from the perspective of branch managers. How do
they  spend  their  day?  How  would  your  new  product  affect  them?  Run  it

 
again,  this  time  thinking  about  bank  presidents.  What  on  earth  do  they  do?
What do they read? Who influences their decisions? How will your product
affect her? And if you’re installing a product that connects to other software
the bank has, you’re going to have deal with the IT organization. How do the
IT people spend their day? What other software do they run? How are their
existing  systems  configured?  Who  are  their  preferred  vendors?  Are  they
standing  at  the  door  with  confetti  and  Champagne  waiting  to  welcome  yet
another new company with yet another product?

The answers are easy. Asking the right questions is
hard.

Business products are generally purchased because they solve problems,
so a deep understanding of the buyer is required. If you’re selling a retailer
point-of-sale  tools,  for  example,  can  someone  on  your  team  work  behind  a
busy counter for a few days? There’s no better way to understand than to dive
in. Learn how prospective users currently solve their problems, online or off,
and how they’d do it differently using the new product. What will motivate
these customers to buy? Draw a vivid and specific picture of a day in the life
of  the  customer,  and  do  the  research  in  the  same  place  where  they  do  their
work  or  have  their  fun,  not  in  the  company  conference  room  or  alone  at  a
local Starbucks.

Finally, back to our banking example, do you know about trends in the
banking industry? Is there a banking-industry software consortium? Are there
bank  software  trade  shows?  Industry  analysts?  Unless  you’ve  come  from
your  target  industry,  this  part  of  your  customer-problem  brief  may  include
little more than lots of question marks. That’s OK. In customer development,
the answers turn out to be easy; it’s asking the right questions that’s difficult.
You’ll be going out and talking to customers with the goal of filling in all the
blank spots on the customer-problem brief.

For  a  consumer  product,  the  same  exercise  is  applicable.  How  do
consumers solve their problems today? How would they solve their problems
with  your  product?  Would  they  be  happier?  Smarter?  Feel  better?  Do  you
understand what will motivate these customers to buy?

Your  final  exam  doesn’t  happen  until  you  come  back  to  the  company

 
and, in meetings with the product development team and your peers, draw a
vivid and specific picture of a day in the life of your customer.

A Sample Organizational/Influence Map (Figure 3.4)

Organizational/Influence Maps

Now having a deeper understanding of a customer’s typical day, you realize
that  except  in  rare  cases,  most  customers  don’t  work  by  themselves.
Consumers  interact  with  friends  and  family,  while  businesspeople  interact
with  their  colleagues.  List  the  people  who  could  influence  a  customer’s
buying  decisions  and  draw  a  tentative  diagram  of  the  prospective  customer
and  all  the  influences  surrounding  him  or  her.  Also  depict  the  product’s
impact on their day-to-day work or personal life. Then build a map showing
potentially influential people who surround the user. At a large company, the
diagram will be complex, with lots of initial unknowns.

Channels Hypothesis

The  channel  brief  describes  how  the  product  gets  from  company  to
customers.

The  difference  between  physical  and  web/mobile  channels  is  dramatic.
In  one,  physical  goods  move  from  a  loading  dock  to  a  customer  or  a  retail
outlet.  In  another,  no  human  involvement  is  required,  as  the  product  is
offered  and  sold  online.  (If  the  product  itself  is  bits,  it’s  both  sold  and
delivered online.)

Physical  channels  have  been  around  for  centuries.  They’re  an
“intermediate customer” the startup has to deal with, and the barriers can be
significant: high cost, long lead times, lack of control, and lack of promotion,
to  name  a  few.  However,  the  rewards  can  be  great.  In  the  20th  century,
physical  distribution  was  especially  important.  Back  then,  the  pinnacle  of
distribution  was  to  be  sold  at  Walmart,  which  welcomes  20  million
Americans every day.

Consider whether your product fits the channel.

Most companies use both web/mobile and physical channels today. For
example,  even  with  some  10,000  massive  physical  stores,  Walmart  also
invests  heavily  in  walmart.com,  an  alternate  channel,  as  most  national
retailers  do.  Most  channel  strategies,  particularly  for  physical  goods,  today
involve both physical and web/mobile channels. Whether a company uses a
physical or web channel, it must generate customer demand and drive it into
the sales channel. Physical and web channels employ very different demand-
creation activities.

 
Consider Whether Your Product “Fits” the
Channel

Different sales channels support different product price bands. For example, a
salesperson  selling  enterprise  software  needs  to  bring  in  more  than  $1.5
million  in  annual  revenue.  On  the  other  hand,  few  Smartphone  applications
sell for more than $10, minus the typical 30 percent app-store fee. Other e-
tailers such as Amazon and bestbuy.com regularly sell products for hundreds
if  not  thousands  of  dollars,  sometimes  keeping  as  much  as  half  the  gross
revenue for themselves.

Be  sure  to  factor  all  channel  costs  into  the  pricing  hypothesis,  since
many  channels  charge  for  distribution,  promotion,  and  even  sometimes  for
placing  products  on  the  shelves  or  returning  unsold  merchandise  to  the
company.  Channel  selection  changes  the  company’s  revenue  model,  often
dramatically, so be sure to revisit and update the revenue stream hypothesis
based  on  the  company’s  costs  and  net  revenue  when  making  the  channel
selection.  (Always  compute  the  revenue  stream  on  a  “net”  basis,  reflecting
only revenue that will arrive in company coffers once the dust settles.)

Physical Channel Choices

Each  physical  distribution  channel  has  its  own  unique  set  of  strengths,
weaknesses and costs. Some channels are “indirect,” with a company selling
to  intermediaries  sometimes  called  “resellers”  (distributors,  value-added
resellers,  dealers,  etc.),  who  then  sell  to  an  end  user.  For  example,  when  a
handheld  video-game  maker  wants  to  use  local  independent  toy  stores  as  a
channel, those toy stores buy merchandise from a local or national distributor.
Your company calls on the distributor but can’t possibly afford to visit every
independent  toy  store  in  America.  In  general,  physical  distribution  is  as
complex as it is costly. Here are some of the most common alternatives.

Direct sales:  These  are  salespeople  you  employ  to  either  call  on  end  users
(consumers or businesses) or sell to other resellers.

     Strengths: superb oversight and control; sales force focused on/dedicated

to your company’s products.

     Weaknesses: Most expensive alternative; hard to find great talent and even
more difficult to manage. The product price/margin may not support the
expense.

Physical Distribution Channel Choices (Figure 3.5)

Independent  sales-rep  firms:  Independent  salespeople  represent  multiple
companies  to  a  particular  channel  or  chain,  generally  on  a  geographic  basis
(although some rep firms are national). They typically handle compatible but
not competing product lines. They often work on commission, less often on
retainer or a per-sale fee.

     Strengths: Fast way to get national distribution at a variable cost with little

upfront spending.

     Weaknesses: They’re loyal to their customer, not to you, the selling
company; they’re more of a conduit than a proactive marketer.

Systems  integrators/value-added  resellers  (VARs):  Unlike  independent
sales-rep firms, systems integrators/VARs add value to the products they sell
(consulting,  installation,  or  integration  of  additional  products  from  other
manufacturers). These organizations sell principally in technology industries
in business-to-business sales. Systems integrators can be as small as a one- or
two-man local IT consultant or vast global networks like Accenture and IBM.

     Strengths: Fast way to get national distribution and “whole product

integration and installation” at a variable cost with no upfront cost to the
company.

     Weaknesses: They’re loyal to their customer, not to you; they are more a
conduit than a proactive marketer. They require immense care and
feeding such as promotional effort, hand-holding, training and incentives
and as a rule are challenged to organize into a consistent national
footprint and harder still to motivate.

Distributors/Resellers:  Mid-  and  low-volume  business  and  consumer
through  distributors—intermediaries  between
products  are  often  sold 
manufacturer  and  retailer  who  do  little  more  than  stock  the  product  locally
and make it available in modest quantities to local stores. Some distributors
(think CDW for computers, Arrow for electronic components, McKesson for
pharmaceuticals) are national in scope and carry literally thousands of items.
It’s difficult and costly to get a distributor to promote a particular product.

     Strengths: They provide personal attention and can showcase and promote

products they like.

     Weaknesses: Expensive. Generally have an “order taker” mentality and
are rarely marketing/promotion partners. They may have the rights to
return your product. Typically don’t pay until the product is “sold
through.”

Dealers  (aka  Retailers):  Unlike  a  distributor,  a  dealer  has  bought  the
product.  Whether  they’re  selling  to  businesses  or  consumers,  dealers  are
usually independent retailers or small chains that display and promote what’s
generally a limited selection of products. Typically, they take a large markup

(often  double  their  cost,  called  a  “keystone”)  on  the  wholesale  price  to
compensate for higher operating costs and smaller volumes. Dealers seldom
deal directly with “the factory” (your company), instead buying goods from a
distributor  or  similar  intermediary,  in  more  modest  quantities  than,  say,
Costco.  Consumer  products  are  also  still  sold  in  “mom-and-pop”  food  and
convenience stores.

     Strengths: They provide personal attention and can showcase and promote

products they like.

     Weaknesses: It’s hard and costly to build a new business using dealers as

the principal channel.

Mass merchandisers:  In  the  U.S.,  national  chains  from  Walmart  to  Costco
and  Home  Depot  to  7-Eleven  move  massive  amounts  of  merchandise  to
consumers.  As  a  result,  they  wield  enormous  influence  over  manufacturers
and extract their “pound of flesh” by often charging 50 percent of the retail
price  for  carrying  the  product.  They  seldom  launch  new  products  without  a
successful  “test  market”  in  a  modest  number  of  stores.  And  when  that  test
succeeds, the retailer asks for “slotting allowances” in the tens of thousands
of dollars (in addition to their markup) for agreeing to display the product.

     Strengths: Massive distribution and advertising/marketing potential.

     Weaknesses: Long lead time to sell into (at times a year or more),

extremely high cost, little marketing control and less opportunity to
influence. May have the right to return unsold product months later. Pay
painfully slowly, sometimes taking six months or more.

Original Equipment Manufacturers: OEMs buy a product to make it part
of their larger product. A PC maker buys hard drives, semiconductors, circuit
boards  and  keyboards  from  scores  of  manufacturers  and  assembles  those
products  into  a  larger,  usually  more  complex  product  for  sale  to  end  users.
Issues a startup should consider:

The startup’s brand, image and identity are subsumed by the OEM and
often  invisible  to  the  end  user.  (“Intel  inside”  is  a  rare  exception  where  the
component’s brand and reputation add value); your startup’s success depends
completely on  the  success  of  the  OEM’s  product,  not  the  startup’s;  and  the
OEM’s  sense  of  customer  needs,  issues,  and  reactions  can  obscure  the
startup’s understanding of customer needs.

     Strengths: Massive volume potential.

     Weaknesses: Typically low-margin; no “branding benefit” or visibility for

your startup.

Which Channel Should I Use?

A  tragic  mistake  many  startups  make  is  to  overreach  on  initial  channel
efforts.  Until  the  company  completes  customer  validation,  it  should  pick  a
sales  channel  representing  the  greatest  potential  and  focus  on  it  to  the
exclusion  of  all  others.  Your  company  is  still  testing  and  expanding  its
hypotheses and needs to focus on learning. Don’t try to launch a product via
direct sales, chain stores and direct mail all at once—it’s almost impossible to
succeed at all three. The big exception, of course: physical-channel launches
with simultaneous web-marketing (and sometimes sales) support.

Decisions  about  channel  and  pricing  are  interrelated,  so  develop  the
channel hypothesis while working simultaneously on the revenue and pricing
hypothesis.  For  example,  retail  distribution  cuts  the  company’s  revenue
dramatically while direct sales may deliver more sales dollars but do so more
slowly.  When  considering  which  channels  to  adopt,  keep  these  criteria  in
mind:

Are there established buying habits/practices in the product category?

Does  the  channel  strengthen  the  sales  process?  At  what  cost  to  the
company?

What  are  the  price  and  complexity  issues  surrounding  sale  of  the
product?

Startups  seldom  get  the  channel  strategy  right  the  first  time.  Most
technology startups, for example, assume that a direct sales force is the way
to go, a hypothesis that’s often proved wrong. It’s almost always smartest—
and  safest—to  first  observe  existing  buying  patterns  and  habits  for  similar
products  and  product  categories,  since  customers  are  demonstrating  their
preferred channel by spending their money there.

Value Proposition 2: Market-Type and Competitive
Hypothesis

The market-type brief describes which of the four market types the company
fits  into.  (Refer  to  Chapter  1,  Rule  7,  in  the  Customer  Development
Manifesto.) It also adds a competitive brief.

Regardless of the channel they choose, startups adopt (or pursue) one of
four market types. The consequences of choosing the wrong market type are
severe (prematurely burning cash on marketing and sales before it’s needed),
but unlike decisions about product features, the market-type choice is a “late-
binding”  decision.  While  a  final  decision  can  be  deferred  until  customer
creation, it’s wise to develop and test an initial market-type hypothesis while
moving  through  the  customer  discovery  phase.  In  the  next  chapters,  we’ll
come back to the market type selection process many times, and refine and
deepen the analysis after further discussing customers and market.

In  this  brief,  seek  a  provisional  answer  to  just  one  question:  is  the
company  entering  an  existing  market,  re-segmenting  an  existing  market,
creating a new market or cloning a market?

Market type drives marketing spending, sales
timing and cash need.

Market Type

For  some  startups,  the  market-type  choice  is  pretty  clear.  When  entering  a
market  that  has  a  ton  of  competitors,  whether  it’s  smartphones,  social

 
networks, glucose meters or airplanes, the choice has already been made for
you:  it’s  an  existing  market.  On  the  other  hand,  if  your  company  invents  a
new class of product no one has ever seen before, it’s most likely in a new
market. However, most companies have the luxury of choosing which market
type to use. So how to make the decision? A few simple questions begin the
process:

Is  there  an  established,  well-defined  market  with  large  numbers  of
customers?  Do  customers  know  the  name  of  the  market  and  do
competitors exist? Does the product have an edge (better performance,
features, service) over competitors? If so, it’s an existing market

Would  some  part  of  an  existing  market  buy  a  product  designed  to
address its specific needs? Even if it cost more? Or even if it had worse
performance  in  an  aspect  of  the  product  irrelevant  to  this  niche?  If  so,
think re-segmented market/niche strategy

Another  type  of  re-segmentation  answers  the  question:  Are  there
customers  at  the  low  end  of  an  existing  market  who  will  buy  “good
enough” performance if they can get it at a substantially lower price? If
yes, think re-segmented market/low-cost strategy

Without an established and well-defined market, there are obviously no
existing customers or competitors and a new market is being created

Startups  in  Russia,  India,  Indonesia,  Brazil,  Japan  and  China  (where
they  have  large  local  markets  and  language  and  cultural  barriers)  have
an additional market type: the clone market. Can you adopt/borrow/copy
an  already-successful  business  model  and  company  from  the  U.S.  and
adapt  it  to  local  language  and  buying  preferences.  (Not  too  long  from
now, ideas from those countries will be cloned in the U.S.)

When you talk to customers, they’ll have lots of opinions about where
the product fits. Don’t worry about wavering among the market-type choices.
For  now,  just  look  at  each  market  type  and  pick  the  one  that  best  fits  the
company’s vision today. Table 3.1 summarizes of the trade-offs.

Market Type Trade-Offs (Table 3.1)

One  of  the  best  tools  for  sorting  out  existing  market  entry  strategies  is
derived from military operations research. It suggests a few simple rules that
companies can use to analyze an existing market:

If  a  single  company  has  74  percent  of  the  market,  the  market  has
become  an  effective  monopoly.  For  a  startup,  that’s  an  unassailable
position for a head-on assault. (Think Google in search or Facebook in
social networks.)

If  the  combined  market  share  for  the  market  leader  and  the  second-
ranking  company  is  greater  than  74  percent  and  the  first  company  is
within 1.7 times the share of the second, it means a duopoly commands
the  market.  Its  position  is  impervious  to  attack  by  a  startup.  (In  the
telecom sector, Cisco’s and Juniper’s combined share of the core router
market fits this description.)

If  a  company  has  41  percent  market  share  and  at  least  1.7  times  the
market share of the next-largest company, it’s the market leader.

For a startup, this too is a very difficult market to enter. Markets with a

clear market leader offer an opportunity for re-segementation.

If the biggest player in a market has at least a 26 percent market share,

the  market  is  unstable,  with  a  strong  possibility  of  abrupt  shifts  in  the
company  rankings.  Here  there  may  be  some  existing  market  entry
opportunities.

If the biggest player has less than 26 percent market share, it has no real
influence on the market. Startups that want to enter an existing market
find these the easiest to penetrate.

If you decide to attack a market that has just one dominant player, you
need to be prepared to spend three times the combined sales and marketing
budget  of  that  dominant  player.  (Ouch—so  much  for  going  head-on  with
Google or Facebook.)

In a market that has multiple participants, the cost of entry is lower, but
you still need to spend 1.7 times the combined sales and marketing budget of
the company you plan to attack. (To enter an existing market, you must steal
market  share  from  an  incumbent,  hence  the  war  analogy.)  Table  3.2
summarizes the existing market cost of entry.

Market Type—Cost of Entry (Table 3.2)

Competition in an Existing Market

Now  that  you  understand  the  type  of  market  you’re  in,  the  competitive
landscape becomes clearer. If you believe your company and product fit into
an  existing  market,  you  need  to  understand  how  your  product  outperforms
your competitors’. In an existing market the customers can tell you what the
basis of competition is. It nearly always has to do with key product attributes,
but sometimes it’s other components of the business model—e.g., channel or

price. Strive for a product or feature or improvement that can get a customer
to say, “I’ll pay anything for that.”

Positioning  the  product  against  the  slew  of  existing  competitors  is
accomplished  by  adroitly  selecting  the  basis  of  competition  where  you  can
win.  Remember  it’s  not  always  features.  It  can  be  convenience,  services,
brand, etc., where the new entry is clearly better. Summarize the thinking in a
brief.  When  entering  an  existing  market,  good  questions  to  address  in  the
brief include:

Who are the incumbents and which ones drive the market?

What is the market share of each competitor?

How many marketing and sales dollars will the market leaders spend to
compete?

What will the cost of entry be against incumbent competitors?

What  performance  attributes  have  customers  said  are  important?  How
do competitors define performance?

What share of this market does the company want to capture in the first
three years?

How do the competitors define the market?

Are  there  existing  standards?  If  so,  whose  agenda  is  driving  the
standards?

Does  the  company  seek  to  embrace  these  standards,  extend  them,  or
replace  them?  (If  the  answer  is  to  extend  or  replace  them,  this  may
indicate  a  re-segmented  market.)  When  you  enter  an  existing  market,
though, also fill out the competitive brief discussed later in this section
to shape the positioning further

One  way  to  plan  your  attack  in  an  existing  market  is  to  refer  to  your
business model canvas. What jobs are your customers asking your product to
fill? What problem is your value proposition solving?

Re-segmenting an Existing Market

In  an  existing  market,  your  startup  is  the  weakest  player  with  the  least
resources. Therefore, attacking the strongest players head-on is foolish. You
want to choose strategies that acknowledge your weaknesses and play to your
agility. If there’s a dominant player with more than 74 percent market share,
don’t  attack  that  market  head-on.  Why?  Because  you  need  three  times  the
resources of the market leader. Instead, target your attack at the point where
your  limited  resources  can  make  a  difference.  You’ll  segment  the  existing
market  to  create  a  submarket  where  your  product  can  be  unique  or
substantially different. Or if you can create a new market, you can define a
space the market leader doesn’t address at all.

If your enemy is superior in strength, evade him. If
angry irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may
grow arrogant.

If  the  dominant  player  has  between  26  percent  and  74  percent  market
share,  pick  your  battles  carefully.  Remember  the  cost  of  a  head-on  attack:
three times the budget of a single competitor or 1.7 times that of a competitor
in a crowded market.

Most startups don’t have access to those financial resources. Therefore,
re-segmenting  the  market  or  creating  a  new  market  is  almost  always  the
default when faced with a dominant incumbent. All the marketing tricks for
nipping  at  the  heels  of  an  entrenched  competitor  can  be  used  here.  Most  of
them  were  invented  2,500  years  ago  by  Sun  Tzu  and  described  in  his  book
The  Art  of  War.  Paraphrasing  about:  “All  warfare  is  based  on  deception.  If
your enemy is superior evade him. If angry irritate him. If equally matched,
fight, and if not, re-evaluate”.

Your goal is to become No. 1 in something important to your customer.
It could be product attribute, territory, distribution chain/retailer, or customer
base. Keep segmenting the market (by age, income, region, etc.) and focusing
on  the  competitors’  weak  points  until  you  have  a  battle  you  can  win.
Remember, any company can take customers away from any other company
—if  it  can  define  the  battle.  When  re-segmenting  an  existing  market,
positioning rests on either:
     (a)  finding a unique niche where some product feature or service

 
redefines the market, creating a clear competitive advantage

     (b)  being the “low-cost provider” or
     (c)  combining differentiation and lower operating cost into a Blue Ocean

Strategy that creates an uncontested market space and makes the
competition irrelevant while creating and capturing new demand.
Southwest Airlines was among the first to re-segment air travel this
way, followed by many copycat failures and much later by JetBlue.
Cirque du Soleil is an example of a Blue Ocean re-segmentation,
offering product differentiation as well as lower operating costs

In an existing market, your startup is the weakest
player with the least resources.

When re-segmenting for a unique niche, address these questions in this brief:

What existing markets are customers coming from?

What are the unique characteristics of those customers?

What  compelling  needs  of  those  customers  are  unmet  by  existing
suppliers?

What  compelling  product  features  will  get  customers  to  abandon  their
current suppliers?

Why couldn’t existing companies offer the same thing?

How  long  will  it  take  you  to  grow  a  market  of  sufficient  size?  What
size?

How will the company educate the market and create demand?

Given that no customers yet exist in the new segment, what are realistic
sales forecasts?

How can this forecast be tested?

Can  parts  of  the  business  model  be  changed  to  differentiate  the
company?

For  this  type  of  startup,  draw  a  “market  map”  (a  diagram  of  how  this

 
new market will look) as shown in Figure 3.6, to illustrate why the company
is  unique.  Draw  the  market  map  with  the  startup  in  the  center.  A  re-
segmented  market  assumes  that  customers  flow  from  an  existing  market(s).
Draw the existing markets that customers should flow from (remember that a
market  is  a  set  of  companies  with  common  attributes).  Draw  the  product
features  and  functions  that,  when  assembled,  best  describe  the  new  product
(think Hershey bar, now with peanut butter and zero calories—each attribute
draws different customer groups).

Example of a Market Map (Figure 3.6)

When re-segmenting based on low cost, questions to address include:

What existing markets are customers coming from?

What are the unique characteristics of those customers?

What  price  will  it  take  (known  as  “switching  cost”)  to  get  those
customers to spend time online with or buy from the new company?

What features are customers willing to give up to get the lower price?

How can this hypothesis be tested quantitatively?

Finally,  visualize  why  thousands  of  new  customers  will  believe  in  and
move to this market. And beware the “low-price provider” re-segmentation,
since competitors can reprice in a matter of days if not hours, eviscerating the
positioning that everyone just bet the new business on.

What could be better than a market with no
competitors?

Entering a New Market

What  if  there  are  no  competitors?  What  if,  after  talking  to  all  your  early
customers,  you  continue  to  hear,  “There’s  nothing  else  like  what  your
company is offering”? What if, after looking at all the quantitative data, you
can’t  find  other  companies  with  comparable  products?  Congratulations—
you’re creating a new market. At first glance, a new market has great appeal.
A standing joke is that every new market has its own descriptive TLA (three-
letter  acronym).  What  could  be  better  than  a  market  with  no  competitors?
And absence of competition typically means that pricing isn’t a competitive
issue  but  an  issue  of  what  the  market  will  bear.  Wow,  no  competitors  and
high margins!

A  company  creating  a  new  market  is  a  radically  different  type  of
company from one entering or reframing an existing market. While there are
no  market-share  battles  with  competitors,  there  are  also  no  existing
customers.  If  there  are  no  existing  customers,  even  an  infinite  demand-
creation  budget  at  the  point  of  product  launch  won’t  garner  market  share.
Creating a new market is about long-term customer education and adoption.

 
New-market  entries  are  by  far  the  most  expensive  demand-creation
challenges, particularly since the marketer can’t say “tastier than Yummies”
or  “faster  than  Porsche”  or  “cheaper  than  Brand  X,”  since  no  such
comparables  exist.  At  the  risk  of  sounding  pedantic,  creating  a  new  market
means  a  market  doesn’t  currently  exist—there  are  no  customers.  When
entering a new market, good questions to address include:

What are the markets adjacent to the new one being created?

What markets will potential customers come from?

What’s the company’s vision and why will lots of people care?

What  “never  could  have  been  done  before”  will  make  customers
use/buy?

How long will it take to educate potential customers to grow a market of
sufficient size? What size is that?

How will the company educate the market? How will it create demand?

Given that no customers yet exist, what are realistic sales forecasts for
the first three years?

How  much  financing  will  it  take  to  soldier  on  while  educating  and
growing the market?

What  will  stop  a  well-heeled  competitor  from  taking  over  the  market
once  the  startup  develops  it?  (This  phenomenon  is  the  source  of  the
phrase “Pioneers are the ones with arrows in their backs.”)

Is  the  product  better-defined  as  one  that  will  re-segment  a  market  or
enter an existing one?

New-market entries are by far the most expensive...

Companies  compete  in  new  markets  not  by  besting  other  companies
with  product  features  but  by  convincing  a  set  of  customers  that  the  new
company’s market vision is real and solves a real problem a different way. A
few  classic  examples:  Snapple,  Toyota  Prius,  Siebel,  Groupon,  and
Facebook. However, who the users are, and the definition of the market itself

 
are  both  clearly  unknown.  This  brief  defines  the  new  market  and  its  users
with the startup at the center.

One last thing to consider: startups creating new markets won’t create a
market of sufficient size to generate a profit until three to seven years from
product  launch.  This  sobering  piece  of  data  is  derived  from  looking  at  the
results of hundreds of high-tech startups of the last twenty years. While you
may  be  convinced  your  startup  is  the  exception,  the  odds  say  that  unless
you’re  in  a  “bubble  economy,”  it  takes  time  for  new  ideas  and  products  to
diffuse  and  catch  on.  (A  bubble  economy  is  defined  as  a  time  of  irrational
exuberance in a market when all normal rules are repealed.)
Market type, in summary: Market type is one of the most important choices
founders need to make and agree on with investors, since it drives spending,
timing and competitive analysis. The choice doesn’t need to be made during
customer  discovery,  but  an  initial  hypothesis  is  needed.  If  investors  are
expecting  substantial  revenue  in  Year  One,  thinking  they’ve  invested  in  an
existing-market company, the outcome is typically a new CEO. Market type
selection drives spending and budget as well as revenue expectations.

Competitive Brief

Once  you  understand  your  market  type,  it’s  relatively  simple  to  assemble  a
competitive  brief.  This  will  help  you  understand  how  you’ll  compete  in  the
market.

When  entering  an  existing  market  or  re-segmenting  one,  your  first
instinct may be that the basis of competition is simply the product features of
your  value  proposition.  That  may  be,  but  you  may  be  missing  a  bigger
competitive  advantage.  Is  there  something  about  partners,  the  channel,
resources,  etc.  that  would  be  a  game  changer?  Think  of  Apple  and  the
original iPod. It combined a hardware player, which lots of vendors had, with
an  easy-to-use  software  application,  iTunes,  which  no  one  had  (but  others
could have built) and then added partners at the record labels (which required
Steve  Jobs’  reality-distortion  field).  The  business  model  canvas  is  a  perfect
vehicle for brainstorming some of these ideas.

In a new market, it’s tempting to say, “We have no
competition.” But you’ll be wrong.

Explain  how  and  why  your  new  product  is  better  than  its  competitors.

Other items the competitive brief should consider:

How have existing competitors defined the basis of competition? Is it in
terms  of  product  attributes?  Service?  What  are  their  claims?  Features?
What makes the new company and its product stand out as dramatically
different? Features? Performance? Price?

Will  customers  care  if  the  new  product  lets  them  do  something  they
couldn’t do before?

In a retail store, which competitive products will be shelved next to the
new entry?

For web/mobile apps, assess competitors’ product quality, features, sales
or user data, and traffic levels.

What’s  strongest  about  each  competitor’s  product?  What  do  current
customers  like  most  about  those  existing  products?  What  would
customers change about them?

What  is  a  customer’s  “reason  to  buy”  or  use  the  product,  app,  or  site?
And which competitors will they abandon to do so, and why?

If  you’re  in  a  new  market,  it’s  tempting  to  say,  “We  have  no
competition.” But you’ll be wrong. The new product itself may not yet exist,
but what do people do today without it? Do they simply not do something, or
do  it  badly  or  inefficiently?  What  will  your  new  product  enable  them  to  do
that they couldn’t do before. Why will they care?

It’s  only  natural  that  startups  compare  themselves  with  other  startups
around  them,  but  it’s  important  to  remember  a  key  tenet  of  Customer
Development: Don’t make a list of all competitors’ features to simply make a
bigger  list.  A  few  incremental  features  or  improvements  seldom  result  in  a
great,  scalable  company.  What’s  more,  in  their  first  few  years,  startups
seldom put one another out of business.

Winners understand why customers buy.

 
 
While  startups  compete  for  funding  and  technical  resources,  winners
understand  why  customers  buy.  The  losers  never  do.  Competitive  analysis
starts  at  why  customers  will  buy  and  then  looks  at  the  whole  market,
including new and established competitors.

Customer Relationships Hypothesis

This customer-relationship brief describes how you get  customers  into  your
sales  channel,  keep  them  as  customers  and  grow  additional  revenue  from
them over time.

 
 
The “Get, Keep, Grow” Funnel in Physical Channels (Figure 3.7)

While  Figure  3.7  illustrates  the  flow  through  the  process,  Table  3.3
provides an overview of the most widely used activities, by channel, for each
step  in  the  “get,  keep,  grow”  process.  In  this  hypothesis  we’ll  focus  on  the
column on the left: the physical channel.

Every  company,  whether  its  product  or  channel  is  physical  or
web/mobile, can summarize its mission in three succinct phrases: build great

products;  “get,  keep,  and  grow”  customers;  and  make  money  directly  or
indirectly from these customers. Customer relationships are the strategies and
tactics to get, keep and grow customers.

Getting customers, sometimes called demand creation, drives customers

into your chosen sales channel(s).

Keeping  customers,  or  retention,  gives  customers  reasons  to  stick  with

the company and product.

Growing customers involves selling them more of what they’ve bought
as  well  as  new  and  different  products  and  encourages  them  to  refer  new
customers.

“Get, Keep and Grow” are among the most
important hypotheses for any startup.

“Get, keep and grow” are among the most important hypotheses for any
startup. You will die without customers and these are most expensive parts of
any company. The diagram in Figure 3.7 provides an overview of the entire
customer relationship life cycle. This hypothesis will “dissect” the diagram,
starting on the left from “awareness,” the first step, and proceeding through
each of the many steps in the “get, keep, grow” process.

PROCEED WITH CAUTION: There is no way you can implement all
this or even process it in one sitting. What follows is an overview of all
the things you need to consider as you shape a marketing strategy that’s
best for your startup.

Developing Customer Relationships in the Physical
Channel

 
 
 
Customer Relationship Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.3)

Think of the “get customers” process as a “funnel” in which the greatest
number  of  potential  customers—those  on  the  left—have  awareness  of  the
product. The number of potential customers declines as their interest grows,
as they consider buying, and then as they make the actual purchase. During
customer  discovery,  you’ll  launch  a  series  of  small-scale,  inexpensive  “get
customers” experiments to determine the tactics that move customers into and
through  the  funnel  in  a  repeatable,  scalable,  and  cost-effective  way.  Later,
once  you  have  customers,  you’ll  begin  customer  retention  activities  to  keep
the customers and use upselling, cross-selling and customer referral programs
to grow the number of customers and the revenue.

“Get Customers”

Getting  customers,  or  demand  creation,  has  four  distinct  stages  in  the
physical  channel:  awareness,  interest,  consideration,  and  purchase.  See
Figure 3.8.

The “Get Customers” Funnel for Physical Goods (Figure 3.8)

PROCEED WITH CAUTION: There is no way you can implement all
these  alternatives  at  once  or  even  process  them  in  one  sitting.  What
follows  is  an  overview  of  all  the  things  you  need  to  consider  as  you
shape a marketing strategy that’s best for you.

 
Awareness lets potential customers know about your product or service
(think TV commercials shouting “new airline” or radio ads saying, “Now you
can fly cheaper”). It gets people thinking about the product or service.

Interest  means  the  message  is  no  longer  being  ignored  even  if  the
prospect isn’t ready to act. Think of people saying, “I should try one of those
low-cost  airlines  sometime,”  as  a  result  of  the  initial  awareness  effort.  One
more push could move this prospect to the consideration step.

Consideration follows interest when the message is powerful enough or
contains a convincing offer that might lead to the thought, “Why don’t I take
JetBlue on my trip to Florida next month?” Consideration may take the form
of a free trial where it’s offered.

Purchase  follows  consideration.  It’s  clearly  the  desired  result  of  “get”

activities.

Creating demand for a consumer electronics product sold on Walmart’s
shelves  is  different  from  opening  a  chain  of  pizza  parlors  or  selling  a  new
type  of  semiconductor.  And  while  the  description  of  customer  relationship
activities  may  seem  simple  at  first,  it’s  actually  the  result  of  a  complex
interplay among customers, the sales channel, the value proposition and the
budget for marketing activities. When you get it right, it all comes together in
a repeatable, scalable, profitable business model.

Develop Your “Get Customers” Strategy

 
Earned and Paid Media Feeding the “Get Customers” Funnel
(Figure 3.9)

The first three funnel stages—awareness, interest, and consideration—happen
in the consumer’s mind, out of reach of anything other than your advertising
messages.  The  first  two  stages—awareness  and  interest—are  out  of  your
control until the customer identifies herself or himself to some channel like a
retailer, a direct-sales rep, or a website and says, “I’m interested.” (This could

happen  when  the  customer  leaves  a  business  card  at  a  trade  show,  requests
more  information  online,  or  talks  with  a  company  representative.)  The  “get
customers” activity moves customers as far into the funnel as possible until
the  customer  self-identifies  and  the  channel  takes  over  the  “consideration”
and “purchase” activity. But it all starts with awareness.

“Get Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.3a)

An  important  caution:  be  aware  of  the  way  the  physical-channel  has
changed in the past decade. Whether a product is sold at a car dealership, a
gravel pit, a 7-Eleven or the trendiest retail boutique, 21st-century consumers
begin  their  search  for  products  online.  So  online  marketing  is  every  bit  as
important  to  marketers  in  the  physical  channel  as  it  is  to  their  web
counterparts. Your job as a marketer is to be sure customers can easily find
your  product  or  service  on  the  web.  This  means  that  physical-channel
marketers  need  to  pay  almost  as  much  attention  to  the  next  section  of  this
chapter—“Web/Mobile Customer Relationships”—as they pay to this one.

(For best results, read both sections before beginning the tasks outlined
here.) Marketers in the physical channel must embrace basic web-marketing

tactics  at  every  opportunity—websites,  AdWords,  online  advertising—even
in the unlikely event that your product isn’t for sale online. Online, your job
is to “pull” customers to your product so they can discover it online, even if
they then buy it at your warehouse, at Walmart or face-to-face from a sales
representative.

Awareness,  interest,  and  consideration  in  the  physical  channel  are
primarily  driven  by  two  types  of  communication  tactics:  earned  (or  free)
media and paid media.

Earned media is the free exposure a company generates. In the physical
channel,  it  includes  press  releases,  product  reviews,  editorial  features  and  a
range  of  “guerrilla  marketing”  tactics  such  as  handing  out  fliers  at  trade
shows  where  the  company  doesn’t  buy  a  booth.  These  tactics  are  often
favored  by  startups  because  they’re  far  less  expensive  than  paid  media
efforts.  Many  consumer  products  find  their  first  customers  through  free
sample or trial programs or by handing out samples or discount coupons on
street corners.

The downside of earned media: unlike paid media, which run on specific
dates and locations, editorial coverage is unpredictable and runs—or doesn’t
—as editorial space or the product’s news value allow.

Online marketing is every bit as important to
marketers in the physical channel as it is to their
web counterparts.

Paid  media  is  exactly  what  it  sounds  like:  media  exposure  that’s
purchased  on  TV,  blimps,  direct  mail  or  the  web.  This  kind  of  activity  can
cost  literally  millions  of  dollars  when  rolled  out,  so  customer  discovery
employs small-scale tests to see which tactic will deliver the best results later,
at product launch.

Other  paid-media  awareness-creation  tactics  that  aren’t  free  include
advertising, trade shows, direct mail, catalogs, events, telemarketing, and in-
store  promotion.  Most  physical-channel  marketers  also  promote  their
products online, of course. During customer discovery your spending will be
low until you successfully test a tactic and prove that it generates leads and
sales cost-effectively.

 
Simple “Get Customer” Tactics to Consider

Build a “get customers”-hypothesis spending spreadsheet that lists:

the free and paid media programs

what the company hopes to achieve and at what cost

Before conducting these or any other tests of customer-relationship
tactics:

     1.  Create a “pass/fail” metric for each “Get” test that defines whether it
worked and should be expanded. An example: will we get one sales
call for every 30 phone calls made to prospects?

     2.  Consider a methodology for improving the results of each test, such as:

If the call blitz doesn’t work, we will e-mail first and then call each
prospect twice.

     3.  Be sure the tests are objectively measurable so that the big spending

decisions that follow aren’t made based on the fact that “it felt good”
or “seems to work well.” JetBlue’s metric for radio ads might seek to
generate reservations-hotline calls at a cost of $1 each. The logic: they
can spend $3 on marketing (sometimes called customer acquisition
cost) to sell a round-trip ticket, and one caller in three buys a ticket on
average.

     4.  Don’t forget that people buy from people. Create, don’t avoid,

opportunities to talk via phone or in person with potential customers.
There are few more powerful sales tools!

Most companies selling through the physical
channel will use a variety of web/mobile marketing
tactics...

     5.  Remember that most companies selling through the physical channel
still use a variety of web/mobile marketing tactics to gain awareness
and sales for their products, so be sure to include elements of
web/mobile “Get” programs from the next section.

 
The  sample  spreadsheet  in  Figure  3.10  charts  the  costs  and  expected
results of the “get” efforts for a startup’s new heavy-duty, $2,500 printer sold
to  businesses  through  office-products  stores.  The  spreadsheet  is  used  to  be
sure the program tests are affordable.

“Keep Customers”

As the “Get” customers exercise clearly illustrates, getting a new customer is
an  expensive  process.  Thus  it’s  important  to  think  now  about  how  the
company  will  keep,  or  retain,  customers  it’s  worked  so  hard  to  get.  When
customers  cancel  a  subscription,  never  return  to  a  supermarket,  or  close  a
corporate purchasing account, it’s called “churn” or “attrition” (the opposite

of retention!).

The “Keep Customers” Funnel (Figure 3.11)

Develop Your “Keep Customers” Strategy

“Keep Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.3b)

For  any  customer  retention  strategy  to  work,  first  the  company  must
deliver  on  all  its  promises  that  got  the  customers  to  buy  in  the  first  place.
Customers  need  to  love  the  product  or  service,  and  every  customer-facing
aspect  of  the  business  model  has  to  perform  exceptionally,  from  customer
service and support to complaint-handling, delivery, billing, and more. First,
a  steady  stream  of  product  upgrades  and  enhancements  should  always  keep
the  product  ahead  of  competition.  By  their  nature,  these  are  core-value-
creation  activities  and  should  be  addressed  in  the  value  proposition
hypothesis.

Next,  begin  to  think  about  programs  that  reach  out  to  customers
proactively to strengthen or bolster retention. This can be as simple as placing
(often  quite  powerful)  outbound  calls  to  be  sure  customers  are  happy  or  as
complex as a multi-tiered loyalty-points program to reward repeat purchases.
In a startup’s early days, it’s hard to test the impact of loyalty programs, since
the results need to be measured over long periods of time.

In a startup’s early days, it’s hard to test the impact
of loyalty programs...

In  addition,  consider  loyalty  programs  such  as  points,  rewards  and
discounts as well as long-term retention incentives like multi-year contracts.
Make  them  part  of  the  hypothesis,  and  test  them  where  possible  during
customer validation.

Finally,  consider  other  parts  of  the  business  model  canvas.  Are  there
things your partners can do to help you keep customers? Other resources you
can use?

Simple  “Keep  Customers”  Tactics  to  Consider:  During  customer
discovery,  put  together  plans  and  then  test  some  basic,  inexpensive  “Keep”
activities to see how they perform. Use the test results to guide future plans in
customer validation and creation. Some simple programs to test and consider:

Loyalty  programs:  How  you  will  use  loyalty  programs  to  retain
customers.

Customer check-in calls: Put together a plan to call every customer, or
every  fifth  customer,  once  a  month  or  once  a  quarter  simply  to  thank
them  for  their  business  and  see  how  they  like  the  product.  While  you
have  them  on  the  phone,  probe  for  questions  they  have  about  the
product,  features  or  functions.  (By  the  way,  e-mail  is  still  a  poor
substitute for a voice or Skype connection.) Over time, target at least a
15  percent  improvement  in  repeat  sales  or  renewals  from  customers
who’ve talked.

Launch a customer-satisfaction survey: Whether on the web or by mail
or  e-mail,  plan  to  check  with  customers  about  their  use  of  and
satisfaction with the product or service. (Probe for complaints or lack of
use, and reach out to any who express problems. Look for at least a 15
percent reduction in churn from those who’ve been contacted.)

Send product-update bulletins: Create simple tip sheets or user notes on
how  customers  are  making  the  most  of  the  product.  (Send  them  to  all
users, and offer a prize for users whose tips are published later. This is

 
difficult to measure precisely but inexpensive to implement.)

Monitor  customer-service  issues:  Customers  who  complain  frequently
are most likely to churn. (Get proactive with these customers, fix their
problems, and make them happy. Far fewer complainers should leave if
they’ve had their problems addressed.)

Customer  lock-in/high  switching  costs:  If  it’s  relatively  easy  for  your
customer  to  switch  from  your  products  to  your  competitors’,  you’ll
probably have a higher churn rate. You may want to consider tactics for
“locking  in”  customers  to  your  product  or  solution  (through  long-term
contracts, unique technology, or data that can’t be easily transferred).

It’s 5-10x cheaper to keep a customer than to
acquire one.

Longer-Term  Customer  Retention:  Customer  retention  is  effective  only
when the customers self-identify so they can be contacted by the salesperson,
channel partner, or company representative charged with keeping them happy
and coming back to buy more. As you learn more about individual customers
over time, retention becomes increasingly individualized and targeted based
on the observed and measured customer behavior. This subject is more fully
addressed  during  customer  validation,  when  there  are  more  customers  to
think about keeping.
Specific retention metrics to monitor and act on include:

purchase patterns: volume, frequency, slowdowns or halts

participation  in  “grow  customers”  programs  (described  in  the  next
section)

number  of  complaints  to  customer  service,  refund  requests,  problems,
and the like

participation,  activity  levels,  redemptions  in  loyalty  and  incentive
programs

Retention  programs  live  or  die  by  a  close  monitoring  of  customer
behavior to learn who’s staying and who’s leaving and why. You’ll organize

 
the metrics around “cohorts,” or common groups of customers (such as “new
customers  signed  in  January”).  Three-month  customers,  for  example,  may
behave one way while nine-month customers may be more or less active than
their newer brethren.

“Grow Customers”

Once a company has a customer, why not sell them more, since it costs less
than  acquiring  new  customers?  Most  startups  think  only  about  the  revenue
they receive in their first sale to a customer, but smart companies think about
the revenue they can get over the lifetime of the relationship they have with a
customer.  Measuring  customer  lifetime  value  can  be  important  when
computing  a  startup’s  potential.  Describe  how  the  company  will  get  more
revenue  from  its  existing  customer  base  with  programs  that  sell  more  and
encourage customers to refer new ones to the company.

The “Grow Customers” Funnel (Figure 3.12)

Develop a “Grow Customers” Strategy

“Grow Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 3.3c)

Your “Grow” strategy will have two key components: get the customers you
have  to  buy  more,  and  get  them  to  refer  other  customers  to  you.  A  few
“Grow” tactics only work in the physical channel, such as:

“Upsell” offers such as “spend $25 more and get free shipping”

In-pack promotional mailers of offers, coupons, and samples

Specials or premiums only available to customers who meet with a sales
rep

Direct  mail  is  also  an  effective  customer  growth  tool,  of  course.
Increasingly,  however,  physical  channel  marketers  are  turning  to  online
marketing  rather  than  postal  mail  because  of  its  speed,  lower  cost,  and  the
ability  to  target  better.  You  should  also  study  the  discussion  of  “Grow”
strategy and tactics in the web/mobile section for many more ideas. This will
help  you  shape  your  initial  programs  to  grow  your  customer  base  through
additional sales and referrals.

It’s  difficult  at  this  time  to  think  through  and  test  extensive  “Grow”
customers programs because you have very few customers to test them with.
Far  more  detail  is  provided  in  the  customer  validation  step,  when  there  are
enough customers aboard your “Grow” programs.

Customer Relationships Hypothesis

  This  customer  relationships  brief  describes  how  you  get  customers  to
your  website  or  mobile  app,  keep  them  as  customers  and  grow  additional
revenue from them over time.

The “Get, Keep and Grow” Customers Funnel in Web/Mobile
(Figure 3.13)

PROCEED WITH CAUTION: This is not the time to broadly launch
your site or app to a wide audience. You are writing the briefs here, not
implementing tactics with your MVP!

 
Review  the  previous  section  on  customer  relationships  for  physical
products before starting this one. The web/mobile customer funnel in Figure
3.13  is  quite  different  from  its  physical  counterpart  in  Figure  3.7.  Getting
customers  here  is  simpler,  having  only  two  steps.  It  also  includes  a  “viral
loop” where early customers invite friends and colleagues to explore the new
product.  Finally,  not  visible  in  the  diagram  is  the  fact  that  web/mobile
startups can test tactics faster, market less expensively, and reach out to far
more customers than companies in the physical channel.

The test of “Get, Keep and Grow” activities during customer discovery
is  small-scale,  exposing  the  “rough  and  dirty,”  or  low-fidelity,  minimum
viable product to a modest number of customers, perhaps a few hundred or
so, to gauge their reaction to the business model (including value proposition,
price,  and  product  features.)  Discovery  explores  which  tactics  work  and
gauges initial reactions to the MVP.

Customer Relationship for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4)

 
The  right-hand  column  of  Table  3.4  provides  an  overview  of
web/mobile “Get, Keep and Grow” strategies and tactics. It focuses first on
getting customers, since the company first has to have customers before it can
work to keep them, sell them a second time, or grow them.

Many web/mobile products operate as multi-sided markets; Google and
Facebook  are  canonical  examples.  Consumers  use  the  product  at  no  cost.
Advertisers  pay  the  company  to  reach  those  customers  with  ads,  AdWords,
textlinks  and  other  marketing  messages.  That  revenue  is  why  Google  can
afford to build massive data centers and offer search for “Free.”

Multi-sided  marketers  need  two  separate,  parallel  “Get”  approaches—
one for the users and another for the payers, since the value proposition for
each is quite different. Almost universally, multi-sided marketers focus first
on efforts to get users. A company that has aggregated an audience of many
millions can almost certainly find marketers eager to pay for the privilege of
communicating with that audience.

Getting Customers: Acquisition and Activation

Develop the company’s hypothesis about how it will “Get” customers.

There  are  a  million-plus  apps  for  sale  on  mobile  app  stores  and  an
infinite  number  of  commerce,  social  and  content  websites,  so  the  mere  fact
that  you’ve  launched  a  new  one  doesn’t  make  it  a  successful  business.
Building your product is the easy part. The hard part is getting customers to
find your app, site or product. It’s a daunting, never-ending challenge to build
customer relationships, quite literally, one customer at a time.

Getting Customers.

Acquisition vs. Activation: What’s the Difference?

 
Let’s get started with the first two steps for “getting” customers: acquisition
and activation.

“Get Customers” Tools for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4a)

Customer  Acquisition:  The  acquisition  phase  equates  to  the  “awareness,”
“interest,”  and  “consideration”  steps  in  the  physical  channel,  where
customers learn about and explore a product before they buy. In web/mobile
apps, the “Get” effort focuses on bringing as many customers as possible to
the  company’s  online  “front  door”—the  landing  page.  There,  they’re
introduced to the product and hopefully buy it or use it. Since the number of
people  who  come  to  a  landing  page  and  look  but  don’t  buy  or  use  is  often
very  high,  web/mobile  “Get”  plans  must  reach  lots  of  people—for  a
consumer website, that can be millions.

Customer Activation: This second step in the “Get” process is much like the
“purchase”  step  in  the  physical  channel.  Here  the  customer  shows  interest
through  a  free  download  or  trial,  a  request  for  more  information,  or  a
purchase.  A  customer  should  be  considered  activated  even  if  he  doesn’t

purchase or register, as long as the company has enough information to re-
contact him (whether by e-mail, phone, text, etc.) with explicit permission to
do so.

Overview: How Customers Shop Online

Unlike  the  door-to-door  salesmen  of  yesteryear,  your  job  on  the  web  is  to
“pull”  customers  to  you  rather  than  to  push  your  product  at  them.  The  web
offers a near-limitless tool set to help you pull customers in.

Your job on the web is to “pull” customers to you...

Your  first  step  in  customer  acquisition  and  activation  is  understanding  how
people buy or engage with your product. Here’s how it happens:

Step one: People discover a need or want to solve a problem. They say, “I
want  to  throw  a  party,”  or  feel  lonely  and  decide  to  find  a  hot  party  or  a
dating site. Then what?

Step two: They begin a search. Overwhelmingly, in this century, that search
begins  online.  It  often  happens  at  Google.com,  but  it  can  happen  on
Facebook,  where  they  ask  their  friends,  or  on  Quora,  where  they  solicit
opinions,  or  on  hundreds  of  other  special-interest  “recommendation”  sites
from Yelp to Zagat to TripAdvisor.com.

Step three:  They  don’t  look  very  hard.  People  don’t  just  “find”  you  online,
and in fact they often only pay attention to the first few things they uncover
(how often do you search beyond the first page of results on Google?). You
must  make  your  site,  app  or  product  as  visible  as  humanly  possible,  in  as
many of these places as possible where your customers are likely to begin the
search. (The entire “Get” section ahead will guide you in doing just this.)

Step four: They go where they’re invited, entertained or informed. You don’t
“earn”  interest  from  your  customers  with  hard-boiled  sales  pitches  or  bland
information.  In  a  typical  Google  search,  you’re  one  of  many  thousands  of
options the customer can click on. So you have to earn that click by providing

 
inviting,  helpful  or  entertaining  information  in  lots  of  formats  (copy,
diagrams,  white  papers,  blogs,  videos,  games,  demos,  you  name  it)  and  by
participating in the communities and social media your customers are likely
to be.

Develop your “Get Customers” Strategy

Make  your  information  as  rich  and  inviting—and  widely  available—as
possible  and  cast  the  widest-possible  net  when  people  begin  their  search.
Provide  helpful,  non-sales-y  information  that  leads  them  back  to  your
product, app, or site. Then the selling process begins.

Use the way people make decisions to guide your acquisition and activation
strategy:

1.  Determine  who  your  audience  is,  then  your  goal  is  to  be  prominent
wherever  they  spend  time  on  the  web.  Skateboarders  don’t  read  The
Wall  Street  Journal  or  TechCrunch  very  much,  so  focus  on
skateboarding sites, blogs and the like.

2.  What  kind  of  content  will  they  find  attractive?  Our  skateboarders
probably  prefer  illustrations,  games,  and  videos  over  long  essays  and
white  papers.  Reach  them  with  the  kinds  of  content  they’ll  find  most
interesting  and  helpful,  such  as  tips  on  safer  skateboarding  or  bolder
tricks, not long essays on the finer points of boarding.

3.  Make  sure  your  content  works  in  the  location.  Quora,  Twitter,  and
Facebook  users  expect  short,  interesting  items  and  get  bogged  down
with  or  ignore  long  ones.  Social  networks  don’t  have  much  use  for
lengthy sales pitches. Be sure your content “fits” where you put it.

4.  Participate  in  the  communities  your  customers  are  a  part  of.  Answer
questions,  provide  feedback,  offer  tips,  and  gently  invite  people  to
explore your product.

5.  Create  content  that  people  want  to  link  to.  Whether  it’s  helpful  tips,
FAQs,  cartoons  or  fun  videos,  make  your  content  the  kind  of  content
your  customers  want  to  share  with  friends.  The  result  extends  your
invitation to those friends more often than not.

Customer Acquisition Tactics to Test

The best way to get this started is to put your initial acquisition test plan into
a  spreadsheet  outlining  the  activities,  their  costs,  and  each  program’s  goals.
See  a  sample  acquisition-plan  spreadsheet  in  the  “Activate Plan”  section  of
Chapter  8.  Acquisition  begins  by  using  free  or  earned  web-media
opportunities  to  acquire  customers,  since  “free”  is  obviously  the  best  cost.
The web offers many free crowd-sourcing or acquisition opportunities (SEO,
social media, viral marketing, buzz and more).

Earned or free acquisition tactics:

Public  relations:  Generate  small  “test”  amounts  of  news  and  feature
coverage  about  the  problem  (not  the  product  itself)  on  websites,  blogs
and  social  nets.  Don’t  publicize  the  product  or  solution  until  customer
validation,  it’s  just  too  early.  (Public  relations  doesn’t  mean  hire  an
expensive  outside  agency.  During  customer  discovery,  you  should  be
learning this firsthand.)

Viral  marketing:  This  often-confused  term  refers  to  three  types  of
acquisition marketing, each used in different web/mobile channels. The
three  are  perhaps  the  most  important  customer  acquisition  tactics  for
web/mobile  marketers,  because  they’re  all  free  or  inexpensive  to
implement.  This  is  discussed  in  “grow” customers  where  viral  activity
encourages customers to refer others

Search  engine  optimization  (SEO),  an  unpaid,  or  “natural,”  search
option, directs consumers to the product or service

Social networking encourages friends and early customers to blog about
a  product  or  a  company,  use  Facebook  to  “like”  it,  or  use  Twitter  and
other tools to broadcast personal recommendations

After  you  get  the  free  acquisition  programs  going,  you  should  start  to

test paid tactics.

Paid acquisition tactics:

It’s  hard  to  determine  how  much  money  to  spend  on  acquisition  tactics,  in
part because there are so many variables: how much funding you have, how
confident  you  are  in  your  hypotheses,  and  how  hard  it  is  to  find  your
customers  are  three  of  the  key  considerations.  Obviously,  free  tactics  are
better than paid tactics when they deliver quality customers with strong LTV
in  sufficient  numbers  to  create  a  great  business.  As  a  rule,  however,  life  is
seldom that easy, and you’ll need to test a blend of paid tactics along with a
wider variety of free ones.

Here are some of the most common web/mobile paid acquisition tactics you
should consider:

Pay-per-click  (PPC)  advertising:  targetable,  accountable  paid  search
advertising on Google and other search engines drives targeted traffic to
the company

Online  or  traditional  media  advertising:  often  used  to  introduce  a  new
product or service

Affiliate marketing: other related websites are paid to drive traffic to the
product site or app.

Online  lead  generation:  purchase  of  permission-based  e-mail  lists  to
solicit  interest  (much  trickier  and  more  highly  regulated  for  direct-to-
mobile-phone messaging)

Review the list of “get” customers tactics from the physical channel to
see  which  ones  warrant  testing  for  your  web/mobile  startup.  Candidates
certainly include advertising, direct mail, and everything from zany on-street
promotions to blimps, billboards and more.

Some quick and simple acquisition tests:

In  Phase  2  of  customer  discovery  you’ll  run  some  small-scale  acquisition
tests with the free and paid tactics described above to test your understanding
of the customer problem/need. In Phase 3 of customer discovery, you’ll again
use  acquisition  tools  to  gauge  initial  customer  reaction  to  the  MVP  and
discover whether the MVP is a compelling solution to the problem. These are
limited and targeted tests, not a product launch. Press releases make no sense

here,  for  example,  since  wide  dissemination  could  either  bring  too  many
customers  or  create  the  false  impression  that  the  product  is  “launched”  and
finished.
Your  Phase  2  &  3  acquisition  tests  should  be  limited  to  controllable,
inexpensive, easily measured tactics like these:
          •      Buy  $500  worth  of  AdWords  and  see  if  they’ll  drive  customers
representing five or 10 times that amount in potential revenue to the
site or app and at least get them to register. Test at least two different
headlines  and  as  many  calls  to  action,  carefully  monitoring  the
performance of each. Drop ineffective ones and refine the best

Viral marketing can’t start until there is a customer
base to viralize.

     •   Use Facebook messages or Tweet to measurable audiences to invite at
least 1,000 people to explore the new product. Test several different
messages or invitations to be sure the messaging about the product is
clear.  If  none  of  the  messages  delivers  engagement  or  registrations,
the product or offer may well be the problem

     •   Viral marketing: Getting customers can’t start until there’s a customer
base to viralize. There are several types of viral marketing, so review
the viral discussion in the previous section (and also here). Network-
effect businesses should consider viral activities sooner

     •   Post referral banners using Commission Junction to get sites offering
your offer. Spend $1,000 in referral fees to relevant websites (usually
$12 per referral). If the banners run and the money’s largely unspent,
move on

     •   Buy an e-mail blast list of targeted customers for $500 or $1,000. Send
at least two versions of the offer and expect to generate at least three
times the potential revenue to at least sign up, if not a purchase
     •   Traffic partners are another important source of users or customers that
fuel  the  “Get”  effort.  These  are  typically  contractual  relationships
with other companies that provide predictable streams of customers or
users to your company while you provide either customers or fees to
the partner. This is so important to most web/mobile businesses that
it’s addressed in its own “traffic partners” hypothesis

 
Who’s Creating This Content?

Successful  web/mobile  startup  teams  have  a  combination  of  skills:  great
technology skills (hacking/hardware/science), great hustling skills (to search
for the business model, customers and market), and great user-facing design.
The  co-founder  who’s  the  user-interface/design  expertise  owns  content
creation. Ideally he or she is talented enough to create it without legions of
hourly-rate  agency  folk  around.  Use  guru.com  and  craigslist.com  to  find
talent, cost-effective freelancers with good references.

Customer Activation Tactics to Test:

Activation is the second step in getting customers. As discussed earlier, this
is  where  the  customer  either  makes  a  purchase  or,  at  a  minimum,  raises  a
hand  and  says,  “I’m  interested,  contact  me.”  Activation  could  be  an
exploratory  visit  your  website  or  free  mobile  app  to  see  how  a  game  is
played,  a  comment  posted  on  a  blog  or  social  network,  or  the  use  of  a  free
search  engine.  At  the  other  end  of  the  spectrum,  low-cost  mobile  apps  and
other  products  find  transactions  to  be  the  best  initial  activation,  since  the
product may be a free version or cost only 99 cents.

Activation is the choke point... where customers
decide whether they want to participate, play or
purchase.

For web/mobile businesses, activation is the choke point—the make-or-
break place where customers decide whether they want to participate, play, or
purchase.  Here,  unlike  the  physical  channel,  the  “product  is  the  salesman,”
encouraging visitors to explore, try, or read about the product on their own,
without  pressure  or  patter  from  a  sales  representative.  Activation  is  always
encouraged  by  a  compelling  value  proposition,  well-communicated  and
coupled  with  a  good,  clear  offer  and  a  low-fidelity  (in  discovery)  or  hi-
fidelity  (in  validation)  MVP.  Start  by  creating  an  activation-tactics  plan  in
simple spreadsheet form as in this example.

 
Many  startups  falsely  assume  that  because  their  customers  are  online,
online communication is all their customers want or expect. Very often, even
a  single  phone  call  can  make  a  dramatic  difference  in  acquisition  and
activation rates. In some instances, as few as half the customers who discover
a product online will activate or buy without human-to-human contact. And
the  presence  of  a  phone  number  is  known  to  communicate  the  company’s
authenticity.  Just  the  presence  of  the  company’s  phone  number—even  if
never called—can increase its online click-through rate by five percent to 30
percent.  (When  adding  a  phone  number,  be  sure  it’s  answered  promptly,
knowledgeably,  and  effectively  by  someone  with  incentives  to  activate  the
caller.)

Acquisition and Activation in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 3.15)

Some quick activation tests:

     •   Capture the customer’s e-mail address and get permission to follow up
with further information. Follow up with 1,000 customers and expect
at least 50 or more to agree to activate

     •   Offer incentives for activation: Offer a free trial, download, or white

paper  or  a  significant  discount  to  500  or  1,000  customers.  Try  this
with  at  least  three  different  offers,  hoping  to  find  at  least  one  that
generates a 5 percent or greater response rate. Keep testing until you
do, and then calculate the revenue model based on response rates, and
costs

     •   Call 100 prospects who don’t activate immediately. See if the phone
calls generate enough of a response-rate improvement to warrant the
cost. Three times the response rate is probably needed

     •   Free-to-paid conversion: Offer a seven- or 14-day free trial of an app,
service,  or  web/mobile  product.  Then  compare  the  total  60-day
acquisition revenue with the Get results of the typical paid offer. Or
offer  the  use  of  some  but  not  all  of  the  site  or  app’s  features.
eHarmony.com, for example, lets people find their ideal matches for
free but requires paid enrollment to tell your dream date that you’ve
discovered him or her

Even a single phone call can make a dramatic
difference in acquisition and activation rates.

          •      Use free-download websites  to  offer  free  downloads  or  trials.  Make
sure  the  revenue  generated  over  a  90-day  period  exceeds  that  of  the
standard activation offer

Monitor the results of all tests and, when you’re not satisfied (or it fails

your pass/fail test) revise the program and test again.

Keeping Customers (Customer Retention)

 
The “Keep Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 3.16)

Keeping  customers  in  the  web/mobile  channels  has  the  same  goal  as
retention efforts in the physical world: to minimize customer churn/attrition
by  providing  great  products  and  services,  and  interacting  with  customers
often. (At this point in customer discovery, there aren’t customers to retain,
so identify retention programs to test in the future.) Retention is done more
easily online, where companies have the incredible power and ability to track

and monitor every single prospect’s or customer’s individual behavior or lack
of behavior (without violating their privacy).

“Keep Customers” Tools in Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4b)

Loyalty  and  points  programs  and  other  tactics  borrowed  from  the
physical  channel  can  also  play  a  significant  role  here,  as  can  elegant
personalized  customer  service  and  support,  conducted  digitally  as  much  as
possible. Strong digital help tools, FAQs, user blogs, clubs, and newsletters
help with retention as well.

Customer Retention Strategy

Retention programs live or die by a close monitoring of customer behavior to
learn who’s staying and who’s leaving and why. It’s critical to instrument the
product  not  in  order  to  track  everything  but  in  order  to  follow  the  most
important customer behaviors you want to improve.

For example:

Track  start  dates  and  sources  of  each  customer  (referred  by  a  blogger,
another site, etc.)

Track customers’ activity level individually. How often do they come?
How long is each visit? What’s the time span between visits?

When  do  customers  abandon,  and  what  were  they  doing  that  caused
them to do so?

Monitor customers’ behavior on-site: what do they click on, what don’t
they click on?

Track customer referrals to others and the sources and activity level of
referred visitors

Track  the  results  of  each  promotion,  whether  outbound  or  on  the  site
itself

PROCEED  WITH  CAUTION:  Remember, 
an
overview/tutorial.  There’s  no  way  you  can  implement  all  this  or  even
process this in one sitting.

this 

is 

Keep the following guidelines in mind as you test:

E-mail is easy to ignore and at times feels like spam, so be careful about
overly relying on it. At least four of five e-mails are never opened, and
consumers often unsubscribe from self-serving marketing e-mails

Consumers  often  resent  “faux”  personalization.  People  appreciate
legitimate,  helpful  personalization  if  they’ve  opted  in  for  example
(“Here  are  the  sneakers  we  have  in  your  size,  11D”  is  far  better  than
“Great buys for Bob”)

Don’t get lazy and make automated marketing and e-mail programs your
only  customer-retention  efforts.  Focus  on  great  product,  product

 
 
enchancements, terrific service and other core retention initiatives

Embrace  social  networks  as  points  of  retention.  Use  them  to  keep
visibility high and to invite customers and friends back often

The key for retention for web/mobile channels is that the data customers
have  given  you  make  personalized  retention  efforts  easy.  But  you  need  to
collect  it.  Observe  each  customer’s  behavior  and  interact  with  customers
based on what they do or don’t do.

Track the behavior of each customer individually. Use that data to create
a  personal  one-to-one  relationship  that  guides  him  to  the  next  steps  the
company wants him to take. (But always respect personal-data privacy.)

Retention programs live or die by a close
monitoring of customer behavior.

Simple Retention Tests to Consider:

The hypothesis should include some core initial retention efforts that will be
discussed  during  discovery  and  tested  on  a  modest  scale  later,  during
customer validation. Be sure to include digital versions of relevant programs
outlined in the physical section. Some specific tactics to test:
     •   Outreach programs, including welcome e-mails, how-to guides, and
phone calls thanking the user for coming aboard and offering simple
tips on how to get more out of the product. Consider retention e-mails
like these:
   We haven’t seen you visit in two weeks. Is everything OK?
   I’ve noticed you’ve had a few problems. How can we help?
   Have you seen some of the new features on our site?
   Here are five “power user” ideas for getting more out of your time

at XYZ.com

     •   Blogs, RSS and news feeds to further engage customers or users with

the product or site

     •   Loyalty programs that encourage and reward repeat visits, purchases, or

referrals borrowed from the physical channel

     •   Contests and special events: webinars, special guests, new features, and

 
          
          
          
          
other reasons for current customers to come back

          •      Mobile  app  push  notifications:  iOS/Android  gives  developers  the
ability to push messages to users even when the app is closed. For app
developers,  getting  this  right  is  critical  to  retention  and  customer
engagement

     •   Product updates and enhancements to the actual product itself always
drive  loyalty  and  retention  (and  communicating  them  to  customers
helps)

Getting new customers is painful and costly, so
keeping those already on the roster is easier and
more cost-effective.

     •   Placing live phone calls to users several weeks or (if annual) a month
or  more  before  contract  renewal  is  a  good  option  if  you  have  a
subscription  revenue  model.  Make  them  friendly,  service-oriented
calls, but always listen for signs of potential churn and be ready with
a deal, discount or offer to save the customer. Remember: getting new
customers is painful and costly, so keeping those already on the roster
is easier and more cost-effective

     •   Tips-and-tricks newsletters, time-triggered e-mails every seven or 14

days based on users’ on-site behavior or lack of visits

          •      Personalized  customer  service  and  support,  conducted  digitally  as
much as possible. Strong digital help tools, FAQs, user blogs, clubs,
and newsletters help with retention as well

     •   Customer lock-in/high switching costs: If it’s relatively easy for your
customer  to  switch  from  your  products  to  your  competitors’  (in  an
existing  market)  you’ll  probably  have  a  higher  churn  rate.  You  may
want to consider tactics to “lock in” your customer to your product or
solution (through unique technology, data that can’t be transferred—
think  Facebook  and  LinkedIn—or  high  startup  costs  with  a  new
vendor.)

Monitor Specific Retention Metrics

 
Monitor and act on at least these basic retention metrics:

signs of dwindling visits, page views or time spent on the site or app

increased time between visits

average customer life (how long they stay active) and, if possible later,
lifetime value

increases in complaints, help or support tickets

reduced response rates or open rates on company e-mails

Organize the metrics around “cohorts,” or common groups of customers
(like  “those  who  joined  in  January”),  since,  for  example,  three-month
customers  may  behave  one  way  while  nine-month  customers  may  be  much
more or less active than their newer brethren.

Growing Customers (New Revenue and Referrals)

The “Grow Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels
(Figure 3.17)

There  are  two  ways  to  grow  existing  customers:  get  current  customers  to
spend  more  money  or  encourage  them  to  send  more  customers  to  the
company.

“Grow Customers” Tools for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 3.4c)

1. Get Current Customers to Spend More

Getting current customers to buy more starts by making sure they’re satisfied
with  the  product,  performance  and  price.  Then  you  try  to  sell  them  more
product, upgrade their service, or extend their contracts. These activities are
important for the long-term, so test at least a few during customer validation.
Some of the basic approaches to Grow Customers include:

Cross-sell programs that encourage buyers of a product to buy adjacent
products. Getting buyers of toner cartridges, for example—to buy paper,

 
pencils, and other office products

Up-selling programs that promote the purchase of “more” of higher-end
products.  For  example,  buying  cases  of  toner  rather  than  single
cartridges,  or  the  purchase  of  copiers,  fax  machines  and  other  office
machines along with the toner

Next-selling  programs  that  concentrate  on  the  next  order:  can  the
company  encourage  a  long-term  toner  contract,  sell  the  customer
envelopes  to  put  the  copies  in,  or  become  his  primary  office-products
supplier?  These  basic  customer  growth  strategies  work  in  consumer
goods as well as business-to-business

Unbundling,  which  sometimes  grows  revenue.  If  a  product  is  complex
or  multi-featured,  split  it  into  several  products,  each  sold  separately.
This works well in many tech, software, and industrial product areas

For  now,  develop  a  hypothesis  about  how  the  company  will  grow  its

customers, and test those ideas with—who else?—customers.

Some simple “grow” programs to consider:

Every “thank you” or confirmation page should suggest multiple items
the customer may also find interesting, and ideally provide an incentive
for doing so

New  items,  special  offers,  and  discounts  for  increasing  the  order  size
should be prominent and integrated with the checkout process for high
visibility

e-commerece  companies  should  have  “recommendation  engines.”  “If
you bought X, you’ll love Y”

e-commerce  companies  should  include  special  offers  and  discounts  in
each shipment

e-mail  customers  to  introduce  new  and  different  products  or  “add-on”
features to buy

Promote  special  sales  and  offers  on  new  products  or  services  the
customer hasn’t bought

Customer  referrals  are  the  most  common  type  of  viral  marketing,
although  they  obviously  can’t  begin  until  you  actually  have  customers
(so  it’s  discussed  in  the  “Grow”  section).  Viral  marketing  stimulates
referrals  of  customers  from  other  happy  customers.  Generate  attention
among  the  largest  audience  possible.  Consider  tools  like  YouTube  and
conferences you can attend and perhaps speak or promote at. Encourage
friends of the company and its team to invite their friends to learn more.
Consider  contests,  sweepstakes  and  promotions  to  drive  the  reach  of
viral efforts

Viral  products  help  sell  themselves.  Hotmail,  Gmail,  Facebook  and
many other web products end every customer communication by saying,
“Invite  a  friend  to  use  our  service.”  When  used,  it’s  powerful  and
virtually free viral marketing

like  Skype,
Network-effect  virality  boosts  usage  of  products 
Photobucket,  and  even  fax  machines.  You  can’t  talk  via  Skype  with  a
friend  who  doesn’t  have  it  or  fax  someone  without  a  fax  machine,  so
customers encourage others to join, expanding the network for their own
benefit. In the process, they get new users for the company

Customer referrals are the most “honest” source of
new business...

2. Get Customers to Send More Customers to the
Company

There are lots of different viral marketing tools and tactics that help you get
customers  to  refer  other  customers  to  the  company.  Here  are  the  six  most
powerful viral marketing techniques to consider:

Encourage customers to “like” the product on Facebook

Offer customers discounts or free trial offers to share with friends

Enable  customers  to  e-mail  their  friends  using  their  address  books  to
create mailing lists

 
Create contests or incentives to encourage Tweeting, “liking” and other
viral activities

Highlight  social-networking  action  buttons  on  the  site  to  make  viral
efforts easy

Encourage  bloggers  to  write  about  the  product,  and  reward  them  for
doing so

(The  customer  relationship  hypotheses  should  also  address  how  the

“Get, Keep and Grow” programs will be optimized once they’re under way.)

Key Resources Hypothesis

This brief identifies external resources critical to the company’s success and
how you’ll find and secure them.

Key resources fall into four main categories: physical, financial, human
and  intellectual property.  In  each  relevant  category,  create  a  list  of  the  key
resources you’ll require, what you expect to pay, and where you’ll go to find
them.
Physical  resources:  These  fall  into  two  types:  company  facilities  and
product/service  resources.  Examples  of  company  facilities  are  office  space
and  company  location  (near  mass  transit  to  more  easily  attract  lots  of
employees,  in  a  city  with  great  restaurants,  etc.).  Product/services  may
include a steady supply of superthin silicon wafers or iron ore or thousands of
feet  of  warehouse  space  or  specialized  lab  or  manufacturing  space.  Many
resources  are  capital-intensive,  particularly  where  physical  goods  are
concerned—manufacturing equipment, raw materials, and the like.

...many of the capital-intensive resources have

become utilities or can be outsourced.

In the 21st century, many of the capital-intensive equipment or services
resources  companies  used  to  need  to  physically  own  and  pay  for  have
become  utilities  or  can  be  outsourced.  For  example,  startups  that  need
computing and server capacity can buy processing power and storage, in the
cloud,  from  Amazon.com  and  many  others  (slashing  the  cost  of  a  software
startup  by  a  factor  of  10  or  more).  Manufacturing  that  used  to  be  a  capital-
intensive is now outsourced to Asia (with an equally significant reduction in
cost). IT and services can be done cheaper in India, etc.

Financial resources: Money is the lifeblood of startups. You stay in business
until  you  run  out  of  it.  This  book  is  about  how  to  reduce  startup  infant
mortality by making everything you do less wasteful and more cash-efficient.
There  are  tons  of  articles,  websites  and  entire  books  on  how  to  raise
money for a startup—and whom to raise it from. Friends and family, crowd
funding, angels, venture capital and corporate partners are the usual suspects.
But  don’t  overlook  government  grants  as  an  alternative  funding  source  for
new ventures. In the U.S., the grants.gov website is the first stop for a number
of  sources  such  as  SBA  (Small  Business  Administration)  and  SBIR  (Small
Business Innovation Research) grants.

Companies selling physical products have additional sources of capital:

Equipment lease line. This lets you finance the entire purchase price of
business  equipment  or  commercial  vehicles.  Typically  offered  by  a
bank, a lease line can be a great solution whether you need to preserve
working capital for other expenses or you’re in an expansion phase and
need financing

Factoring.  If  you’ve  sold  product  to  a  customer  who  takes  a  while  to
pay, you can sell your accounts receivable (i.e., the invoices) to a third
party  (called  a  factor)  at  a  discount.  It  provides  your  company  with
immediate cash

Vendor financing.  This  is  a  loan  arrangement  that  takes  place  between
your company and a vendor that supplies large volumes of their product

 
to you. The vendor lends money to you so you can buy products from it

Don’t forget the Human Resources

Human  resources  fall  into  three  categories:  personal  advice  (mentors,
teachers, and coaches), company advisors, and qualified employees.

Teachers,  coaches,  and  mentors  are  people  you’ll  need  to  help  you
advance your personal career. If you want to learn about a specific subject,
find a teacher. If you want to hone specific skills or reach an exact goal, hire
a coach. If you want to get smarter and better over the course of your career,
find someone who cares about you enough to be a mentor.

Advisors  are  people  you’ll  need  to  help  advance  your  company’s
success. Founders fail when they believe their visions are facts. Listening to
advice based on experience can help you sort through whether your vision is
a  hallucination.  Getting  an  advisory  board  (by  expanding  your  circle  of
accumulated  wisdom  beyond  your  investors)  is  so  important  that  it’s  an
explicit step in the Customer Development process.

Qualified  and  motivated  employees  are  the  difference  between  a  good
idea that never goes anywhere and a billion-dollar firm. Will your company
need dozens of specialized engineers or coders or designers as it grows? If so,
where  and  how  will  you  find  them?  Is  your  city  or  location  a  magnet  for
world-class  talent?  Is  there  a  shortage  of  talent?  Will  offshore  teams  be
required as the company scales, and how will you select and manage them?
In more specialized industries (think avionics, chip design, and biotech) this
may  be  even  more  challenging  if  scaling  the  team  quickly  is  important,
especially if the company is headquartered in a smaller or off-the-beaten-path
location to where you’ll have to relocate much of your talent pool in order to
employ  them.  If  you’re  in  a  part  of  the  country  or  the  world  where  the
number of potential employees is limited, how can you be more creative to
get  them?  Identify  what  the  human  resource  needs  are  now  and  what  they
will be two to three years later to be sure that growth won’t be constrained.

Intellectual Property is a Key Resource

Intellectual  property  gives  you  rights  to  stop  others  from  using  your
creativity.  The  assets  you  can  protect  may  include  your  “core  technology,”

such as source code, hardware designs, architecture, processes, and formulas.
Or  it  can  be  your  brand,  logo  or  domain  name.  You  can  protect  business
processes,  know-how,  customer 
information,  and  product  roadmaps.
Protection is also available for content such as music, books, and film. Some
of  these  assets  are  protected  automatically.  For  other  classes,  it’s  wise  and
sometimes mandatory to go through a registration, application or examination
process to get full protection.

Trademark: A trademark protects branding and marks and gives you the
right  to  prevent  others  from  using  “confusingly  similar”  marks  and  logos.
Trademark protection lasts as long as you use the mark. The more you use the
mark, the stronger your protection. Trademark registration is optional but has
significant advantages if approved.

Copyright: A copyright protects creative works of authorship, typically
songs, books, movies, photos, etc. Copyright gives you the right to prohibit
others  from  copying,  distributing  or  making  derivatives  of  your  work.  It
protects  “expressions”  of  ideas  but  doesn’t  protect  the  underlying  ideas.  (If
your  product  is  software,  copyright  is  also  used  to  prohibit  someone  from
stealing  your  software  and  reselling  it  as  machine  and/or  source  code.)
Copyright protection lasts practically forever. Registration is optional but is
required for suing for infringement.

TYPES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION

Types of Intellectual Property Protection (Table 3.5)

Contract: A contract is a binding legal agreement that’s enforceable in a

court  of  law.  There’s  no  official  registration  process;  you  have  whatever
protection  is  defined  in  the  contract  (e.g.,  a  nondisclosure  agreement  gives
you  certain  rights  to  protection  of  your  confidential  information).  The
protection lasts for the time period defined in the contract.

Patents:  A  patent  is  a  monopoly  the  government  grants  to  prohibit
others  from  making,  using  or  selling  your  invention,  even  when  the  other
party’s infringement is innocent or accidental.

Just  about  anything  can  be  patented—circuits,  hardware,  software,
applied algorithms, formulas, designs, user interfaces, applications, systems.
Scientific  principles  or  pure  mathematical  algorithms  may  not  be  patented.
Your invention must be “nonobvious.” The test for whether it’s nonobvious
is: given the prior art at the time of the invention, would a typical engineer 1)
identify the problem and 2) solve it with the invention? You must be “first to
file.”  You  must  file  in  the  U.S.  within  a  year  of  sale,  offer  for  sale,  public
disclosure  or  public  use.  Your  patent  application  has  to  include  a  written
description  with  details  of  the  claims  of  the  invention.  The  details  have  to
allow  others  to  duplicate  your  invention  from  your  description  and  have  to
use the “best mode” in describing critical techniques/technologies. And it has
to identify all prior “art,” or solutions to the problem.

Patent  protection  typically  lasts  15  to  20  years.  There  is  a  formal
application  and  examination  process.  Each  patent  filing  will  cost  your
company $20,000 to $50,000 and take one to four years to complete. Filing
of  patents  is  frequently  of  major  interest  to  people  funding  your  company.
(There’s something called a “provisional patent” that’s an alternative to a full
patent. It allows you to claim “first to file” and use the term patent pending.
Provisional patents get into the patent office quickly and cheaply. However,
they  automatically  expire  after  one  year,  and  no  patent  rights  are  granted.
Provisional patents are a good placeholder because they’re cheap to file and
don’t get in the way of your other patent efforts.)

Intellectual Property Creates Value

Intellectual  property  is  an  asset  for  your  company.  You  need  to  acquire,
protect  and  exploit  it.  You  can  map  out  an  intellectual  property  strategy  by
asking:

Who are the key players and technologies in its market(s)?

What are the most important ideas and inventions that need patents (or
provisional patents)? Start filing these early!

What are the important patent applications that come next?

Four Common Intellectual Property Mistakes
Startups Make

1.   Founders didn’t make a clean break with previous employer: Do your
employers or university own or have a claim on your inventions? It’s a
very subjective standard, and since startups don’t often have resources or
time to spend on lawsuits, large companies and universities may use
threats of litigation to ensure that you don’t take anything. Therefore the
best advice is to “take only memories.”

2.   Your startup cannot show that it owns its intellectual property: Take the

time to create a clear, well-documented chain of title (think lab
notebooks) to your intellectual property. If you’re using independent
contractors, make sure you have written agreements assigning work
created. Make sure you have Employee Invention Assignment
Agreements. (If you hire subcontractors or friends to do some work, get
assignment agreements as well.)

3.   You lost your patent rights due to filing delays/invention disclosures: In
the U.S., patent rights are forfeited if you wait more than a year after:
     •   disclosure in a printed publication (white paper, journal/conference

article, website)

     •   offer for sale in the U.S. (start of sales effort, price list, price quotation,
trade-show demonstration, any demonstration not under NDA, public
use in the U.S.)

     In most foreign countries, there is no one-year grace period.
4.   Your company grants “challenging” licenses to intellectual property:

Startups acquiring their first customers may give special licensing terms
in key markets, territories, etc.—e.g., a grant of “most favored nations”
license terms or other licensee-favorable economic terms. This can make
your intellectual property less valuable to future buyers of your company.
Or you may cut a deal that you can’t assign or transfer (or can’t get out
of) if you get acquired.

There May be Other Key Resources

Consider  other  external  business  elements  that  are  vital  to  the  company’s
success.  Celebrity  websites  need  a  steady  stream  of  “hot”  gossip  (this  one
shouldn’t be a problem) and  MarthaStewart.com wouldn’t be much without
Martha. Overstock.com would fail without a stream of good-quality discount
merchandise.

Dependency Analysis

The company’s dependency analysis basically answers the question “To sell
our product in volume, what has to happen that’s out of our control?” Things
out  of  a  company’s  control  can  include  other  technology  infrastructure  that
needs  to  emerge  (all  cell  phones  become  web-enabled,  fiber  optics  are  in
every  home,  electric  cars  are  selling  in  volume).  Dependencies  also  include
changes  in  consumers’  lifestyles  or  buying  behavior,  new  laws,  changes  in
economic conditions, and so on. Specify what needs to happen (let’s say the
widespread  adoption  of  telepathy),  when  it  needs  to  happen  (must  be
common among teens by 2020), and what happens if it doesn’t happen (the
product needs to use the Internet instead). Note the benchmarks you’ll use to
measure whether the change is happening when needed.

Identify  all  key  resources  in  this  hypothesis,  and  explain  how  the
company will make sure those key resources are readily available. Be sure to
identify  the  risks  of  their  unavailability,  as  well  as  alternatives  that  will
minimize impact on the company’s business model. Be careful not to confuse
partners (to be discussed next) with resources.

Partners Hypothesis

Key partners often provide capabilities, products, or services that the startup
either  can’t  or  would  prefer  not  to  develop  itself.  Batteries  for  a  flashlight
maker or design services for a website are two simple examples. But the most
famous is Apple and the iPod. Without the record labels providing music as
content,  the  iPod  and  iTunes  would  simply  be  another  hardware/software
player. The partners made the business model the juggernaut it is today.

The key-partners hypothesis names the essential partners your company
will require, along with the “value exchange” with each one (as in “we give
them money, they send us customers”). Partnerships generally fall into four
key  areas:  strategic  alliances;  “coopetition,”  or  cooperation  between
competitors;  joint  new  business  development  efforts;  and  key  supplier
relationships.

Think  of  this  hypothesis  as  a  simple  three-column  spreadsheet.  The
headings:  partner  name  (list  primary  and  runner-up  candidates),  “what  they
provide,”  and  “what  we  provide.”  Don’t  feel  bad  when  the  word  money
appears repeatedly in the third column. It’s fairly typical for startups, at least
in their early days.

Strategic  alliances,  generally  between  noncompetitive  companies,  can
often shorten the list of things your startup needs to build or provide to offer a
complete  product  or  service.  For  physical  products,  alliance  partners  might
provide  product  training,  installation  or  service,  peripherals  or  accessories,
whether  they’re  sold  under  your  startup’s  brand  name  or  not.  Specialized
service firms in many industries (law, accounting, engineering, IT) can often
market  a  wider  range  of  services  by  combining  their  services  with  those  of
other specialists. Alliances can also be used to broaden a startup’s footprint,
making  its  product  more  available  in  geographies  where  the  startup  itself

can’t support sales or service.

Joint  new  business  development  efforts  generally  happen  later  in  a
startup’s  life,  but  can  be  important  once  the  startup  has  established  its  own
identity and brand. Dell and HP sell lots of software and products made by
others,  but  seldom  do  so  until  they’re  confident  the  product  has  significant
consumer demand. Think of these as longer-term opportunities to investigate
as part of your customer discovery process.

“Coopetition” similarly happens later in a startup’s life, as a rule. It’s a
form of working with a direct competitor to share costs or market together.
New  York  City’s  “fashion  week”  is  a  good  example  of  coopetition  for
established  fashion  houses.  While  they’re  fiercely  competitive,  they  work
together to coordinate fashion show schedules so the top buyers can attend all
the key showings. Word for Mac is perhaps the greatest coopetition example
of all time, but both companies were well-established before the product was
developed and launched.

Key supplier relationships can mean life or death for a startup. Imagine
how tough it would be to churn out millions of iPhones without Foxconn, the
massive  Apple  manufacturing  partner  in  China,  or  to  make  Ben  &  Jerry’s
famed  Cherry  Garcia  without  an  uninterrupted  supply  of  delicious  cherries.
Suppliers  can  be  instrumental  to  any  company’s  success,  but  tight,  flexible
partnerships can be absolutely critical. Many startups outsource a variety of
“back  office”  functions,  ranging  from  warehousing  and  fulfillment  of
physical  goods  to  HR,  payroll,  benefits  and  accounting.  These  outsource
suppliers  act  as  extensions  of  the  company  that  leverage  the  suppliers’
expertise to improve the startup’s efficiency and cost structure.

Will  the  partner  flex  its  delivery  times,  order-size  requirements,  credit
terms  or  even  its  price  in  your  startup’s  early  days?  How  will  the  partner
ensure  a  steady  supply  that  rises  (quickly,  we  hope)  or  falls  in  line  with
customer  demand?  Identify  the  key  suppliers  in  this  hypothesis,  along  with
what  you’ll  need  from  them.  You’ll  visit  with  them  later  to  validate  this
hypothesis  and  understand  your  role  and  theirs  in  forging  a  mutually
beneficial relationship.

Revenue and Pricing Hypothesis

The  revenue  and  pricing  brief  may  well  be  the  toughest  of  all,  but  it’s
critically important, since it ensures that the business model makes financial
sense.  In  a  way,  this  brief  is  elegantly  simple,  since  it  asks  only  four
questions:

1.  How many of these things will we sell?

2.  What’s the revenue model?

3.  How much will we charge?

4.  Does this add up to a business that’s worth doing?

Revenue Sources (Figure 3.18)

While some of the issues differ from channel to channel, the process of
computing your company’s revenue is fundamentally the same, regardless of
channel. The good news: much of the work for this brief is already complete.

Question 1: How Many Will We Sell?

In the physical channel, companies generate revenue by selling their product,
collecting  revenue  either  as  a  one-time  sale,  via  time  payments,  or  through
such  financial  tools  as  leasing  or  subscriptions.  They  also  solicit  referrals
from current customers, often rewarding customers for referring others.

Market  size  and  market  share  hypotheses,  which  should  translate  into
the  anticipated  number  of  customers  (as  in  10  percent  of  a  million-
person market = 100,000 customers)

Channel hypotheses, along with estimates of their volume potential and
channel costs

Be  sure  to  include  (subtract,  really)  the  channel’s  cost  of  sales,  which
can be enormous, since the company only gets to “count,” or keep, net
revenue  received  after  channel  costs  are  subtracted.  (Enthusiastic
entrepreneurs make this mistake far too often)

Question 2: How Much Do We Charge? (Pricing
Tactics)

This is a two-part question. Part one assesses the costs of doing business. For
physical  products,  this  is  often  far  more  important.  If  you’re  selling  canned
peas or microwave relay towers, there’s a clear, sizeable cost of the physical
product itself: parts, assembly, packaging, shipping, and more.

In  business-to-business  and  some  consumer  sales,  other  issues  warrant
consideration, such as total cost of operation (if rent is high or staff is huge,
or the electric bill is a high component of product cost).

Part two of the “how much will we charge” question is simple: “what’s
the price?” You will start testing your pricing hypothesis later in discovery,
but first there’s a bit more work to do.

A  good  pricing  model  recognizes  Market  Type,  accommodates
manufacturing  costs,  the  value  the  product  delivers,  market  beliefs,  and
competitive  prices.  It  also  charges  “as  much  as  the  market  will  bear”  to
maximize  profits.  For  best  results,  start  with  a  deep  understanding  of

competitive pricing.

Startups  have  lots  of  choices  in  selecting  their  pricing  models.  Among

the most popular pricing models:

Value pricing: Based on the value delivered by the product rather than
the  cost  itself.  Investing  or  accounting  software  tools,  unique  patented
products and pharmaceuticals can sometimes optimize profits with this
model

Competitive  pricing:  Positions  the  product  against  others  in  its
competitive set, typically in existing markets

Volume pricing: Designed to encourage multiple purchases or users, in
situations ranging from office supplies to SAAS software

Portfolio  pricing:  For  companies  with  multiple  products  and  services,
each  with  a  different  cost  and  utility.  Here  the  objective  is  to  make
money with the portfolio, some with high markups and some with low,
depending on competition, lock-in, value delivered, and loyal customers

The  “razor/razor  blade”  model:  Part  of  the  product  is  free  or
inexpensive, but it pulls through highly profitable repeat purchases on an
ongoing basis. (Think of the cost of ink-jet printers compared with the
cost of the ink.) Often challenging for startups due to the upfront cost

Subscription: While now thought of as a software strategy, the Book of
the Month Club pioneered this for physical products

Leasing:  Lowers  the  entry  cost  for  customers.  Provides  constant
earnings over a period of years

Product-based  pricing:  Based  on  a  multiple  of  actual  product  cost.
Usually 
for  maximum
revenue/profit versus volume)

for  physical  goods. 

(Typically  priced 

Two Business-to-Business Pricing Issues

Total Cost of Ownership/Adoption (TCO): More an issue in business than
in consumer sales, the TCO analysis estimates the total cost to customers of
buying  and  using  the  product.  For  business  products,  do  customers  need  to
buy  a  new  computer  to  run  the  software?  Do  they  need  training  to  use  the

product? Do other physical or organizational changes need to happen? What
will  deployment  across  a  whole  company  cost?  For  consumer  products,
measure  the  cost  of  “adopting”  the  product  to  fit  consumer  needs.  Do
customers need to change their lifestyle? Do they need to change any part of
their purchasing or usage behavior? Do they need to throw away something
they use today?

Return  on  Investment  (ROI):  When  setting  prices  for  sales  to
corporations,  your  company  may  have  to  prove  to  them  the  purchase  price
was “worth it,” or that they got “a good deal,” which may be less about price
than  about  the  total  return  on  their  investment.  As  a  rule,  companies  focus
more on ROI than consumers do, partly because of the size of and oversight
on  large  transactions.  ROI  represents  customers’  expectation  of  their
investment  measured  against  goals  such  as  problem-solving,  productivity,
time,  money  and  resources.  For  consumers,  return  often  includes  status  or
style and sometimes even just plain fun.

When  selling  to  businesses,  prepare  a  hypothetical  ROI  in  advance  of
initial  customer  meetings.  (This  is  often  a  good  subject  for  a  helpful  white
paper.) If the solution doesn’t return a meaningful multiple ROI, sales may be
difficult.  That  $50,000  robot  vacuum  system  as  a  replacement  for  a  $5,000
annual  cleaning  bill  may  be  a  tough  sell,  especially  after  a  good  job  on  the
TCO  (maintenance,  electricity,  parts  and  more)  as  part  of  the  ROI
computation.

Question 3: Do Revenues Point to a Business Worth
Doing?

You have to do more than multiply the volume by the average selling price to
get the answer to this question, but don’t worry—this answer doesn’t need to
be precise just yet. Remember, the goal of customer discovery is to refine a
business model enough to test it on a larger scale in the next step, customer
validation. So at this point, with a rough view of the gross revenue and all the
fixed  and  variable  costs  involved,  make  a  rough  computation  of  the
following:

Is the revenue adequate to cover costs in the short term?

Will the revenue grow materially if not dramatically over time?

Does the profitability get better as the revenues get bigger?

Again,  this  is  a  rough,  back-of-the-envelope  calculation  used  only  to
decide  if  what  you  found  in  discovery  moves  your  forward  to  customer
validation. It’s not an accounting exercise.

Remember, you have limited resources. Focus first on the one key, big
source  of  revenue  before  expanding  into  secondary  sources,  which  can  be
distracting to the company.

Two More Revenue Issues to Consider

Distribution  Channel  Affects  Revenue  Streams.  Calculating  revenue  is
easy for a product sold directly by your own sales force: You simply deduct
any discount you gave the customer from the list price of the product. When
you  sell  through  indirect  channels,  revenue  calculations  might  be  harder.
Selling  to  Walmart  is  wonderful,  but  most  retails  channels  have  “return
rights.”  (If  your  product  doesn’t  move  off  their  shelf,  you  have  to  take  it
back.) Are you selling to OEMs where the discount is steep and the revenue
to your company doesn’t appear until the OEM begins selling in volume?
Consider Lifetime Value: How much will the customer ultimately spend not
just  in  the  first  sale  but  over  the  life  of  his  or  her  relationship  with  the
company?  SAAS  software,  dating  websites,  and  online  gaming  focus  on
customer  lifetime  value.  Customers  can  sign  up  for  salesforce.com,  for
example,  sometimes  for  a  few  dollars  a  month,  but  the  company  no  doubt
spends  several  times  that  amount  to  attract  and  sign  a  new  user.  Why?
Because  it  understands  that  the  average  salesforce.com  subscription  lasts
many months, making the new customer worth a multiple of the monthly cost
—provided,  of  course,  that  the  company  stays  in  business  long  enough  to
collect  the  revenue.  (On  the  other  hand,  the  lifetime  value  of  a  demolition
contractor’s typical customer often approximates his first invoice.)

Customer lifetime value dramatically affects revenue stream and pricing
strategy,  online  or  off,  although  other  than  magazine  and  newspaper
subscriptions,  which  are  declining  rapidly,  there  are  scant  few  subscription
products beyond gym memberships among physical products.

Final Draft of a Business Model Hypothesis (Figure 3.19)

Tie the Components of Revenue Together in a
Hypothesis

Revenue stream and pricing interact with the value proposition, the channel,
customer  relationships,  and  the  other  business  model  components.  That
means  there’ll  be  lots  of  iterating  and  pivoting.  The  revenue  stream
hypothesis will be tested repeatedly before it’s cast in stone, first in customer
discovery  discussions  and  again  with  more  customers  as  part  of  customer
validation. When the draft of the revenue stream brief is complete, re-validate
it to see that the math adds up. Ultimately, only one answer matters: can we
generate enough revenue, profits and growth to make this business worth our
time and energy?

Completing the Hypothesis Development Process:

This brief completes the company’s only large-scale paperwork exercise. The
action  now  moves  outside  the  building  so  you  can  start  to  understand  what
potential  customers  need  and  to  qualify  or  refine  the  initial  hypothesis
assumptions. But before doing that:

Convene a team meeting where a large copy of the latest business model

canvas and briefs are taped to a wall. A summary of each of the briefs
should be adjacent to the canvas

All participants should read each of the business model briefs

Look  at  the  summaries  on  the  canvas,  read  the  details  in  the  briefs,
discuss 
look  for  obvious  conflicts  or
inconsistencies.

them  as  a 

team,  and 

Founders,  product  development,  engineering  and  operations  teams
should again validate cost assumptions and changes

Return to the first hypotheses developed to be certain there’s no conflict
from one to the next. Does the sales channel make sense, for example, in
light of the pricing, need for installation, etc.? Will fewer customers still
adequately fund overhead and development?

Review and agree on the final versions of each hypothesis

Make certain the hypothesis summaries agree with the summary in the
appropriate business model box

Update the business model as appropriate

Now it’s time to move ahead and get out of the office, where customers

and facts live.

Customer Discovery, Phase Two: “Get Out
of the Building” to Test the Problem: “Do
People Care?”

PHASE 2 GETS  THE  TEAM  “OUT  OF  THE  BUILDING” to test the problem and to
answer three key questions:

Do we really understand the customer’s problem?

Do  enough  people  really  care  enough  about  the  problem  for  this  to
become a huge business?

And will they care enough to tell their friends?

The next section, Phase 3, will test to see whether the product offers a
compelling solution to customers who have said there’s a problem. When the
“problem”  and  “solution”  questions  are  answered  with  a  resounding  “yes,”
product/market  fit  is  achieved  and  it’s  time  to  move  on  to  customer
validation.

This phase includes five key steps:

designing experiments for customer tests

preparing for customer contacts and engagement

testing  customers  understanding  of  the  problem  and  assessing  its
importance to customers

gaining understanding of customers

capturing competitive and market knowledge

As  this  phase  gets  under  way,  here’s  a  reminder  of  the  key  rules  from

the Customer Development Manifesto in Chapter 1:

Customer discovery is done by the founders

Hypotheses require testing. Testing requires experiments to be designed

Web  surveys  are  nice,  but  always  correlate  them  with  face-to-face
customer feedback, even for web businesses

Customer  meetings  aren’t  about  learning  whether  customers  love  the
product,  at  least  not  yet.  They’re  about  understanding  the  problem  and
how  urgently  your  potential  customers  need  to  solve  that  problem.
You’ll focus more on the product itself once you’re certain the problem
it solves is big enough to create a market worth going after

Initial hypotheses rarely survive feedback without iterations or pivots

Design Tests and Pass/Fail Experiments

At  this  point,  your  Phase  One  business  model  hypotheses  are  still  just
“guesses.” In this phase you’ll turn those hypotheses into facts by getting out
of the building and testing them in front of customers.

Here’s  an  easy  way  to  visualize  this:  think  of  a  three-layer  business
model.  The  bottom  layer  represents  your  initial  vision  of  the  startup.  The
second  layer  outlines  the  detailed  hypotheses  you  just  developed  in  Phase
One.  The  third  layer  shows  the  tests  you’ll  conduct  to  verify  and  measure
each  hypothesis,  turning  guesses  into  facts  as  you  do,  so  that  the  business
model can be verified and measured.

Business Model/Hypotheses/Tests (Figure 4.1)

But  how  do  you  test?  Rule  number  6  of  the  Customer  Development
Manifesto  says  to  design experiments  and  Rule 9  says  to  do  it  with  speed,
tempo and fast cycle time. So the first step in running a test of your business
model  hypotheses  is  to  design  simple  pass/fail  experiments  for  each  test.
Next you run the tests, and then you gather the data and not only try to learn
something  from 
insight.  The
Hypotheses/Experiment/Test/Insight loop is shown in Figure 4.2 below.

Hypothesis/Design Experiment/Test/Insight (Figure 4.2)

Regardless of whether it’s a physical or web/mobile product, Customer
Development experiments are short, simple, objective pass/fail tests. You’re
looking for a strong signal in the noise. The pass/fail tests give you a “good
enough” signal to proceed.

Start by asking yourself, “What do I want to learn?” Then ask, “What’s
the simplest pass/fail test I can run to learn?” Finally, think about, “How do I
design a pass/fail experiment to run this simple test?”

For  example,  a  Customer  Relationships  hypothesis  for  a  physical

product  may  have  assumed  that  for  every  10  sales  calls  three  people  would
move into active consideration of buying. The experiment might be as simple
as making the same presentation to 30 prospects and having the experiment
“pass” by coming away with nine or more orders or letters of intent.

Tests

One  of  the  things  that  trips  up  engineering  founders  is  thinking  that  these
hypotheses tests have to be actual code, hardware or the real product. Most of
the  time  you  can  mock  up  the  web  page  or  create  a  demo  or  physical
prototype to elicit valuable learning. Nor do the tests involve large sums of
money or large amounts of time. When you get a strong “grab it out of your
hands” on, say, from four of your first ten customers, it’s OK to stop the test
and declare it a success. The goal is speed, learning and looking for a global
maximum (not a local maximum).

What’s a global maximum? Let’s say you run a free trial offer for three
days on your great new weekend getaway website and you get 50, then 60,
then  80  signups  in  the  first  three  days.  You  might  say,  “Wow,  80,  that’s
great,” and end the test. But on day four, the sun comes out. Had you run the
test  for  only  two  more  days,  you  might  have  discovered  your  “global
maximum,” 500 signups a day. Only experience and good guesswork can tell
you how long to run a test, and while shorter is always better, be sure you’ve
given yourself the opportunity to reach your global maximum.

Global Maximum versus Local Maximum Response Rates (Figure 4.3)

The  next  steps  in  Phases  2  and  3  and  in  customer  validation  provide

details on how to set up tests for both web/mobile and physical products.

Insight

The goal of these experiments/tests is not just to collect customer data. Nor is
it to simply get “pass” on the pass/fail experiments. And it’s not just to learn
something, though we hope you will.

It’s 

something  more  profound, 

intangible  and  what  makes
entrepreneurship in the end still an art. It’s the fact that you’re looking past
the  data  –  you’re  looking  for  insight.  Did  you  get  thrown  out  of  sales  calls
time and again but you remembered someone said, “Too bad you don’t sell x,
because we can use a ton of those.”

Prepare for Customer Contacts

The  next  step  in  qualifying  your  business  model  hypotheses  is  to  leave  the
safe confines of your office and conference room and venture out to the real
world, where the people who will pay your bills live. Regardless of whether
you’re selling to large corporations or consumers at home, your friendly first
contacts  are  the  people  who  will  start  your  education  about  customers  and
their problems. Better yet, they may become your customers.

Start with 50 Target Customers

The first step in this phase will be the hardest: contacting potential customers
who  don’t  know  you,  persuading  them  to  give  you  some  of  their  time,  and
looking them in the eye.

At this stage, you’re less interested in big names and
titles or the “exactly right” consumers.

Start by gathering a list of 50 potential customers you can test your ideas
on.  Fifty  names  sounds  like  a  lot,  but  as  you’ll  soon  see,  you’ll  go  through
them quickly. A solid discovery effort will usually involve 10 to 15 customer
visits  a  week,  and  getting  face-to-face  with  50  people  will  probably  require
contacting  200  customers  or  more.  Where  do  the  names  come  from?  Start
with  the  people  you  know  directly.  Next,  expand  the  list  by  scouring  your
cofounders’  and  employees’  address  books,  social-network  lists  (Facebook,

 
Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, Jigsaw, etc.). Then call in every favor possible,
from  friends,  investors,  founders,  lawyers,  recruiters,  accountants  to  add
names  to  your  list.  Finally,  use  conference-attendee  lists,  trade  media,  and
any other source you can think of.

Even if you’re selling to businesses, right now your customers’ titles and
their  levels  in  the  organization  are  irrelevant.  And  if  you’re  selling  to
consumers, whether they currently have the slightest interest in your product
or not is also inconsequential. What matters is what you will learn from them.
At  this  stage,  you’re  less  interested  in  big  names  and  titles  or  the  “exactly
right”  consumers.  You’re  interested  in  finding  people  who  will  give  you
some of their time and who you think even loosely fit the profile embedded
in  your  customer  hypotheses.  (In  fact,  calling  on  high-level  execs  now  is  a
waste of a great lead. You really have no idea what you’re saying yet, with
nothing  more  than  untested  guesses,  and  will  regret  making  the  call.  Wait
until your business model and story stop changing on a weekly basis.)

While you’re building your contact list, simultaneously begin to develop
an  innovators  list.  What’s  an  innovator?  These  are  the  most  innovative
companies,  departments  in  companies,  or  individuals  in  your  field  who  are
smart,  well-respected  and  usually  out  in  front  of  a  subject.  For  consumer
products,  they  may  be  the  “gadget  freaks”  everyone  asks  for  advice  or  the
group of people others look to for help spotting a trend. You’ll use this list
two  ways.  First,  you  need  to  find  and  meet  with  the  visionaries  who  are
known  to  “get”  new  ideas.  Unfortunately  most  people  view  innovation  as  a
dangerous  virus  that  must  be  kept  out  of  their  companies,  while  few  others
look forward to hearing about and understanding what’s new. The few are the
people  to  talk  to.  Second,  your  innovators  list  will  give  you  a  great  contact
list of industry influencers and potential advisory board members.

It’s hard if you’ve never called on someone you don’t know, but it’s a

lot easier if you carefully prepare a reference story that gets you in the door.

Develop a Reference Story

The first step in customer contacts is coming up with a reference story.

A reference story emphasizes the problems you’re trying to solve, why

it’s important to solve them, and the solution you’re building.

The  story  typically  starts  with  an  introduction:  “Hi  this  is  Bob  at
NewBankingProduct  Inc.  I  was  referred  to  you  by  (insert  helpful  reference

name  here),  who  said  you  were  the  smartest  person  in  the  (name  your
market/industry).”  Now  give  the  potential  customer  a  reason  to  see  you:
“We’re  starting  a  company  to  solve  the  long-teller-line  problem,  and  we’re
building our new Instanteller software, but I don’t want to sell you anything. I
just  want  twenty  minutes  of  your  time  to  understand  if  you  have  the  long-
teller-line  problem  and  learn  how  you  and  your  company  solve  your  own
teller problem.”

The best introduction to a prospect is through a
peer.

What’s  in  it  for  your  contact?  “I  thought  you  might  give  me  some
insight  about  this  problem,  and  in  exchange  I’ll  be  happy  to  tell  you  where
the technology in this industry is going.” Exhale.

Obviously, you’ll need to vary and tweak the story, but the goal remains
the same: get meetings scheduled (you can do this via e-mail but it’s a lot less
effective).  This  may  sound  easy  on  paper,  but  if  you  aren’t  a  professional
salesperson,  it  can  be  very  hard.  Nobody  likes  calling  people  they  don’t
know. First-time practitioners of customer discovery stare at the phone, walk
around it, pick it up, and put it down without calling. But eventually you have
to “bite the bullet” and place the calls. And you know what? There’s nothing
more  satisfying  than  hearing  a  potential  customer  say,  “Why,  yes,  that’s
exactly the problem we have. I can spare twenty minutes to chat—why don’t
you come in Tuesday.” Yes!

Start the Appointment-setting Process

First, a few pointers:

The best introduction to a prospect, when you can manage it, is through
a peer within his or her company. For consumer products, it can be just
as challenging—how do you get hold of someone you don’t know? But
the same technique can be used: a reference from someone the prospect
knows

Start  with  an  introductory  e-mail  or  LinkedIn,  Twitter  or  Facebook

 
message—preferably sent by whoever gave you the contact—explaining
the reason for the call that will follow and why the time spent in the visit
will provide value to the customer

Always start by mentioning the referral source, as in, “Steve Blank said
I should call”

Tell them that the meeting is not a sales call and that someone said they
were  the  smartest  person  in  the  industry  and  you  want  to  get  their
feedback.

Ask for a short amount of time: “I just need 15 minutes of your time.”
(You’ll get more)

Don’t talk product or features. Explain that the goal is an understanding
of the problems or issues in the market or product category, and explain
why the person’s time will be well used

Sometimes  the  best  “meeting”  is  a  friendlier,  less  “threatening”  cup  of
coffee  that’s  clearly  intended  to  be  an  information  exchange  and  not  a
hard-boiled  sales  pitch.  Guests  will  be  more  likely  to  accept  and  often
more relaxed, receptive, and open to talking

One of the mistakes entrepreneurs make is
confusing motion with action.

Companies that succeed in this phase often spend an entire week setting
up the meetings and at least several weeks conducting them. It’s a small price
to  pay  when  compared  with  the  years  the  team  will  spend  driving  toward
success. Each founder needs to have at least 10 (yes, 10) conversations a day
until you book enough meetings to fill your calendar.

One of the mistakes entrepreneurs make in this step is confusing motion
with action. Motion is a sent e-mail, a left voice-mail message or a note on
LinkedIn.  Action  is  a  two-way  conversation.  So  10  conversations  may
require 25 e-mails, voice mails, Tweets, etc. Keep calling until the schedule’s
booked with three customer visits a day. Get used to being turned down, but
always  ask,  “If  you’re  too  busy,  who  else  should  I  talk  to?”  It’s  helpful  to
keep hit-rate statistics (were any lead sources or job titles better than others?).

 
The same approach works for consumer products. As a rule of thumb, every
50  calls  should  yield  five  to  10  visits.  Before  going  out,  plan  the  call  from
icebreaker to conclusion and rehearse.

Build a master calendar of booked appointments and assign members of
the founding team to each one. Geography, proximity and logistics challenge
the time efficiency. Research the company in advance to personalize the visit
as  much  as  possible.  Don’t  expect  every  customer  to  be  able  to  react
thoughtfully to every question or have a valid opinion on every aspect of the
need  or  problem.  Instead,  plan  to  assemble  a  mosaic  of  answers  that
ultimately provide depth of feedback on every question on your list.

Test Understanding of the Problem and Assess Its
Importance

With your customer meetings scheduled, it’s time to get out of the building
and measure how serious and important the customer problems, passions or
needs  are  in  the  customer’s  eyes.  Are  you  solving  an  urgent  “hair-on-fire”
problem or something that it would be nice to fix “someday?” Obviously, one
of those suggests a far larger market opportunity.

Develop a Problem Presentation

In contrast with a product presentation, a problem presentation is designed to
elicit  information  from  customers.  The  presentation  summarizes  your
hypotheses  about  customers’  problems  and  about  how  they’re  solving  the
problem  today.  It  also  offers  some  potential  solutions,  to  test  whether  your
assumptions are correct. This presentation is your icebreaker when you meet
customers. (You may have to do this for each “side” in multi-sided markets,
where the issues differ for buyers and sellers/users and payers.)

In contrast with a product presentation, a problem
presentation is designed to elicit information from
customers.

Developing  a  problem  presentation  is  easy.  Your  hypotheses  about
customer  problems  and  their  solutions  were  articulated  in  the  value

 
proposition  hypothesis  in  Phase  1.  Put  these  assumptions  into  slides.
Consider something as simple as a single-slide presentation (see Figure 4.4)
listing  the  perceived  problems  first,  the  current  solutions  in  Column  2,  and
your proposed solution in Column 3.

Customer Problem Presentation (Figure 4.4)

Hopefully you’ll never get to use your presentation. Your goal is to get
the  customers  to  talk,  not  you.  This  is  the  biggest  idea  in  Customer
Development. The real goal of the problem presentation is for you to capture
your hypotheses about what you believe, but unlike an existing company, you
aren’t trying to convince anyone you’re right. You’re there to listen.

Get the customers to talk, not you.

The Problem Meeting

When you have the slide done, be prepared to present it using a whiteboard or
simply  one-on-one  across  a  table.  Remember,  though,  that  “presenting”  in
this  context  really  means  inviting  the  customers’  responses.  So,  after
describing  your  assumed  list  of  problems  in  column  1,  pause  and  ask  the
customers  what  they  think  the  problems  are,  whether  you’re  missing  any
problems,  how  they  would  rank  the  problems,  and  which  are  must-solve
rather than nice-to-solve. You’ve hit the jackpot when the customer tells you
they will do anything to solve the problem.

The  presentation  must  encourage  discussion.  Most  people  enter  a
meeting room expecting to be “talked at,” especially in a first meeting with

 
someone  viewed  as  a  potential  vendor.  When  using  slides,  at  least  half  the
slides  should  create  a  “pause”  that  requires  more  than  a  yes/no  response.
Better still, use no slides and perhaps a printed handout or two instead. These
kinds of questions stimulate a problem discussion:

We think these are the five top problems facing the industry. How would
you rank them as they affect your company?

If  you  have  three  major  problems  to  solve  (in  this  area)  in  the  year
ahead, what are they and why do they make the “top three”?

How does your company evaluate new products? (price? performance?
features?)

What if a customer tells you that the issues you thought were important
really  aren’t?  Instead  of  feeling  as  if  you’ve  failed,  realize  you’ve  just
obtained  great  data.  While  it  may  not  be  what  you  wanted  to  hear,  it’s
wonderful to have that knowledge early on.

Summarize this discussion by asking two questions: “What’s the biggest
pain in how you work? If you could wave a magic wand and change anything
about  what  you  do,  what  would  it  be?”  (These  are  the  “IPO  questions.”
Understand the answers to these questions and your startup is going public.)
Casually  ask,  “How  much  does  this  problem  cost  you  (in  terms  of  lost
revenue, lost customers, lost time, frustration, etc.)?” You’ll use this number
later in the customer validation step, when you develop a presentation.

Understand How They Solve the Problem Today

With agreement on the problems and their cost, you can display Column 2 (in
Figure 4.4), the solutions available today. Again you pause, ask the customers
what they think the solutions to the problem are, whether you’re missing any
problems,  and  how  they  would  rank  the  viability  of  the  existing  solutions.
What you’re looking for here is an understanding of how customers solve this
problem  today  or  how  they  think  others  do.  If  the  problem  is  painful  or
important enough, you’ll get interesting answers. While you’re at it, another
critical  piece  of  information  is  who  shares  these  problems.  Are  there  other
consumers who do x or y? Other people in the same company? Others in an
industry? Others with the same title? A set of people with common problems

equals a common value proposition. This means you can describe the value
of your product in a message that’s understood across a broad audience.

“If you could wave a magic wand and change
anything, what would it be?”

Finally,  for  both  corporate  and  consumer  products,  introduce  the
company’s solution (not a set of features but only the big idea) in Column 3.
Pause and watch the customers’ reactions. Do they even understand what the
words mean? Is the solution evident enough that they say, “If you could do
that, all my problems would be solved?” Alternatively, do they say, “What do
you mean?” Then do you have to explain it for 20 minutes and they still don’t
understand? Ask how your solution compares with the current solutions you
just discussed. Once again, the point is not to deliver a sales pitch but to get
their reaction and a healthy discussion.

Of course, what you learn from these discussions depends on what sticks
after  the  meeting.  Responses  tend  to  blur  together,  so  it’s  helpful  to  take
hypothesis  briefs  along  on  visits.  Look  at  the  entire  set.  Before  each  call,
shorten the list to “What are the three most important things I need to learn in
the  call?”  Get  at  least  those  three  questions  covered.  Take  notes  and  listen
actively.  Over  time,  as  response  to  key  issues  crystallizes,  begin  to  ask
different questions.

Think  about  ending  a  meeting  with  “Who  are  the  three  other  smart
people like you I should talk to?” I want my contact list to always be getting
bigger. Another favorite closer is “What is it that I should have asked you?”
The  answers  have  been  known  to  keep  meetings  running  for  another  half-
hour.

The Problem Meeting in a New Market

Using the problem presentation can be daunting in new markets, which lack
context,  since  it’s  tough  to  solicit  feedback  on  a  problem  folks  don’t
recognize or realize they have. The classic (and tired) example of this is the
likelihood  that  if  Henry  Ford  had  asked  customers  what  they  wanted,  they
would have said, “A faster horse.” Unlike an existing market where there are

 
customers who can name the basis of competition (features, price, needs, etc.)
new markets have no existing customers. But that doesn’t mean you should
sit in your office and simply build your vision.

Always ask, “What should I have asked?”

Problem  meetings  in  new  markets  use  the  problem–and-solution
presentation to inform an entrepreneur’s vision, not to specify features. In a
new  market,  customer  responses  should  provide  additional  insight,  not
numerical  data.  In  a  new  market  one  of  the  warning  signs  that  you  may  be
hallucinating rather than have a vision is if you can’t find any earlyvangelists
who share your vision. (They share it by giving you an order, not a pat on the
back.)

Collect Information on Everything

Before  concluding  the  visit,  ask  yourself,  “What  else  can  I  learn?”  Never
leave  meetings,  even  bad  ones,  without  learning  three  new  things.  I  ask  a
series of seemingly innocuous questions. What conferences or trade shows do
they  attend?  What  blogs,  journals,  and  magazines  do  they  read?  Who’s  the
best  salesperson  they’ve  ever  seen?  How  do  they  hear  about  new  ideas?
Imagine asking these questions across 100 or more contacts and you can see
yourself building a “customer order of battle”—a deep understanding of who
they  are  and  how  to  reach  them.  Keep  detailed  records  of  all  responses.
Develop a Customer Discovery Scorecard.

Avoid the Big-Company Meeting Trap

There’s  a  special  trap  to  watch  out  for  when  you  call  on  big  companies,
where  employees  tend  to  attend  meetings  en  masse,  Clearly  detrimental  to
open,  freewheeling  conversations  with  potential  earlyvangelists  that  could
have been rich in feedback. To ensure maximum feedback at big companies:

Arrange  one-on-one  meetings  with  key  targets  (decision-makers,  key
influencers,  and  heavy  users)  before  and/or  after  group  meetings  to

 
gather individual feedback

Try to get the “big boss” alone since others are often reluctant to speak
up when he or she is in the meeting. They may also defer to him or her,
minimizing important “outlier” feedback

A  possible  approach  to  discovery  with  a  big  company  is  to  bring  your
entire startup “brain trust” to a peer-to-peer meeting with the company’s
leadership  so  the  two  senior  teams  have  a  forum  to  discuss  the
opportunity

Always state the goal upfront: we want a better understanding of how a
trendsetter  or  industry  leader  confronts  problems  or  challenges  that
might be solved by a new product (flattery never hurts)

Amalgamate and “Score” the Customer Data

When the first “out of the building” problem phase is complete, summarize
the  data,  in  a  Customer  Discovery  Scorecard  (Figure  4.5).  The  scorecard
provides a sense of whether there’s enough customer excitement around the
product  to  warrant  further  forward  motion.  The  analysis  should  help  gauge
whether  the  right  people  were  contacted  and  whether  enough  earlyvangelist
candidates  were  identified.  “Weight”  the  data  to  adjust  the  findings’
importance to company goals. In the process, some customers will be pursued
aggressively,  others  will  be  put  on  “hold”  until  the  product  becomes
mainstream, and some will be abandoned.

Don’t lose or ignore outlier comments. They may lead to new features or
different ways of selling or provide other suggested iterations for the business
model.  Look  at  both  the  summary  data  and  specific  or  unusual  comments
from prospective customers.

Sample Customer Discovery Scorecard (Figure 4.5)

The  scorecard  rates  six  customers’  views  on  a  new  industrial  battery,
using  a  score  of  1  to  3,  with  3  being  highest.  Rating  checkpoints  in  this
example include:

“Excited” and “urgent need” are self-explanatory.

“Business-Impact”  reflects  how  important  or  transformative  will  the
adoption  of  this  technology  be  on  the  customer?  Nice  to  have?  Impacts  a
division? Changes their entire business model?

“Work-around,”  indicates  that  the  customer  has  been  solving  the  problem
with a home-grown solution.

“120 day”  indicates  how  likely  it  is  that  the  customer  will  sign  a  purchase
order  in  120  days.  Since  this  hypothetical  company  requires  more  funding
within  six  months,  120-day  purchases  are  double-weighted  (thus  the  120×2
column).

“Key  decider,”  indicating  that  the  conversation  was  with  an  empowered
buyer.

The  actual  scorecard  might  have  tens,  hundreds  or  thousands  of  lines,
but on this sample scorecard we’re just looking at a handful of customers. If
the  six  are  representative,  our  sample  scorecard  suggests  the  need  for  more
discovery data. Why? Only Customers A and B reflect both excitement, and
an  urgent  need,  for  the  product.  Of  those,  only  Customer  A  is  an

earlyvangelist candidate, experiencing enough pain to attempt a work-around
solution. Even then, Customer A’s score is only 18 of a potential 21 points,
and he reflects uncertainty about buying the product within 120 days, neither
of  which  are  signs  of  a  rabid  enthusiasm  for  the  product.  Some  other
observations:

Customer A is likely to buy within the 120-day goal period

Forget Customer E for now, since excitement is poor despite the urgent
need. And conversations with a decision-maker are a long way off, as is
a buying decision

Approach  Customer  C  in  hopes  of  meeting  the  decision-maker,  and
request another meeting with the decision-maker at Customer B

Don’t  abandon  any  of  the  customers,  since  each  acknowledges  some
significant need for the product. Those not selected for further discovery
should be kept on ice and made part of the pipeline at a later date. Take
your time calling back Customer F

Develop a viable mechanism that properly weights
the key issues.

The average scores are also informative. The high “urgent need” average
suggests there may be non-product problems, such as an inadequate problem
presentation, ROI justification, or the need to reach higher-level folks during
customer  discovery  in  general,  since  everyone  recognizes  a  need  for  the
product  but  few  are  eager  to  buy.  The  poor  120-day  score  reinforces  the
likelihood  that  product  benefits  weren’t  described  well  and  that  the
price/value  message  was  unclear,  or  perhaps  the  price/value  itself  needs  a
pivot or an iteration.

Every  product  has  a  different  set  of  variables  to  consider  and  score  in
aggregating  and  assessing  the  customer  discovery  findings.  The  key  is  to
develop  a  viable  mechanism  that  properly  weights  the  key  issues.  Once  the
scores are impartially applied, discuss the system’s accuracy. If it’s accurate,
score the entire set of customers. Don’t forget to study the outlier comments.

Gain Customer Understanding

In addition to checking your assumptions about customer problems, you need
to  validate  your  hypotheses  about  how  customers  actually  spend  their  days,
spend  their  money  and  get  their  jobs  done.  Whether  the  product  is  for
corporate customers, a social network, or a new consumer electronic device,
you  want  to  understand  in  detail  how  their  lives  or  jobs  work,  how  their
work/design  flow  happens  and  how  they  currently  solve  the  problem  or  fill
the need.

If they’re in a business, are their jobs done in isolation? If not, how do
they interact with other departments? What other products do they use? Is the
problem they’ve identified limited to them, or do others in the company share
it? Is it possible to quantify the impact (dollars, time, costs, etc.) across the
entire organization? The same questions work for consumers. Will they use
the product themselves? Does it depend on others or their friends and family
using it?

You’ll  want  to  check  your  assumptions  about  whether  and  how  much
people  will  pay  for  your  solution.  What  would  make  customers  change  the
way they do things? Price? Features? A new standard? If the customer’s eyes
haven’t glazed over yet, dip your toe into the hypothetical product spec. “If
you  had  a  product  like  this  (describe  yours  in  conceptual  terms),  what
percentage  of  your  time  could  be  spent  using  the  product?  How  mission-
critical is it? Would it solve the pain mentioned earlier? What would be the
barriers to adopting a product like this?” (If you’re a founder who has been in
the industry you’re entering, you may already be a domain expert and already
bring deep customer understanding.)

Since  someday  soon  your  startup  will  have  to  create  demand  to  reach
these  customers,  use  this  opportunity  to  find  out  how  they  learn  about  new

products.  Who  are  the  visionaries  in  the  press/analyst/blogging  community
whom they read? Whom they respect?

Finally, never pass up an opportunity to spot talent. Can these customers
be helpful in the future? For the next round of conversations? For an advisory
board? As a paying customer? To refer you to other customers?

Your goal, after enough of these customer conversations, is to be able to
stand up in front of your company and say, “Here were our hypotheses about
our  customers,  their  problems,  and  how  they  worked.  Now  here’s  what
they’re saying their issues really are, and this is how they really spend their
day.”

Your  goal  is  to  understand  the  customer  in  depth.  What  does  in  depth
mean? It’s impossible to know their jobs as well as they do, but you should
be  so  thoroughly  conversant  with  what  truly  matters  to  customers  that  you
can discuss their issues convincingly.

In business-to-business companies, experience the customer at work, or
at  the  very  least  observe  it.  Spend  a  day  behind  a  cash  register,  at  a  trade
show, or at a conference the target customers are likely to attend. Buy lots of
coffees and have lots of casual conversations. Your goal should be to know
the  customer  you’re  pursuing,  and  every  aspect  of  his  or  her  business,  so
deeply and intimately that they start to think of you and talk to you as if you
were “one of them.”

Know the customer you’re pursuing so deeply they
think you’re “one of them.”

Capture Market Knowledge

With a better customer understanding under your belt, it’s time to round out
your  understanding  of  the  overall  marketplace.  Meet  with  companies  in
adjacent  markets,  industry  analysts,  people  in  the  press,  and  other  key
influencers.  Go  to  industry  trade  shows  and  conferences  to  understand  the
shape and direction of the market you’re about to create.

When you start a company, you should have some vague notion of what
companies  are  in  adjacent  markets  or  are  part  of  the  infrastructure  or
ecosystem of your business. Through your own contacts, but usually through
introductions, take peers out to lunch. In exchange, gather information—not
competitive  information  but  answers  to  questions  such  as:  What  are  the
industry trends? What are key unresolved customer needs? Who are the key
players  in  this  market?  What  should  I  read?  Whom  should  I  know?  What
should I ask? What customers should I call on?

What  will  motivate  these  people  to  meet?  Most  won’t  do  it  out  of  the
goodness of their hearts; rather, they’ll meet to make a “trade.” They’ll learn
about a key problem and its solution in exchange for providing their industry
knowledge and insights.

Just  as  you  did  with  your  problem  presentation  to  potential  customers,
don’t  present  or  sell—just  listen  and  learn.  Spend  the  time  to  take  a  few  of
the  friendliest  customers  to  lunch  and  ask  them  who  they  see  as  potential
competitors,  both  internally  and  externally.  Who  do  they  think  has  similar
products? Who else is an innovator in this space? Has this solution been tried
elsewhere  in  their  company?  Is  anyone  else  inside  their  company  trying  to
build  this  product?  It’s  amazing  how  much  you  can  learn  from  the  people
who will eventually buy your product.

Ask the same questions of peers in adjacent markets, and after practicing

on  them,  try  to  make  contact  with  the  key  industry  influencers  and
recommenders listed in Phase 1 and ask them the same set of questions.

It’s a rare company that doesn’t have a website. These provide a treasure
trove of information, literally available at one’s fingertips, about competitors,
the  market,  and  the  industry  where  the  company  plans  to  compete.  Start  by
Googling the problem and reading perhaps the first few hundred links. Be as
specific  as  possible  in  selection  of  search  terms,  and  try  several  different
searches  for  maximum  information.  This  effort  leads  to  a  wealth  of  market
information,  including  news  about  the  category,  companies  providing
solutions,  key  blogs  and  websites  addressing  the  industry,  industry  experts,
and consultants.

Take competitors to lunch.

Then  dive  deeper  into  each  competitor  uncovered  in  the  initial  search.
Find  out  not  only  what  they  say  about  themselves  but  also  what  others  say
about them—positive and negative. Try to discern key product features and
selling  points,  which  help  differentiate  the  new  offering  from  competition.
Collect  industry  and  competitive  press  releases,  studies,  and  reports,  and
follow the thread to the consultants, researchers or pundits who wrote them to
see what else they’ve said.

Next,  start  gathering  quantitative  market  data.  More  than  likely,  Wall
Street analysts issue reports on the market or adjacent markets. Get copies of
all of these reports. More important, actually read them. Understand what the
analysts believe are the trends, the players, business models, and key metrics.
Finally,  industry  conferences  and  trade  shows  are  invaluable  and
essential.  Never  say,  “I’m  too  busy  to  attend.”  Attend  at  least  two  key
conferences or trade shows (the important ones picked in Phase 1). Not only
do they provide great trinkets, but conferences and trade shows are the prime
areas for both talent-and trend-spotting. Ask usual questions about trends and
players,  but  this  time  accomplish  a  few  things  that  can’t  happen  anywhere
else. Get demos of competitive and adjacent products. Get your hands on the
products themselves, get competitors’ literature, talk to their salespeople, and
generally immerse yourself in your new industry. Attend as many conference
sessions as possible, listening to others describe their products. What are their
visions  of  the  future,  and  how  do  they  compare  with  your  own  newly

 
developed value proposition?

After  testing  the  customer  problem  (or  need)  and  gaining  a  complete
understanding  of  the  customer,  it’s  time  to  expose  the  product  itself  to
potential  customers  for  the  first  time.  Not  to  sell  to  them  but  to  get  their
feedback.  Before  doing  so,  be  sure  to  update  the  hypotheses  and  business
model wherever changes are indicated.

Customer Discovery, Phase Three: “Get
Out of the Building” and Test the Product
Solution

STEVE’S PHONE RANG AND THE VOICE ON THE end said, “You don’t know me
but I just read your book and think I need your help.” That was the day we
got  to  know  one  of  the  most  innovative  startups  within  a  “Fortune  500”
corporation (#6): General Electric’s Energy Storage division.

Prescott  Logan,  the  unit’s  brand-new  general  manager,  recognized  that
his  unit’s  new  sodium  industrial  battery  was  a  disruptive  innovation,  which
GE traditionally does well, but aimed at a market where the end users were
unknowns. Logan realized his division looked more like a multimillion-dollar
startup  with  all  the  usual  startup  uncertainty,  but  located  within  a  huge,
execution-oriented company. He needed a framework or architecture to help
his  team  deal  with  a  “white  space”  market  and  apply  startup  “search”  and
customer  discovery  principles  at  a  company  known  for  “six  sigma”
execution.

Energy  Storage  was  buying  capital  equipment,  breaking  ground  on  a
massive factory, and out making sales calls—in full “execute” mode, the way
most  big  companies  work—based  on  a  ton  of  diligence  and  an  external
consultant’s  30,000-foot  view  of  the  opportunity,  but  not  likely  having  had
enough face-to-face end user conversations.

Soon after the call, the customer-facing team came to the ranch to map a
customer  discovery  plan.  They  had  a  clear  fix  on  the  “customer  problem”
(life cycle, wider range of operating temperatures, etc.), and knew how they’d
take  the  well-vetted  innovation  from  the  lab  to  manufacturing,  but  one
question  remained.  Who  would  buy  it  in  volume,  and  why?  In  two  days  of
brainstorming, the Customer Development process offered GE the following
initial observations:

The  new  GE  battery  should  serve  dozens  of  market  segments,  not  just
the two they’d selected: backup systems for cell towers and data centers

They  needed  to  look  many  more  customers  in  the  eye  to  validate  the
market selection

Product  managers  were  spending  too  much  time  in  Schenectady,  N.Y.
there  were  no  customers  and  no  answers.
headquarters,  where 
Customers were outside the building

With  an  existing  global  customer  base,  GE  had  plenty  of  access  to
potential customers

They  needed  to  find  earlyvangelists,  essential  when  launching  new
technology like GE’s, and determine the earlyvangelists’ characteristics
as well as how to find them

They  needed  a  formal  process  to  review  what  discovery  data  they’d
gathered to date to understand how different the value proposition was
for each market segment—and where the opportunities might be greatest
for  a  high-performance,  more  expensive  alternative  to  lead-acid
industrial batteries (far bigger versions of the one in your car)

What  other  business  model  “boxes”  would  customers  like  them  to
change  in  order  to  sign  a  purchase  order?  The  GE  team  uncovered
several including changing the product features themselves, making the
leasing  and  other
product  somewhat  configurable,  and  offering 
alternative financing models

Prescott  grasped  Customer  Development  faster  and  better  than  anyone
we had ever seen. The Energy Storage division was a startup. All the rules for
managing  and  launching  product  line  extensions—business  plans  and
revenue  models—didn’t  work.  They  needed  instead  to  first  test  their  basic
hypotheses about their business model.

Leaving  the  ranch,  Prescott  and  team  joined  the  million-mile  club  as
they  flew  across  the  U.S.  and  to  Asia,  Africa  and  the  Middle  East,  meeting
face-to-face  with  dozens  of  prospects,  suspects,  and  influentials  to  explore
multiple potential new markets and applications. They did their best to leave
PowerPoint  decks  behind,  and  listen  to  customers’  problems,  needs,  and
frustrations  with  the  battery  status  quo.  Unscripted,  open-ended  discussions
with  a  wide  range  of  prospects  were  conducted  worldwide  to  listen  about

how  prospects  bought  their  batteries,  how  often  they  used  them,  and  the
operating  conditions.  In  one  target  market,  Prescott  actually  relocated  a  top
customer development team member and his family to India and said “don’t
come  home  til  you  get  a  purchase  order  signed,”  which  he  did,  learning
immensely about how his target segment customers might use the battery and
—more important—how they’d evaluate and buy.

Talking to a wide range of prospects, the team soon found more market
segments, and even though they aren’t huge businesses yet, they’re promising
because the product’s unique capabilities “unlock” far more value for users in
certain  segments.  For  example, 
footprint  and
environmental  friendliness  make  it  a  far  better  choice  as  a  backup  to
computer systems in high-rise office buildings, where real estate is expensive
and the floors often can’t hold the weight of massive lead-acid battery arrays.
In  one  case,  they  found  an  architect  who  said  “I  don’t  really  care  what  it
costs, I want it.”– the precise definition of an earlyvangelist!

the  battery’s  small 

It was customer discovery and early validation on steroids, driven by a
passionate entrepreneurial CEO (though Jeff Immelt has that particular title)
who’d  stand  up  against  any  valley  startup  leader.  Prescott’s  boss,  GE  VP
Tina  Donikowski,  provided  cover  while  the  team  executed  the  thorough,
honest  search  process  any  startup  must  have,  rather  than  the  six  sigma
execution  drills  that  made  GE  so  famous.  And  Prescott  chose  people  who
didn’t fit the typical big company mold: “white space” thinkers who lived for
the search and embrace the unknown.

While the jury is still out, and the business is a long way from its huge
revenue goals, this team of passionate entrepreneurs hiding in a “Fortune 6”
company have just about posted a “sold out” sign on the factory for its first
six months of operation. We think that sign has a good chance of being up for
a while.

“Test the Solution:” an Overview

The  previous  phase  tested  the  customer  problem  or  need  and  explored
customers’  passion  for  it,  This  phase  tests  whether  the  solution  to  that
problem—the  value  proposition—gets  customers’  enthusiastic  enough  to
buy/use the product. This phase has five steps:

Update the business model and team—a Pivot or proceed point

Create  the  product  solution  presentation  (physical  channel)  or  the  high
fidelity MVP test (web/mobile)

Test  the  “product  solution”  (physical  channel)  or  begin  to  measure
customer behavior (web/mobile channel)

Yet again, update the business model and team

Identify the first advisory board members

Update the Business Model and Team (a Pivot-or-
Proceed Point)

With  a  far  deeper  understanding  of  customers  and  their  problems,  it’s  time
for  an  important  pivot-or-proceed  pause  in  the  Customer  Development
process. While some startups have already pivoted, every entrepreneur should
use this step to take a pause and review the collection of customer feedback
about the problem and its importance. Those findings, coupled with extensive
customer,  industry,  and  competitive  research,  have  taught  the  company  a
great  deal  about  its  customers,  how  they  work  or  play,  the  market,  and  the
problem  the  company  has  been  founded  to  solve.  This  learning  makes  it  a
near-certainty that at least some business model hypotheses need to change.
(When  a  substantial  change  is  made  to  one  or  more  business  model
hypotheses, it’s a pivot.)

Start  this  phase  by  gathering  as  much  of  the  company  management  as
possible (not just the founders and VPs but directors and managers as well),
along  with  key  investors,  for  the  pivot-or-proceed  review.  Share  everything
that’s  been  learned,  with  a  focus  on  customer  feedback  regarding  the
importance or severity of the problem or need—the potential product/market
fit.  The  group  also  reviews  new  findings  that  may  affect  hypotheses  or

assumptions  made  in  Phase  1,  adjusting  them  where  appropriate.  These  can
often  include  the  value  proposition  or  product  specs,  customer  segments,
pricing, and revenue model assumptions.

Start by Assembling the Data

Before the meeting, the Customer Development team gathers all the customer
data and builds a work-flow map of the prototypical customer. At the meeting
itself, the spokesperson for the team diagrams and describes how customers
actually  do  their  job  and  whom  they  interact  with.  This  provides  a  reality
check of the customer hypotheses. Keep diagramming and drawing until it’s
easy  to  explain  how  customers’  businesses  and  lives  work  today,  including
how  they  spend  their  time  and  money.  Compare  this  description  with  the
initial  hypotheses.  (While  corporate  customers  may  have  more  formal
organization  to  diagram,  a  consumer  will  have  more  external  influencers  to
track.)

With the customer work flow and interactions fully described, dive into
the real news. What problems did customers say they have? How painful are
these  problems?  Where  on  the  “problem  scale”  are  the  customers  you
interviewed? How are they solving these problems today? Draw the customer
workflow  with  and  without  your  product.  Is  the  difference  dramatic?  Did
customers say they would pay for that difference? In general, what did you
learn  about  customers’  problems?  What  were  the  biggest  surprises?  What
were the biggest disappointments?

Question Everything

Once  the  Customer  Development  team  has  presented  its  findings,  the  fun
begins.  You  can  now  ask  the  most  difficult  question.  Given  all  that’s  been
learned from talking to customers, how well do the preliminary product specs
solve  their  problems?  Dead  on?  Somewhat?  Not  exactly?  If  the  answer  is
“somewhat”  or  “not  exactly,”  this  meeting  becomes  a  soul-searching,
company-building  exercise.  Is 
the  right  people  weren’t
interviewed?  Failed  to  talk  to  enough  people?  Because  nobody  asked  the
right  questions?  This  assessment  is  critical  because  of  a  fundamental
assumption  of  the  Customer  Development  model:  before  changing  the

it  because 

product, keep looking for customer enthusiasm. If and only if no customers
can be found for the product, discuss changing the feature list.

People  who  talk  to  customers  tend  to  collect  a  list  of  features  that,  if
added,  will  get  one  additional  customer  to  buy.  Soon  there’s  a  10-page
feature  list  just  for  selling  10  customers.  In  contrast,  in  Customer
Development  the  goal  is  to  have  a  single-paragraph  feature  list  that  can  be
sold to thousands of customers.

What if everyone believes you’re talking to the right customers but the
feedback says you’re building the wrong product? Something has to change.
Don’t  continue  building  the  product  and  think  miracles  will  happen.  Either
get back outside the building and find a different set of customers who will
buy the product or consider changing the features.

Assuming  the  product  is  at  least  a  partial  fit  for  customers’  problems,
continue  examining  the  product  assumptions  and  specs.  Based  on  customer
feedback,  review  the  Phase  1  feature  list.  Prioritize  the  features  in  terms  of
their  importance  to  the  customer.  Can  the  Customer  Development  team
match each feature to a customer problem? If not, why not? While figuring
out what features to ship is important, knowing which features don’t matter is
equally  important.  Which  features  did  customers  not  care  about?  Can  any
features on the product spec be deleted or deferred? Remember, in a startup
the  Customer  Development  team  isn’t  supposed  to  be  adding  features;  it’s
supposed  to  be  finding  out  the  minimum  feature  set,  based  on  input  from
visionary customers.

Next, review and get agreement on the delivery schedule, again revising
Phase  1  assumptions  as  necessary.  As  noted  earlier,  visionary  customers,
particularly in corporations, will be buying into the entire vision, not just the
MVP. They will need to hear what the company plans to deliver over the next
18 months.

Earlyvangelists need to hear about the 18-month
product roadmap.

Finally, as a group, review the other Phase 1 hypotheses. (Now it’s clear
why  writing  them  all  down  was  important.)  Given  all  the  feedback  from
customers,  which  of  the  four  market  types  is  the  company  in?  Why  is  it

 
different?  What  are  its  competitive  advantages?  Do  the  initial  pricing  and
delivery channel assumptions hold up? What was learned about influencers?

Pivot or Proceed

Regardless  of  channel,  this  step  concludes  with  the  first  of  many  pivot-or-
proceed  discussions.  Management  and  investors  affirm  they’re  confident
they’re  the  company  has  uncovered  a  problem  in  which  a  sizable  enough
universe of customers is clearly eager to solve. If not, it’s time to rethink the
value  proposition  and  attack  a  more  severe  problem  or  a  need  of  greater
interest or urgency to a larger customer universe. If the universe is eager to
solve  the  problem,  the  group  moves  on  to  present  its  potential  product
solution to customers.

...summarizing customer findings is not an
accounting problem.

One last thought: Collecting and summarizing customer findings is not
an  accounting  problem.  You  aren’t  simply  adding  up  the  number  of
responses. You’re looking for learning, meaning and insight in the data. And
more than anything, you’re looking for hordes of customers who will try to
rip the product right out of your hands so they can have it before their friends
or competitors.

Create the Product “Solution” Presentation

Once  product  development  and  Customer  Development  teams  agree  on  the
revised  hypotheses,  the  next  step  is  to  assemble  the  first  product  “solution”
presentation. This presentation is emphatically not the presentation used for
fundraising  or  recruiting.  Nor  is  it  the  problem  presentation  just  used  with
customers in Phase 2. Toss those slides out and start over. This presentation
tests  the  revised  assumptions  about  the  product  itself.  It’s  a  solution
presentation  confirming  that  the  product  fits  a  serious  customer  problem  or
need.  Customers  confirm  their  interest  by  expressing  interest  in  buying  or
using the product.

The presentation should cover the five (no more!) key product features
and the problems they solve. Include a story about “life before the product”
and  “life  after  the  product”  where  appropriate.  Draw  the  customer’s  work
flow  or  the  consumer’s  day  “before”  and  “after”  the  product.  Leave  out  all
the marketing, positioning and fluff. Close with the product vision (from the
value proposition “vision” hypothesis) at least 18 months out.

Leave plenty of room and “cues” in the presentation to prompt customer
feedback. Rehearse. Remember that this is still not “selling,” but an effort to
uncover  whether  the  product  is  salable.  Learn  enough  so  that  when  selling
begins, the team is confident that customers will be eager to buy.

Here’s the product/solution presentation outline:

     Review the problem. Start by reminding the audience about problems the

product is designed to solve and why a solution is important if not urgent.
Pause here to re-validate the importance of solving the problem. As
surprises emerge, return to Phase 2.

     Describe the solution. Demonstrate the product if possible; even sketches
or prototypes of key concepts or features help customers understand.
Pause to probe for a reaction. Do customers agree it solves the problem?

     Draw the customer work flow before and after the new product. Validate
the “before and after” work flow. Describe who else in the customer’s
organization the solution might affect.

     Understand the value equation: Some customers will pay almost anything
for a product that solves a serious business problem. Sometimes, third-
party features enhance value when added. Keep pricing discussions fluid,
and identify the key values a prospect sees. Watch for pleasant upside
pricing opportunities.

The  product/  “solution”  presentation  should  take  no  more  than  20
minutes.  In  the  next  step,  you’ll  present  it  to  customers  and  listen  to  their
feedback.

If an MVP doesn’t exist, a demo or prototype will make the discussion
more  effective.  This  is  why  fashion  designers  make  one  actual  dress  and
show it to buyers, car companies build one “concept car” to display, and why
toy  companies  make  one  or  two  nonworking  Styrofoam  prototypes  of  the
latest  toys  and  games  to  show  buyers.  The  more  an  MVP  looks,  feels,  and
works like the product, the more informed the customers’ reactions will be.
Obviously,  this  is  far  easier  in  some  product  categories  than  others.  (Try
prototyping  the  new  787  jetliner,  for  example.)  Equally  obvious:  the  closer
the MVP is to a touchable, usable prototype, the fewer slides are needed for
the solution presentation.

Test the Product Solution with the Customer

With  the  solution  presentation  complete,  decide  which  customers  to  visit.
Earlier,  your  “problem  discovery”  visits  should  have  reached  at  least  50
potential  customers.  Try  to  deliver  this  solution  presentation  to  every
qualified  prospect  who  heard  the  problem  presentation.  Expand  the  original
set  of  customer  contacts  to  include  at  least  10  potential  customers  for
complex  products  like  enterprise  software,  and  many  more  for  consumer
products.  These  new  contacts  keep  the  momentum  going  and  lay  the
groundwork for selling something during customer validation.

This time, test previous assumptions about the titles of people who will
make the purchasing decision. Return to the customer types described earlier,
and  interview  several  of  each  type  to  get  a  full  spectrum  of  feedback.  Find
prospective saboteurs wherever possible, with an eye to spotting patterns in
their  job  titles.  With  the  call  list  in  hand,  create  an  introductory  e-mail,
reference story and sales script, and then get out of the building.

Solution Presentation

Begin  by  reminding  the  audience  what  problem  the  product  is  designed  to
solve and why the company believes solving the problem is important. With
agreement  on  the  problem  and  its  significance,  it’s  finally  time  for  the
solution presentation you developed earlier (most entrepreneurs have wanted
to do this since Day One, so you should be ready by now). Demonstrate the
product, rough prototype or MVP wherever possible for maximum impact.

Now  it’s  time  to  listen.  After  hearing  the  solution  description,  how  do
customers think it solves their problem. Do they think it’s different? Do they

think  the  product  is  creating  a  new  market,  or  is  it  a  better  version  of  an
existing product (and, if so, better in what way)? Or do they yawn or shrug?
Check  other  hypotheses.  What  do  customers  think  about  the  proposed
revenue  model  and  pricing?  What  are  comparable  prices  for  this  kind  of
product?

Use  a  post-visit  “report  card” 

to  consistently  record  feedback.
Remember, this isn’t a sales call, but an exploration to see whether customers
believe  the  product  is  a  strong  solution  to  an  important  problem—and  to
gauge  whether  the  solution  is  strong  enough  to  get  them  to  buy  when  the
product’s ready.

“Show Me the Money” Questions

When  talking  to  visionary  customers  about  big-ticket  b-to-b  products,  ask
several  questions  to  test  adoption.  “Would  you  deploy  our  software
enterprise-wide if it were free?” Tests the seriousness of a potential customer.
If  the  customer  isn’t  ready  to  deploy  the  software  even  for  free,  you’re
obviously  talking  to  the  wrong  person.  When  a  customer  is  willing  to
visualize the pain of rolling out your product, ask how they would deploy it,
how  many  users  would  use  it,  what  groups  would  get  it  first,  the  criteria
they’d use to measure its success, and so on. By the end of this visualization
exercise,  potential  customers  are  sometimes  mentally 
installing  and
deploying your software.

Be  sure  to  get  to  the  “who  has  the  money”  question.  There’s  nothing
more frustrating than having a series of great customer meetings for months
only to find out very late in the sales cycle that no department has the budget
or  that  new  capital  purchases  are  made  on  an  annual  cycle  that  just  closed.
Ask if a current budget exists for products like this and which department or
individual  would  have  the  budget.  The  information  will  be  critical  when
assembling the sales roadmap.

Pricing Questions

Explore  the  pricing  boundaries.  Ask,  “Would  you  pay  $1  million  for  our
software?”  The  answer  is  usually  instructive.  Suppose  customers  said,  “we
couldn’t see paying more than $250,000 for the first set of applications.” In

their minds, they had already bought the product and the bill just came due.
The  first  number  out  of  their  mouths  was  usually  what  they  had  in  their
immediate budget or the initial purchase price.

Sample Customer Discovery Report Card (Figure 5.1)

Once you get a first number, ask, “How much more would you expect to
pay  for  professional  services  (the  customization  and  installation)?”  Most  of
the  time  they’ll  say  that  that  cost  was  included  in  their  budget  number,  but
some add to that figure. Then push and see whether they would spend those
extra  dollars  every  year  or  ask,  “What  would  we  have  to  do  to  get  you  to
spend twice that? Three times that?”

After a few of these customer exercises, you’ll understand your average

selling price and sense the lifetime value of a customer.

Channel Questions

What  about  distribution?  Test  these  assumptions  by  asking  customers  how
they would most likely buy. Retail store? Online? Direct sales? Distributor?
From there, as time allows, explore how marketing might reach the customer
with questions like:

If  you  were  interested  in  a  product  like  this,  how  would  you  find  out
about it?

How do you find out about other new products like this?

Do you ask others for their opinions before buying? If so, whom?

Do you or your staff go to trade shows?

What  industry-specific  magazines  or  journals  do  you  read?  What
business publications?

For  consumer  products,  ask  what  general-interest  publications,
newspapers, bloggers or websites would best connect with the consumer

“Get/Keep/Grow Questions”

Next,  probe  the  customers’  product  acquisition  process.  For  corporate
products,  ask,  “How  does  your  company  buy  products  like  this?  Walk  me
through the approval cycle. Who is involved?” Software entrepreneurs should
be  forewarned  that  many  Fortune  500  companies,  too  often  burned,

automatically  reject  software  offerings  from  startups  that  haven’t  reached
their fifth birthday. If it’s a consumer product, understand the buying process.
Is this an impulse buy? Do they buy only known brands? Items advertised on
TV?

Presentation Tips

A few tips to smooth the way:

Don’t  attempt  to  ask  every  question  in  each  solution  interview.  Some
customers will know more about one aspect of the product than another

Opt  for  one-on-one  discussions  over  large-group  meetings.  You’ll  get
more detail and more thoughtful opinions

Convert  the  discussions  into  a  rough  sales  pipeline  based  on  people’s
interest in buying

It’s better to find and stop work on or delete unnecessary features than
features to add new ones. The goal is an MVP now!

It’s  optimistic  to  expect  customers  to  share  all  this  information  at  the
first  presentation  or  to  expect  every  customer  to  know  enough  to  answer
every  question.  Try  to  accumulate  answers  to  all  the  questions  over  the
course of all the customer visits. Completing this phase signifies a complete
understanding  of  customers’  problems  and  a  solid  grip  on  their  level  of
product interest.

Meet the Channel

If any form of indirect sales channel will be involved, one more group needs
to see the solution presentation your potential channel partners needs to see.
While  it’s  too  early  to  sign  up  channel  partners  with  formal  commitments,
meet  them  now  and  understand  what  it  would  take  to  get  them  to  sell  the
product.

What do channel partners need to hear or see from early customers?

How do customers access their channel?

Is it the kind of product they’d sell proactively?

Do  they  want  articles  in  the  business  press,  product  reviews  and
customers calling them and asking for the product?

Do  they  seek  financial  inducements  such  as  shelf-stocking  fees,
guaranteed  returns  or—worse—a  “guaranteed  sale”  policy  that  allows
them to return unsold merchandise?

Channel  partners  won’t  magically  know  how  to  position  or  price  the
new product. For products in an existing market, it’s easy to tell them, “It’s
like  that  other  one  you  sell  but  faster.”  For  re-segmented  and  new  markets,
indirect channels have a harder time understanding how to position products.
Spend time understanding channel partners’ motivations and incentives, and
soliciting their feedback about features, pricing, sales opportunities and more.
Understand  each  channel  partner’s  business  model.  Why?  There’s  no
way  to  understand  how  much  channel  partners  should  order  or  how  much
they should charge customers unless their business model is clear. See how
other companies do it. Take other executives to lunch and ask about margins
and  discounts.  The  worst  that  could  happen  is  that  they  won’t  disclose  the
information.  Keeping  all  this  in  mind,  assemble  a  channel/service  partner
presentation  and  stress  what’s  in  it  for  the  partner.  Partners  are  usually
fondest  of  things  on  which  they  make  more  than  just  margin—some  like
products that require installation, service or ongoing supplies, such as paper
and  toner  for  copiers.  Finally,  hit  the  streets  to  start  a  dialogue  and  learn
about their business:

How do companies establish a relationship with them?

Do they hear their customers asking for a product like yours?

How  does  a  potential  partner  make  money?  (By  project?  By  hour?  By
reselling software?)

How does their business model compare with others in their business?

What is the minimum dollar size for a transaction of interest to them?

Understand each channel partner’s business model well enough to draw
it on a whiteboard

Update the Business Model Again
(Another Pivot-or-Proceed Point)

Here you’ll update the business model to reflect the latest round of customer
discovery “solution” findings and how they do or don’t affect the elements of
your  business  model.  Think  of  it  as  a  “tune  up,”  since  you’ll  conduct  a
thorough business model review in the next phase.

Your focus here is totally about customers’ enthusiasm for the product,

and the conversation should be about pass/fail test results, not opinions.

Your business model should undergo regular
updates.

Look for Massive Customer Enthusiasm

This is the time to remember that lukewarm response to any product or the
problem  it  solves  is  a  serious,  red-alert  danger  signal  that  calls  for  an
iteration  or  a  pivot  rather  than  an  automatic  step  forward  into  customer
validation.  Discuss  the  percentages  as  well  as  the  number  of  customers
visited who express rabid or significant enthusiasm for the product and high
confidence that it solves an important business problem or fills a high-priority
consumer need. What’s the team’s honest appraisal of how many customers
would run out and buy it immediately? How many would tell all their friends
or  associates?  Did  any  or,  better,  many  declare  the  best  possible  vote  of
confidence, “I don’t care if it’s not complete or perfect—I want it now”? Start

 
the  conversation  by  sorting  customer  reactions  into  the  following  main
categories:

     Category 1: Customers unequivocally love the product, and no changes

are needed.

     Category 2: Customers like the product, but we’ve heard consistently that

they want this or that additional feature at launch.

     Category 3: Customers can understand the product after a long

explanation, but no one was jumping over the table to buy it.

     Category 4: Customers don’t see much of a need for the product.

If  most  of  the  customers  fall  into  Category  1,  congratulations!  If  the
business  model  components  “add  up,”  as  reviewed  in  the  next  step,  it  may
well be time move on to customer validation.

Regardless  of  channel,  customer  discovery  sought  a  market  for  the
product as originally spec’ed. The most dangerous customer responses lie in
Category 2: “We need more features.” As emphasized earlier, knowing which
features don’t matter is as important as knowing which features to ship first.
Balance customer reactions with development time, since it may take much
more  product  development  effort  to  earn  a  convincing  Category  1  answer.
Why?  Because  the  joke  is  true:  “Normal  people  believe  if  it  isn’t  broke,  it
doesn’t  need  to  be  fixed.  Engineers  believe  if  it  isn’t  broke,  it  doesn’t  have
enough features yet.”

The  natural  instinct  of  Engineering  is  to  keep  adding  features.  But
customer discovery is a race to get the MVP into paying customers’ hands as
quickly as possible, so fewer features or an MVP that’s just “good enough”
are  far  better  than  losing  a  month  or  even  a  week’s  worth  of  customer
feedback. Ask whether any features can be deferred. Let early customers help
determine  which  features  and  functionality  to  add  and  in  what  sequence.
Listening carefully to the right customers delivers a product strategy with a
high likelihood of success in any channel.

Answers in Categories 3 and 4—customers aren’t jumping over the table
or don’t see a need—are typical during a first round of customer discovery.
At  a  minimum,  they  require  serious  thought  and  probably  a  pivot  that
involves restarting Phase 1 from the beginning rather than continuing forward
on a death march to failure. This makes for a challenging board meeting but

is  often  a  critical  turning  point  for  investors  and  company  alike.  For
technology  products,  lukewarm  customer  response  can  indicate  a  profound
problem, usually characterized as the lack of product/market fit: not enough
of a market for the product or a lack of robust demand for a product in a vast
market.

Repackaging the Product—A Pivot Strategy

Other  issues  are  sometimes  referred  to  as  positioning  but  more  accurately
described as “product repackaging.” Product repackaging is a problem most
technology  startups  have  to  deal  with  at  some  point.  A  technology-driven
startup’s  first  product  is  usually  determined  by  the  founding  product
development team. Often the product development team has a perfect feel for
what  the  customers’  needs  are  and  how  the  customers  want  to  buy  the
product.  But  most  of  the  time  they  don’t.  If  they  haven’t  been  intimately
connected  to  the  customer,  the  initial  product  configuration  needs  further
refinement  by  the  Customer  Development  team.  While  the  core  technology
might be spot-on, its match for customer needs or purchase preferences can
be off. A single monolithic software package might be too expensive or too
complex to sell that way. Technology repackaging might solve the problem
by reconfiguring the product features. Perhaps it can be sold as modules, or
as  a  subscription  service,  or  with  increasingly  featured  versions,  without
requiring  Product  Development  to  completely  reengineer  the  product.  This
problem must be caught and dealt with in customer discovery or it may affect
the company’s ability to survive.

Update the Business Model Canvas Again

Regardless  of  channel,  this  series  of  analyses  and  discussions  will  almost
certainly  affect  some  of  the  business  model  hypotheses.  Most  likely  to  be
affected  is  the  value  proposition,  since  this  first  “solution  discovery”  effort
helps shed light on whether people think the product solves the problem in a
way that compels them to buy. When it doesn’t, the value proposition is the
most likely suspect for adjustment, whether features are added or subtracted
as a result.

Customer  segments  should  be  reviewed,  since  the  product  may  have

resonated  well  with  some  segments  and  not  others.  If,  for  example,  the
product  generates  excitement  only  among  a  subset  of  the  intended  market
(men, not women; managers, not staff people), that discovery will affect the
revenue stream hypothesis as well. The team will conduct a thorough review
of the business model in the next phase, so this is best thought of as a tune-up
that  updates  the  model  to  reflect  the  latest  round  of  customer  discovery
“solution” findings.

As  good  as  any  founding  team  may  be,  invaluable  people  outside  the
company  who  can’t  be  hired  full  time  will  often  be  willing  to  help  in  an
advisory  capacity.  These  advisers  can  help  solve  technical  problems,
introduce  key  customers,  provide  domain-specific  knowledge,  and  share
business  expertise  and  wisdom.  Throughout  customer  discovery,  when
meeting  customers  and  analysts,  prospecting  for  advisory  board  members
should always be in the back of everyone’s minds.

Product Development should engage some advisers for specific help in
designing  and  building  the  product,  and  a  business  mentor,  someone  who’s
been  through  the  startup  grind  before,  may  also  be  helpful.  One  or  two
customer voices typically stand out from the crowd. Engage these people by
asking them for advice, taking them to lunch or dinner, and seeing if they’re
interested  in  helping.  Formalize  the  advisory  board  process  later,  during
customer validation.

Customer Discovery, Phase Four: Verify
the Business Model and Pivot or Proceed

HAS YOUR CUSTOMER DISCOVERY EFFORT turned your hypotheses (or guesses)
into hard facts? Do you believe it’s time to proceed to customer validation,
when you test whether your business model can scale?

There are three critical questions to answer:

1.  Have we found a product/market fit? Is there sizable demand for solving
the  problem,  and  does  the  product  fill  that  demand  well  in  the
customers’ eyes?

2.  Who are our customers and how do we reach them? Do we understand
the demography and archetypes of our key target customers and enough
about their behavior to know how to find them cost-effectively?

3.  Can we make money and grow the company? Can we grow predictably

and large enough to make a great company?

If your answer to this analysis is “proceed,” remember that it’s still not
time  to  launch.  This  go/no-go  decision  answers  only  one  question:  do  we
have enough confidence in customers’ enthusiasm and the product/market fit
to proceed to customer validation and see if our business model scales by five
times, 10 times or more? It’s often frustrating to entrepreneurs who make the
“go” decision, since they’re rarin’ to get out and start doing and selling. After
all,  that’s  what  entrepreneurs  do.  It’s  also  a  dangerous  trap:  customer
validation accelerates spending, which—if unsuccessful—can cost you your
job, your equity, or both. (As we’ve said, this process isn’t easy.)

Is This Business Worth Doing? (Figure 6.1)

Bring  your  team  and  investors  to  a  “full  stop”  to  answer  the  questions
above. At a bare minimum, whether you Pivot or Proceed is the subject of an
entire board meeting. Generally this assessment forces at least one return trip
back to the start of the discovery process. This is the norm! (It’s far better to
find out now, before more years of 100-hour workweeks are invested.)

Have We Found a Product/Market Fit?

Product/market fit has three components:

Is  the  problem  or  need  that’s  addressed  urgent  or  vital  to  lots  of
customers—i.e., is there a market? (Replace “lots” with a real “pass/fail”
number.)

Does your product solve the problem or fill the need at a price customers

will gladly pay? (Insert real number from business model, of course.)

Are  there  enough  customers  (insert  number)  “out  there”  to  deliver  a
sizable (insert number) business opportunity?

This  checkpoint  is  important  enough  to  take  these  questions  one  at  a
time. (If you’re uncertain or want more data, there’s a deeper exploration of
this set of questions at the end of Chapter 11.)

Are you attacking a serious problem or filling a
compelling need?

This  question  should  have  been  thoroughly  probed  directly  with  customers
both  online  and,  more  important,  face-to-face.  Have  you  consistently  heard
enthusiastic responses like “This is a high-priority problem (or need) near the
top  of  my  list?”  If  they  add  comments  like  “I’d  pay  anything  to  solve  this
problem” or “My patchwork solution isn’t good enough,” even better. Probe
only  for  a  high  level  of  consistent  enthusiasm.  That  defines  a  market
opportunity.

Key questions to review and discuss:

Did your customers have friends or colleagues with similar problems or
needs, and did they think the problem was important enough to discuss it
with, or refer it to, their friends or coworkers?

Were  many  of  the  customers  you  met  attempting  home-grown  or
workaround solutions to the problem your product will solve?

Did most customers rate the problem or need’s severity at 8, 9, or 10 on
a scale of 10?

Did most customers rate the pain caused by the problem at or near 5 on a
scale of 5?

Review the before-and-after customer work-flow diagram.

Was the difference dramatic after buying the product?

Were customers palpably excited?

Did customers say they would pay for that difference?

Does your product solve the problem or fill the need
for your customers?

Review  all  the  customer  feedback  report  cards,  summaries,  and  analysis—
there should be quite a pile of it. Here again, as with validating the problem
question, be sure there’s robust enthusiasm for the product, even in its MVP
form. Look for comments like “I have to have this now” or “Everyone I know
will  want  one”  or  “When  can  I  get  it?”  Lukewarm  or  average  enthusiasm
seldom  delivers  scalable  startups.  Be  objective  and  park  entrepreneurial
enthusiasm at the door.

Key questions to review and discuss:

Did the minimum viable product generate significant “buy” or “engage”
enthusiasm?

Was  the  product  exciting  enough  to  stimulate  significant  customer
referrals? Did those referred customers buy or engage at an encouraging
rate?

Did  the  long-term  product  vision  generate  highly  positive  customer
feedback?

Is  the  latest  product-features-and-benefits  hypothesis  still  appropriate
and profitable?

the 

Did 
enthusiasm?

long-term  product-delivery  schedule  generate  purchase

Also  review  the  delivery  schedule,  revising  assumptions  as  necessary.
Customers  are  buying  into  the  entire  vision,  not  just  the  MVP,  and  need  to
hear how and when the product will evolve.

Are there Enough Customers to Deliver a Sizable
Business Opportunity?

Did  customers  verify  that  they’d  buy  at  the  level  you  expected?  Did  any
competitive or other data emerge pointing to larger or smaller market share?
Review  your  initial  TAM  (total  addressable  market)  and  SAM  (serviceable
market)  hypotheses  and  compare  those  estimates  with  what  customers
actually  said.  How  much  do  they  buy,  how  often,  and  are  their  friends  or
colleagues similarly inclined? Check findings against market knowledge and
competitive analysis data gathered in Phase 2.

Key questions to review and discuss:

Have you validated the TAM and SAM for your market?

Is  the  market  size  as  you  expected,  and  is  it  verified  by  customer
feedback and industry data?

Is the market growing significantly, with strong growth prospects?

Do  customer  conversations  verify  that  they’ll  buy  repeatedly  and  refer
others to do the same?

Did any unexpected competitive threats emerge?

The hard question to answer here is how many customers are “enough.”
This  question  must  be  answered  by  founders  and  investors  together,  with
everyone  on  the  proverbial  “same  page”  about  longer-term  goals  for  the
company  and  whether  results  to  date  point  toward  achieving  those  results.
type.  A  few
These  results  differ  widely  by  channel  and  product 
generalizations:

Enterprise software: Three or four earlyvangelists showing very strong
interest  might  well  be  enough,  provided  that  the  team  has  at  least  as
many  more  enthusiastic  prospects  in  the  pipeline.  Where  possible,
customers should come from multiple segments, and few or no segments
should be far behind the others in terms of interest in the product

Capital equipment: The “three or four” enterprise software rule applies
here,  too,  as  a  rule,  but  a  closer  look  at  results  of  customer  discovery
with  a  broader  range  of  customers  is  helpful.  Are  most  prospects
interested in the product largely as spec’ed, or does everyone want some
form of customization? Do discovery results point to a robust pipeline,

acknowledging that the sales cycle for capital goods can be quite lengthy

Consumer products: Whether it’s a new skateboard or a flat-screen TV,
more  than  a  handful  of  earlyvangelist  customers  is  almost  certainly
required—perhaps  20  or  30  or  more.  It’s  also  important  to  establish
serious interest in the channel where you expect to sell the product. If 15
people  want  to  buy  your  skateboard,  that’s  probably  not  convincing
enough for the Walmart buyer, for example

Web/mobile applications: Since customer discovery efforts should reach
at  least  several  thousand  prospective  users  or  customers,  a  web/mobile
app  should  almost  certainly  activate  at  least  100  apps  or  downloads  to
say  it’s  seen  “enough”  customer  response.  You  should  also  watch  the
percentages, to be sure the conversion rate is encouraging

Social  networks  and  “network  effect”  startups:  These  should  probably
attract  at  least  500  if  not  1,000  active,  engaged  users  to  be  able  say
they’ve attracted “enough.” If the site or app is free or a freemium (free-
to-paid),  that  number  should  be  at  least  three  times—preferably  five
times—larger,  since  it’s  so  much  easier  for  a  user  to  say  “yes”  to
something that’s free. Monitor the activation rate, and look as well at the
percentage  of  users  who  are  returning  regularly—say,  three  times  a
week—since they’re not only an indication of customer volume but also
point to the customers’ quality and engagement

If  the  team  is  talking  to  the  right  customers  but  feedback  says  the
product is wrong, something has to change. Reassess your customer segments
and get back outside to find a different set of customers, or consider changing
the  features,  product  configuration,  pricing,  or  other  business  model
elements.

Do We Know Who Our Customers Are and How to
Reach Them?

The previous step assures that there are customers “out there” who want your
product.  But  do  you  know  how  to  find  them  and  sell  to  them  with  an
affordable marketing or “get customers” budget? This verification step starts
by ensuring that you know “what a customer looks like.”

Can  you  draw  a  customer  archetype  for  each  of  your  key  customer
segments? Does it clearly point you to places where you can find them?

Can you draw a day in the life of a customer so you know how to pitch
the product to him?

Did  some  segments  respond  better,  faster,  or  with  larger  orders  than
others?

Did any new segments emerge, or should any be eliminated?

Do  customers  recognize  big  improvements  in  a  “day  in  the  life”  of
users?

Do you know what your customers read, trade shows they attend, gurus
they follow, and where they turn for new product information?

Can you draw your channel map, showing how the product moves from
your  startup  to  its  end  user,  along  with  the  costs  and  marketing/sales
roles of each step in the sales channel?

Try to measure your “get customers” cost and response rates objectively.
Review the real, “all in” costs (including staff time, overhead, whatever) of
activating or selling, say, 50 customers. When you add up all the costs (not

just the ad or AdWords costs themselves, for example), are you still confident
of  your  ability  to  get  lots  more  customers  at  roughly  the  same  cost  per
customer?

Look beyond your total “Get” budget to identify which programs were
most cost-effective, and do some homework to be sure that if, for example,
you  quintupled  your  e-mail  marketing  budget,  results  would  quintuple  as
well. This is the time to figure out how much you really need to spend to get
one  (or  50)  good  customer(s),  since  you’re  about  to  head  to  customer
validation, where spending will increase by a factor of 10 if not more!

If  a  significant  amount  of  customer  feedback  has  given  you  high
confidence in all these answers, there’s one more step—determining whether
you  can  consistently  acquire  customers  at  the  costs  outlined  in  your  “Get”
hypotheses.  Your  early  tests  of  the  Get  programs  should  have  given  you  a
good sense of that, so review the data collected. Don’t worry if the costs are a
little  high,  since  you’ll  be  optimizing  those  programs  as  you  ramp  them  up
during validation.

Be sure to update the business model based on any changes in customer
acquisition  costs  discovered  in  this  review,  since  they’re  often  the  largest
costs your startup will confront.

Can We Make Money and Grow the Company?

Assemble Revenue Model Data

By this point, the team has assembled a massive amount of hard data about
pricing,  revenue,  costs  and  acquisition  and  marketing  costs,  among  others.
The data needs to be verified, with any gaps filled in along the way, which
may  entail  returning  to  learn  more  in  further  customer,  channel,  or  product
development discussions. The most important hard data to review includes:

summary  of  customer  report  cards,  indicating  potential  sales  revenue
expectations over time

market size estimates

channel cost and revenue potential summaries

pricing plan

customer acquisition costs

detailed  information  about  the  industry,  the  customers,  and  their
behavior

competitive product and pricing information

Combine this data to create an accurate net revenue forecast for at least
the  next  four  quarters  of  the  company’s  existence—the  customer  validation
phase—and,  if  possible,  another  year  beyond  that.  This  shouldn’t  be  a
precise,  to-the-penny  estimate  by  any  means.  Instead,  it’s  more  of  a  rough
“gut  check”  to  be  sure  that  the  company  will  emerge  from  customer
validation as a growing, profitable business. Take a close look at Figure 6.2, a

hypothetical  analysis  of  a  company  selling  both  via  its  own  website  and
through a physical channel. Average cost of customer acquisition is 40% of
revenue in this example. The data assembly is a four-part process:

1.  Compute  the  “best  estimate”  of  total  gross  revenue  the  company  will
receive  directly  from  customers,  quarter  by  quarter.  Review  results  of
customer  discovery  report  cards  and  “get  customers”  program  tests  as
well as market size estimates to estimate the company’s direct revenue
from customers quarter by quarter.

2.  Next, compute the amount of channel revenue (other than direct revenue
for  sales  to  end  users,  from  which  the  company  receives  100  percent).
Review the channel costs (margin, rep fees, promotional costs, etc.) and
deduct them from channel revenues.

3.  Add  the  net  channel  revenue  to  the  total  direct  revenue  by  quarter  to
figure total company revenue. Deduct quarterly operating costs from the
revenue.

4.  Compute all the costs of acquiring customers, recognizing that they will
most  certainly  change  quarter  by  quarter,  both  as  the  company  spends
more money on its “get customers” effort and as it acquires customers
more cost-effectively.

Sample Financial Analysis (Figure 6.2)

The  computation  should  deliver  a  reasonable  rough  estimate  of  the
company’s  revenue  expectations  across  its  next  four  (or,  preferably,  eight)
quarters. Consider developing this entire exercise three different ways, using

a  “good/better/  best”  approach  that  delivers  three  different  forecasts  or
business cases: high, best guess, and worst case.

This  analysis  all  by  itself  may  stop  the  pivot-or-proceed  process  in  its
tracks, as it often does, if the computation shows the company running out of
money within the year. The spreadsheet is a simple example of a rough “cash
burn”  computation  that  should  be  enough  to  send  any  smart  founder  back
through the discovery and validation processes, considering that the company
runs out of money 90 days from moving forward.

Looking  at  an  analysis  like  this,  the  founders  and  investors  should  be
highly  nervous  about  proceeding  to  spend  nearly  $2  million  on  customer
creation activities. The startup in this example has several options:

Raise another few hundred thousand dollars immediately in order just to
survive the year ahead

Reduce the spending on operations or customer acquisition costs

Cut staff or reduce founder salaries until break-even is achieved

Without taking any of these steps, the company will clearly not survive,

and it must return to refine its business model.

Key questions to review and discuss:

Have you translated market and market share findings into potential unit
sales and revenue?

Have you validated your pricing model with customers?

Are volume, demand, and purchase-frequency hypotheses validated?

Were  any  unanticipated  channel  costs  uncovered,  such  as  sales  reps’
salaries or promotional fees?

If  the  market  is  multi-sided,  have  all  costs  of  generating  “buy”-side
revenue been estimated?

Does  this  rough  forecast  point  to  a  scalable,  profitable  business  with
substantial exit value?

This  is  either  the  beginning  of  the  end  or,  more  likely,  just  the  end  of  the
beginning.  It’s  where  you  must  acknowledge  that  an  estimated  one  idea  in
thousands morphs into a scalable, profitable big company with an exit value
of $100 million or more. The company has put a stake in the ground with a
series  of  hypotheses  and  tested  its  assumptions.  Potential  customers  have
validated  the  product,  and  a  base  of  prospects  has  evolved.  And  all  the
learning is captured in writing in the updated business model canvas and its
supporting  hypothesis  documents.  Now  it’s  time  to  honestly  assess  if  the
modified hypotheses provide a sound foundation for moving forward—not to
launch—to a larger-scale test in customer validation.

Summary questions to review and discuss:

Have we identified a problem lots of customers will eagerly pay to have
solved?

Does  our  product  solve  these  needs  distinctively,  cost-effectively  and
profitably?

If so, do we have a sizable market and a viable, scalable and profitable
business model?

Can we draw a day in the life of our customer before and after purchase
of our product?

Can we create an organizational chart of users, buyers and channels?

The  hardest  question  is  simple  and  needs  an  honest  answer:  do  the
customer discovery findings point to a big enough market that’s hungry for
the product? This is often a painful question and, sadly, more often than not

leads back almost to the beginning of customer discovery. While it’s a defeat
of  sorts,  it’s  far  better  to  confront  this  question  honestly  and  candidly,
ensuring  that  the  business  model,  properly  executed,  points  to  a  repeatable,
scalable, profitable business opportunity. Without one, the company faces a
painful road to ignominy.

Exhausting  as  the  customer  discovery  process  is,  it  often  requires
multiple  iterations  to  fully  understand  the  market  and  discover  customers
who can’t wait to buy. However, it’s never been easy to find the Holy Grail.
Until you do, take everything learned in Phases 1 through 3 to heart, modify
the presentations, go back to Phase 1 and do it again. Try out several markets
and  users.  Does  the  team  need  to  reconfigure  or  repackage  the  product
offering?  If  so,  modify  the  product  presentations  and  go  back  to  Phase  3
(solution presentation) and do it again.

If the team votes “all systems go,” there are two more steps to complete

before taking a deep breath and moving forward into customer validation.

Determine the Validation Checkpoints

It’s wonderful to have lots of soft, fuzzy metrics of success, but they seldom
deliver  success  to  startups.  Be  sure  that  every  hypothesis  has  a  clear,
measurable  “validation  checkpoint”  and  that  those  checkpoints  tie  into  the
business  model.  A  few  examples  of  the  kinds  of  checkpoints  to  test  in  the
customer validation phase:

Physical channel/business-to-business checkpoint examples:

We can close a sale in three meetings

One of six prospects will buy if we get to talk to VPs of finance

Customers will expand the number of users of our service by 25 percent
after six months

Customers will place an average of two orders per month

On to Customer Validation? Congratulations!

If you’ve gotten this far, you’ve changed your hypotheses many times. Some

were iterations, others were pivots. One of the best techniques to see how far
you’ve come is to show the canvases as a series of snapshots over time. You
can  do  this  by  putting  them  up  on  the  wall  or  clicking  through  a  series  of
PowerPoint slides. Either way, this visual presentation of the hypotheses and
your  tests  to  turn  those  guesses  into  hard,  cold  facts,  is  the  final  step  in
determining  whether  it’s  time  to  move  on  to  the  next  of  the  four  steps,
customer validation.

If  it’s  time  to  move  to  the  next  step,  congratulations!  This  is  a  major
achievement  and  warrants  celebration.  Customer  discovery  is  the  most
challenging,  powerful  step  you’ll  encounter  in  Customer  Development:
defining  a  product,  an  offer,  a  channel  and  pricing  for  a  product  that
consumers  are  eager  to  buy.  Hold  on  to  all  the  information  collected  from
customer  interviews  for  use  throughout  the  phases  of  customer  validation,
when actual selling will develop a sales roadmap for the company.

Customer  discovery  is  an  exhausting,  sometimes-frustrating  process.
However,  it’s  the  foundation  of  Customer  Development  and  thus  the
foundation  of  a  successful,  scalable  business.  The  checklists  found
throughout  this  book  recap  the  phases  of  this  step,  the  goals  of  each  phase,
and  the  deliverables  proving  that  the  goals  have  been  met.  With  that  done,
take  a  well-earned  vacation  or  a  long  weekend  to  celebrate.  You’ll  need  to
rest up before moving on to customer validation.

Introduction to Customer Validation

Along the journey we commonly forget its goal.

—Friedrich Nietzsche

in 

E.PIPHANY’S  FOUNDING  HYPOTHESES  WERE  typically  pretty  straightforward
and  “investable” 
the  mid-1990s,  when  software  companies  were
automating everything from accounts payable to network security, sales force
processes and even wine-cellar inventories. “Why not automate the marketing
department?” asked the founders, meeting in their modest living room. “After
all, most of the tasks like press releases and data sheets and customer letters
are repeatable processes.” Venture capital was raised and the company began
to build its product based on the founders’ vision.

However,  the  company’s  initial  idea  of  who  the  customer  was  and  the
problem  they  wanted  to  solve  was  just  plain  wrong.  The  company’s  later
success was due to the four passionate entrepreneurs’ willingness to listen to
customers and to the three painful pivots driven by customer feedback.

The Browser Breakthrough

During the ’90s, large corporations acquired different software applications to
automate  each  part  of 
their  enterprise—finance,  customer  support,
manufacturing,  and  sales  among  them.  But  the  data  these  applications
collected  were  accessed  via  reporting  tools  from  the  IT  organization.  More
important,  the  data  existed  in  “virtual  silos,”  with  each  functional  system
walled off from the other. The finance system didn’t talk to the sales system,
which didn’t know that the manufacturing system even existed. Queries like
“Compare  the  sales  data  of  green  dresses  versus  blue  ones  with  current
inventory  for  each  by  store,  and  contrast  the  gross  margin  by  region  to
calculate  discounts”  were  virtually  impossible  to  answer  to  because  they

required combining data from three incompatible applications. As a result, it
could often take days or even weeks to get a simple inventory-detail report.

then-radical 

E.piphany’s 

notion  was 

provide  managers
anytime/anywhere drill-downs and analysis in real time, without IT, through
a revolutionary new technology called a web browser. One of the company’s
key hypotheses was that the product should be a great fit for companies with
lots of customers, tons of data on each one, and a recurring need for fast new
data-driven, microsegmented marketing campaigns.

to 

An Epiphany at E.piphany

Early on, E.piphany assembled an advisory board. A key adviser was the VP
of database marketing at Schwab. She was incredibly generous with her time
and  said  the  system  might  work  in  their  application.  She  introduced  the
company  to  five  other  database  marketing  executives,  who  essentially  said,
“If you get a system working at Schwab, we’ll have to buy one as well.” You
couldn’t  get  much  better 
its  first
earlyvangelist and first market.

that.  E.piphany  had  found 

than 

But each time Schwab’s people looked at the system’s technical details,
they  politely  said  our  product  was  missing  a  key  feature  for  database
marketing. It took two meetings before the founders realized they understood
her  problem,  all  right,  but  the  solution—the  underlying  database  schema  of
the software—was missing the most important feature for solving it. It didn’t
include  “householding,”  and  without  this  feature,  she  could  never  buy  the
E.piphany  system.  (Householding,  well-known  among  database  marketers,
recognizes that two or more people at the same physical address live together
and,  in  Schwab’s  case,  often  invest  together.  This  feature  was  crucial  to
direct-marketers  who  didn’t  want  to  send  multiple  or  differing  ads  to  the
same  address.)  And  no  amount  of  sales  and  marketing  hand-waving  was
going to fix the problem.

It  was  a  major  mistake.  Until  this  meeting,  the  founders  hadn’t
understood the customer problem well enough to provide the correct solution.
E.piphany’s  co-founders,  Ben  Wegbreit  and  Steve  Blank,  joined  the
Schwab VP, and her engineering team in a deep technical discussion of what
the software needed to do for Schwab’s business and what was needed. Ben
asked five or 10 questions, everybody nodded and the meeting ended. On the
long ride back to E.piphany’s living-room office, Steve asked, “Ben, how do

we solve Schwab’s problem?”

After  a  moment  of  silence,  he  replied,  “Show  them  page  6  of  our

product spec.”

“What do you mean page 6? Our spec only has five pages!”
Ben looked at Steve and smiled. “Not anymore.”
They had just pivoted the product and refined the minimum feature set.
E.piphany’s  first  order  from  Schwab  came  the  week  after  they  demo’ed
householding.  Other  orders  followed  soon  after.  A  week  later,  the  founders
sat down to figure out what other feature they would toss out to make room
for this one.

E.piphany  would  go  through  two  additional  equally  painful  pivots
before  its  initial  public  offering,  but  that  “householding”  pivot  sold  the
founders on the “power of the pivot” value.

The  meeting  and  car  ride  from  Schwab  to  the  company  headquarters
illustrates the customer validation process every startup needs: a method for
validating the business model with real customers and orders.

Customer  validation  turns  hypotheses  into  facts  about  basic  questions

like:
     •   Do we understand the sales/user acquisition process?

   Is it repeatable?
   Can we prove it’s repeatable? (If our business model is single-sided
commerce, the only acceptable proof is enough full-price orders.)

   Can we get these orders/users with the current product?

     •   Have we tested sales and distribution channels?
     •   Are we confident we can scale orders/users into a profitable business?
     •   Have we correctly positioned the product and the company?

The Customer Validation Philosophy

Customer validation attempts to “test sell” at every stage. It runs a continuing
series  of  quantitative  pass/fail  tests  to  determine  whether  there’s  strong
enough  product/market  fit  to  justify  scaling  sales  and  marketing  spending.
Most  of  your  testing  effort  will  be  asking  people  to  give  you  an  order  or
engage  with  your  app  or  website.  At  this  point,  you’re  testing  the  entire
business model, not its individual components, even as you learn more details
about some, like price or channel.

Just as customer discovery was disorienting for experienced marketers,

          
          
          
the customer validation process turns the world upside down for experienced
salespeople  and,  in  particular,  those  with  sales  responsibility.  All  the  rules
sales executives learned while selling in physical channels at large companies
are not applicable to startups. In fact, they’re positively detrimental. It’s not
all about the launch party!

In  the  customer  validation  step,  you  are  not  going  to  hire  and  staff  a
sales  team.  You  are  not  going  to  execute  to  a  sales  plan  or  “the  sales
strategy.” The reality  is that  you  don’t  know  enough  yet  to  do  any  of  these
things. At the end of customer discovery, you have in hand firm hypotheses
about who will buy, why they will buy, and at what price they will buy. But
until those hypotheses are validated—with customer orders—they’re all little
more than educated guesses, even with the work invested to develop them.

From Business Model Canvas to the Sales Roadmap

In  customer  discovery  you  tested  some  of  the  hypotheses  of  your  business
model:

Value proposition: You affirmed it with a few dozen to a few hundred
people

Customer segments: You have a hypothesis about customer archetypes

Customer  relationships:  You  tested  several  “get,  keep  and  grow”
activities

Channel:  You  understand  your  key  channel  partners,  and  some  have
expressed interest

Revenue model: The company has an idea of how to price its offering

A  sales  roadmap  uses  all  you’ve  learned  from  customer  discovery  to
guide the creation of a sales funnel specifically for your company. It answers:

Who influences a sale? Who recommends a sale?

Who is the decision-maker? Who is the economic buyer? The saboteur?

Where is the budget for purchasing the type of product you’re selling?

How many sales calls are needed to make one sale?

How long does an average sale take from beginning to end?

What is the selling strategy? Is this a solution sale?

If so, what are “key customer problems?”

What’s the profile of optimal visionary buyers, the earlyvangelists every
startup needs?

Unless a company has proven answers to these questions, few sales will
happen, and those that do occur will result from heroic single-shot efforts. Of
course, on some level, most sales VPs realize they lack the knowledge they
need to draw a detailed sales roadmap, but most believe they and their newly
hired  sales  team  can  acquire  this  information  while  simultaneously  selling
and closing orders. This is because most executives new to startups confuse
searching for a business model with the execution of a known business model.
A  sales  roadmap  is  part  of  the  search  for  a  business  model.  Only  after  it’s
built can it be executed. Startups can’t learn and discover while they’re busy
executing.  As  we  can  see  from  the  rubble  of  any  number  of  failed  startups,
attempting to execute before you have a sales roadmap in place is pure folly.

Building a Sales Roadmap Versus Building a Sales
Force

Given how critical the validation step is, a CEO’s first instinct is to speed up
the process by spending more on customer acquisition or adding salespeople.
The reality is, this doesn’t speed up the validation phase. In fact, it most often
slows  it  down.  Instead,  you’ll  build  a  roadmap  to  figure  out  how  to  get
repeatable sales (by explicitly testing product/ market fit). Once that’s done,
then build a sales organization.

Developing a sales roadmap is part of the search for
a business model.

In an existing market, customer validation may simply validate that the
sales  VP’s  rolodex  or  contact  list  is  relevant,  and  that  product  performance
metrics the company identified in customer discovery were correct. In a re-

 
segmented, clone or new market, even a rolodex of infinite size (or tripling
the  AdWords  budget)  won’t  substitute  for  a  proven  business  model  and  a
tested sales roadmap.

For  an  experienced  sales  or  business  development  executive,  these
statements  about  customer  validation  are  heretical.  All  the  actions  in
Customer Development we consider to be mistakes are what traditional sales
professionals  have  been  trained  to  do.  It  seems  counterintuitive  and
disorienting. So let’s look more closely at why the first sales in a startup are
so different from later-stage sales or selling in a large company.

Founders Must Lead the Customer Validation
Team

Founders  who  complete  customer  discovery  often  mistakenly  ease  up  and
delegate  customer  validation  activities  to  Sales,  Business  Development,
Marketing  or  Product  Management.  This  is  a  bad  idea.  Middle  and  junior
managers  aren’t  likely  to  be  good  at  customer  validation,  which  requires
creative  searching,  probing,  and  turning  on  a  dime—not  execution  of  a
repeatable process.

Why must the founders lead? First, founders and only founders call the
shots  on  pivoting.  To  do  so,  they  must  hear  about  flaws  in  the  product  or
business  model  directly  from  the  customers.  Nothing  else  has  the  same
impact.  Anyone  other  than  a  founder  who  learns  of  a  serious  product  or
business-plan flaw faces two challenges: he or she doesn’t have the authority
to  pivot,  and  he  or  she  seldom  has  the  courage  to  report  bad  customer
feedback to the founder.

Validation Proceeds at Different Speeds in Different
Channels

It takes far more time to set up visits in a physical channel with prospects in
cellphone  companies  in  Asia  and  Africa  than  to  get  customer  feedback
electronically  for  a  website.  And  more  customers  can  be  reached  via
web/mobile channels than can ever be met face-to-face.

Make Early Sales to Earlyvangelists

In  customer  validation  you  will  target  Earlyvangelists  as  your  first  paying
customers. (If you can’t sell to them, it doesn’t get better over time.)

Constrain Spending in Customer Validation

A  typical  failure  scenario  for  startups  is  premature scaling,  when  there  are
more  salespeople  in  the  field  burning  cash  than  are  needed  while  your
business  model  is  still  unproven.  Or  running  expensive  demand-creation
activities before you’re sure who your customers really are. Too often those
sales  people  are  fired  and  their  marketing  programs  killed  when  the  startup
faces a major pivot after scaling too early. Customer validation delays sales-
and-marketing  hiring  and  spending  until  validation  is  nearly  complete.  This
constraint  is  central  to  the  process,  which  assumes  startups  will  fail  and
iterate often. The spending constraint keeps enough cash in the bank to fund
multiple pivots on the road to success.

Prioritize What Needs to be Validated

Prioritizing  the  business  model  elements  that  need  validating  is  essential  at
the  start  of  customer  validation.  Every  startup  business  model  has  a  zillion
moving parts. Validation can’t possibly measure and affirm every variable or
the  founders  will  be  100  years  old  by  the  time  they’re  ready  to  scale—or,
worse, exit—the business.

The business model canvas is an excellent guide here. Most startups will
focus  on  the  four  core  elements:  value  proposition,  customer  relationships,
channel, and revenue model. This list works for many businesses but not all.
Multi-sided markets need to prioritize all sides of the market. Think about the
five or fewer things that will make this a huge, successful business—or not.

Why Accountants Don’t Run Startups

With all the process steps involved, it’s sometimes hard to remember that the
Customer Development process isn’t a giant focus group. The goal is not to

add  up  all  the  customer  feedback  and  vote  on  what  features  to  implement.
Founders who are artists at heart run startups—the true purpose of Customer
Development  is  to  inform their vision.  (In  a  new  market,  there’s  no  data  at
all!)  A  great  entrepreneur  may  consider  all  the  customer  data,  listen  to  his
instincts and say, “Here’s why I’m going to ignore what we just heard.”

The Customer Validation Philosophy, in Summary

Customer  discovery  first  tested  your  hypotheses  about  the  company’s
business model with a relatively tiny group of customers who were asked for
opinions,  not  orders.  Discovery  itself  didn’t  deliver  any  proven,  hard  facts
about who would buy or how scalable the business was.

Customer  validation  goes  to  the  next  step  and  determines  whether  a
product/market fit can be validated by orders or usage. It does so by further
developing the MVP as well as the company’s sales and marketing plans and
materials. Then it gets founders out of the building (physically, virtually, or
both)  to  test  the  MVP  and  every  other  key  business  model  hypotheses,
including  product  features,  pricing,  channel,  and  positioning.  How?  By
asking for orders (or downloads, logons, or clicks)!

Test the MVP. How? By asking for orders.

Customer validation is complete when the company has answers to these

three questions:

1.  Can  the  business  scale?  Will  a  dollar  spent  on  customer  acquisition
yield  more  than  a  dollar’s  worth  of  incremental  revenue,  page  views,
downloads or clicks?

2.  Is  there  a  repeatable  and  scalable  sales  roadmap?  Does  the  company
know the right prospects to call on or acquire, and what to say to them to
consistently deliver sales?

3.  Is the sales funnel predictable? Do the same sales programs and tactics
consistently  deliver  an  adequate,  profitable  flow  of  customers  through
the funnel?

Now let’s get started.

 
Overview of the Customer Validation Process

Customer Validation: Overview of the Process (Figure 7.1)

Customer Validation has Four Phases

Phase  1  consists  of  six  “get  ready  to  sell”  activities;  product  positioning,
sales/  marketing  materials  for  “test  selling”  efforts,  the  hiring  of  a  sales
closer, the creation of a distribution channel plan, refining a sales roadmap,
and  creating  an  advisory  board.  These  activities  make  your  team  the  best
prepared early stage venture ever to hit the streets.

Phase 2 gets founders out of the building to put the product to the ultimate
test:  will  customers  validate  your  business  model  by  buying  your  product?
You’ll attempt to actually sell customers an unfinished and unproven product
without a professional sales organization. Getting feedback is as important as
getting  orders.  Startups  in  the  physical  channel  do  this  with  brochures,
PowerPoints, sales materials and, where possible, product demos or mockups.
Dozens if not hundreds of meetings help refine the product presentation and
channel plans, validate the sales roadmap, prove the predictability of the sales
funnel,  and  validate  that  the  business  model  is  repeatable,  scalable  and
profitable in a real-world test.

Startups in multi-sided markets (physical or web/mobile) need to get out
of  the  building  to  test  each  side  of  the  market.  Web/Mobile  marketers  first
test users and then validate a different set of hypotheses (value proposition,
segment,  revenue  model,  etc.)  with  the  “payers,”  who  are  marketers  or
advertisers willing to pay to reach people using the site for free.

Phase  3  happens  once  you  have  a  couple  of  orders  under  your  belt  and
enough  customer  information  to  develop  and  refine  your  product  and
company  positioning.  The  positioning  is  tested  in  meetings  with  industry
pundits and analysts and face-to-face with the expanded customer audience.

Phase  4  stops  all  activity  for  long  enough  to  conduct  a  detailed  pivot-or-
proceed analysis and verify that, regardless of channel, customer validation is
complete and the company knows how to scale. If so, it’s ready to reap the
rewards  for  founders  and  investors  alike.  But  first  there  are  lots  of  tough
questions and hard work to verify.

In  sum,  the  question  is  simple:  “is  this  a  business  worth  doing,”  and
devoting  several  years  of  backbreaking  work?  Will  it  generate  enough
revenue,  growth  and  profits  to  achieve  the  founders’  and  investors’  goals?
And has the team learned enough to make it happen?

Odds  are  overwhelming  that  the  optimum  business  model  won’t  be

found on the first or second try in validation.

The moment customer validation is over is when it’s clear that there are
real  orders,  users,  or  clicks—not  surveys  or  chats.  Customer  validation
confirms that customers will accept the minimum viable product, proves that
the customers exist, figures out how to reach them predictably, and crafts a
scalable plan to engage and sell many more. It’s often called the “epiphany
moment.”

CHAPTER 8

Customer Validation, Phase One: “Get
Ready to Sell”

PHASE 1 OF CUSTOMER VALIDATION PREPARES the tools to test the company’s
ability  to  acquire  customers.  In  this  phase,  you’ll  craft  your  product
positioning, which guides how you write the marketing, and online materials
needed for the sales effort. For companies in the physical channel, other steps
in this phase include development of collateral materials, channel sales plans,
and a sales roadmap. Sometimes, a “sales closer” is also hired at this point.
And you’ll finalize your advisory board.

Steps  in  this  first  phase  are  markedly  different  for  each  channel,  so
physical  and  web/mobile  channels  are  addressed  separately,  as  outlined  in
Figure 8.1.

When all these steps are in place, it’s time to get out of the building and
start selling, in Phase 2. Here are the steps each channel requires before you
are ready to sell.

Phase 1 – Get Ready to Sell (Figure 8.1)

Get Ready to Sell: Craft Positioning Statement

From your customer’s perspective, what does your company stand for, what
does your product do, and why should they care? You probably had an idea
when  you  started  the  company,  but  now  you  have  some  real  experience  in
interacting with customers. It’s time to revisit the product vision, features and
competitive  information  in  light  of  what  you’ve  learned  in  customer
discovery.

Can  you  reduce  all  that  you’ve  learned  into  a  single  clear,  compelling
message explaining why your company is different and the product is worth
buying  (or  spending  time  with).  That’s  the  goal  of  a  unique  selling
proposition.  A  unique  selling  proposition  builds  the  bond  between  you  and
your customer, focuses marketing programs, and becomes the focal point for
building the company. More relevant for this step, it gets the company’s story
down to a short “elevator pitch” powerful enough to raise a customer’s heart
rate.  It’ll  appear  in  lots  of  different  places  from  billboards  to  banners  and
business cards from here on out and helps focus sales and marketing efforts.
Don’t  worry  about  getting  it  perfect,  because  it  will  change  with  feedback
from customers, analysts, and investors. For now, take a first best shot.

While  positioning  messaging  seems  straightforward,  it  can  be  a
challenge to execute. It takes serious work to get to a pithy statement that’s
both understandable and compelling. It’s much easier to write (or think) long
than  to  write  (or  think)  short.  Start  by  revisiting  what  customers  said  they
valued during customer discovery. What were the top problems? Did a phrase
keep coming up to describe the problem or solution? Where does the product
affect customers most? How significant is the product’s impact? What does
the  new  offering  provide  that  competitors  can’t  or  won’t?  What  does  it  do
better? Think simple and short at all times. This may be a place where outside
creative resources are worth the investment.

In technology startups, one of the biggest challenges for engineers is to
realize  the  need  for  a  simple  message  that  grabs  customers’  hearts  and
wallets,  not  their  heads  and  calculators.  It’s  not  about  the  product  features.

Seek a simple sentence that condenses the entire value proposition into a few
pithy,  catchy  words  that  say  it  all:  “Think  Different,”  from  Apple;  “Don’t
Leave  Home  Without  It,”  American  Express;  “Just  Do  It,”  Nike;  “We  Try
Harder,”  Avis;  “Earth’s  First  Soft  Drink,”  Perrier;  “The  Ultimate  Driving
Machine,” BMW.

The exercises, in Figures 8.2 and 8.3, developed by Geoffrey Moore (of
Crossing the Chasm fame) early in his career as a marketing consultant, can
help evoke the necessary elements:

Product Positioning Statement (Figure 8.2)

Here’s how a mobile expense-reporting application, Mobiledough, might

have used the product position statement:

Product Positioning Statement Example (Figure 8.3)

What might Mobiledough’s tag line be? A few candidates:

“Your dough, on the go. Fast, accurate, online”

“Track your expenses while you’re makin’ tracks”

“Mobiledough. It just adds up, instantly, online”

Use  the  Geoff  Moore  outline  or  one  like  it  to  brainstorm  positioning
statements  with  the  Customer  Development  team.  Consider  a  companywide
contest  or  creative  session.  To  see  if  the  positioning  is  emotionally
compelling, think about the following:

Do customers’ heart rates go up after they hear it?

Do they lean forward to hear more? Or do you get a blank stare?

Is it understandable in the users’ language or unique in their minds?

For  B-to-B  products,  does  the  positioning  imply  a  cost  or  competitive
advantage for the product?

For  consumer  products,  does  it  save  time  or  money  or  provide  fun  or
love, glamour or status?

Finally, does the positioning pass the reality test? Claims like “lose 30
pounds  in  a  week”  or  “increase  sales  200  percent”  or  “fall  in  love  tonight”
strain  credibility  and  probably  legality  as  well.  Moreover,  it’s  not  only  the
claim that needs to pass this test. Is your company a credible supplier for the
product  you’re  describing?  When  selling  to  corporate  customers,  there  are
additional hurdles to think about. Are your capabilities congruent with your
claims?

One  last  thing  to  keep  in  mind  is  our  continual  question  about  what
market type you’re in. If you’re offering a product in an existing market, your
unique selling proposition is about better, faster, or higher performance. It’s
framed by what you’ve learned from countless customer interviews about the
basis of competition..

If  you’re  creating  a  new  market  or  trying  to  reframe  an  existing  one,
you’ll probably come up with a transformational unique selling proposition.
Transformational unique selling propositions deal with how the solution will
create a new level or class of activity—i.e., something people could never do
before.

Get Ready to Sell: Sales and Marketing Materials

Acquiring customers in the physical channel evolves in a four-stage process:
awareness,  consideration,  interest,  and  purchase.  To  facilitate  this  sales
process, you’ll use the unique selling proposition you created in the last step
to produce sales and marketing materials—product data sheets, presentations,
a website, etc.—called “marketing collateral.” Your sales team will hand or
present  this  collateral  to  potential  customers  and/or  on  your  website  to
communicate the reasons customers should buy.

The “Get Customers” Funnel in Physical Channels (Figure 8.4)

In the physical channel, the job of marketing materials is not to close the
sale but to drive prospective customers into the sales funnel, where physical
locations,  live  salespeople,  and  supporting  selling  materials  take  over  and
effect a transaction. The material should give people enough information to
raise  their  curiosity  and  spark  an  interaction  with  sales—but  not  so  much
information that they can decide not to buy without first interacting with the

channel! Human helpers need a variety of tools to close the deal, and this step
plans and creates a first version of the tool set that helps close the deal.

This section describes online tools, physical sales tools and how to tune

both for your audience.

Much  of  the  information  for  the  materials  (product  features,  benefits,
specs)  is  found  in  the  hypotheses  developed  and  refined  during  customer
discovery. Don’t spend money on flashy design or large print runs, but keep
the  materials  crisp  and  professional,  knowing  they’ll  change  based  on
customer feedback.

“Get Customers” Tools for Physical Channels (Table 8.1)

Physical Sales Collateral and Materials

Once they arrive in the physical channel, whether they’re driven by the web,
Twitter, or an old-fashioned newspaper ad, the customer eventually gets face-
to-face with a salesperson. When he does, sales materials and tools are often
required.  Instead  of  randomly  writing  product  specs  and  presentations,

develop a “collateral plan” listing all the items needed at each sales-process
stage (see  Table 8.2  for  an  example).  A  basic  minimum  collateral  checklist
for almost any company should include the following items:

website

PowerPoint sales presentation

Demos, prototypes and videos

Data sheets

Price lists, contracts and billing systems

Don’t  forget  the  more  obvious  items:  white  papers,  company  press
clippings, customer testimonials, letterhead, presentation folders and business
cards!

Sales Presentations

Sales  presentations  should  deliver  an  updated,  integrated  version  of  the
problem,  solution  and  product  presentations  developed  during  customer
discovery, guided by the new positioning. The core audience during customer
validation is earlyvangelists, not mainstream customers. Cover a brief outline
of the problem, possible existing solutions, and your proposed new solution,
and  then  product  details.  The  presentation  should  run  no  more  than  30
minutes.  In  customer  discovery,  you  may  have  found  that  different
presentations  were  required,  depending  on  the  type  of  people  who  played  a
role  in  purchase  decisions  inside  a  company  or  with  different  types  of
consumer  audiences.  Were  separate  presentations  required  for  senior
management  and  lower-level  employees?  How  about  for  a  technical
audience?  How  about  for  different  companies  in  different  industries?  For
consumer  products,  was 
there  a  different  presentation  based  on
demographics? Income? Geography?

A  worthwhile  investment  at  this  stage  of  Customer  Development  is
professional help in developing a PowerPoint template. It gives the company
a professional, established appearance even if the office remains a garage or a
basement.

Demos/Prototypes/Video

Most  people  you’re  trying  to  sell  to  don’t  have  your  skill  in  visualizing
products  that  don’t  exist.  It’s  why  you’re  the  founder  and  they’re  not.  For
many people, most product concepts are too hard to understand without some
kind  of  demo  or  prototype.  Wherever  possible,  prepare  some  kind  of
prototype,  working  or  not,  that  illustrates  how  the  product  operates  and  its
key  selling  points.  At  a  minimum,  provide  a  slide-based,  nonworking
illustration  or  a  short  video.  Ideally,  the  presentation  illustrates  the  old  way
and  the  new  way  of  solving  the  problem.  It  can  be  made  of  cardboard  or
Styrofoam, or it can be a series of simple sketches, but it should “bring the
product  to  life”  wherever  possible.  Product  development  teams  in  physical-
product  startups  sometimes  confuse  demos  with  working  products.  They’re
not.

It’s  these  demos  that  “turn  on  the  lightbulb”  over  the  heads  of  many

earlyvangelists and get their passionate about the product.

Data Sheets

It’s  easy  to  confuse  product  data  sheets,  which  detail  product  features  and
benefits, with solution data sheets, which address customer problems and big-
picture  solutions.  Which  ones  you  need  depend  on  market  type.  When
entering  an  existing  market,  your  focus  is  on  the  product  and  why  yours  is
better. Here, product data sheets are the best way to illustrate that. However,
if you’re creating a new market or cloning a market, the solution data sheets
are  more  appropriate.  If  you’re  re-segmenting  a  market,  both  types  of  data
sheets are essential.

Price Lists, Contracts and Billing System

Hopefully  by  now,  someone  has  asked,  “How  much  does  it  cost?”  Prepare
price  lists,  quote  forms,  and  contracts.  These  documents  makes  a  small
startup look like a real company. They also force codification of assumptions
about  product  pricing,  configurations,  delivery,  discounts,  and  terms.
Consumer  products  require  a  way  to  take  early  orders,  usually  involving

credit card processing, e-commerce tools, and more.

Collateral Needs to Be Tuned to the Audience

In  validation,  startups  selling  in  business-to-business  markets  have  two
different audiences for collateral materials: the earlyvangelist, the technology
gatekeepers  and  each  require  different  messages  and  materials  (see  Table
8.2). Earlyvangelists buy the vision first and then buy the product. Therefore,
make sure materials are clear and detailed enough about vision and benefits
to  help  earlyvangelists  sell  the  idea  by  themselves,  after  the  presentation
ends, inside their companies or to friends or family.

Most business-to-business selling situations require a technical overview
with  a  distinctly  deeper  level  of  information  for  other  players  in  the  sales
cycle.  Issue-specific  white  papers  can  address  particular  areas  of  interest  or
concern. Develop these as they become necessary but not before. Customers
will tell you what they need. Especially in tight economic climates, business
customers  might  require  a  return-on-investment  (ROI)  white  paper.  It’s  a
customer’s  fancy  way  of  saying,  “Show  me  how  I  financially  justify  this
purchase. Will it save me money in the long run?” Much of the development
work  for  this  was  done  as  part  of  the  customer  discovery  process.
Earlyvangelist champions will usually have to pitch the product to others in
their  company—often  without  startup  spokespeople  present—before
someone agrees to sign the check. For consumers the issue is the same; just
imagine kids trying to make the ROI issue for an iPad. “I won’t have to carry
DVD’s in the car, and promise to read more books if you buy them for me.”

On  the  other  hand,  startups  selling  in  business-to-consumer  marketers
focus  the  collateral  on  materials  for  the  sales  channel:  shelf-talkers,  retail
packaging,  coupons,  and  ad  slicks.  The  collateral  plan  distinguishes
objectives, targets for, and timing of each piece.

Test-drive all the collateral, because what’s written in the confines of an
office often has little relevance in the field. A/B-test online “collateral” such
as  landing  pages,  checkout  pages,  and  product  feature/benefit  statements  as
ambitiously  as  possible  (more  on  this  in  the  next  section).  Consumers  and
business  buyers  have  no  obligation  to  memorize  the  company’s  jargon  or
understand “inside jokes.” Keep the collateral plan handy. Update and add to
it along the way.

Example of a Business-to-Business, Direct-Sales Collateral Plan
(Table 8.2)

Online Tools for Physical Channel Marketers

Even  if  the  company’s  principal  channel  strategy  involves  physical
distribution customers still search for products online, you’ll need an array of
basic  online  tools  to  generate  awareness  and  trials  and  to  provide  product
information on the web. These tools almost always include a website, some
kind  of  viral  marketing  program  to  find  customers,  and  digital  forms  of
brochures  or  other  selling  materials.  In  addition,  social  networks  have
become  huge  sources  of  customers,  even  for  the  most  mundane  physical

goods, and lots of new product ideas surface every day in Twitter streams.

Even the most complicated “old world” products
are promoted through websites and online
marketing.

Even  the  most  complicated  “old  world”  products  like  construction
equipment  and  materials  are  promoted  through  expansive  websites  and
massive  online  marketing  programs.  As  a  result,  marketers  in  the  physical
channel must explore and develop online customer-acquisition and marketing
plans even if their pumps, bushings and gravel are sold only over the counter
in a dingy warehouse. Warehouse or not, today’s buyer will often search for
those products online.

Modern marketing is as much about “pulling” customers to a product as
it  is  about  “pushing”  that  service  at  them.  For  example,  an  e-mail  in  your
inbox or a sales rep at your desk is there to push a product at you. Samples at
a  Costco  display  or  search  engines  invite,  or  pull,  you  toward  the  product,
encouraging you to explore it voluntarily because it’s aroused your interest.
Strong marketing campaigns and tools should be blended to do a good job of
both push and pull marketing.

Here are some guidelines to consider in preparing those materials.

Websites

At  this  stage,  websites  for  companies  using  the  physical  channel  should
provide  clear  information  on  the  company’s  vision  and  the  problem  it  was
founded to solve. Your job in this step is to learn how much detailed product
information can pull the customer in to facilitate a sale. At a minimum, the
website’s job is to arouse interest in and spark consideration of the product or
company  and  to  drive  interested  prospects  into  the  physical  sales  channel.
(For low-dollar-item products, you can even have the website close the sale.)
However, the website shouldn’t provide customers with reasons not to buy (it
shouldn’t display details about price, installation requirements, etc). It should
instead encourage interested prospects to interact with the company. Use the
site to collect as much information as the prospect will provide. (Remember,

 
response rates drop in direct proportion to the number of “required fields” in
a sign-up form.)

Social Marketing Tools

Many companies that sell physical products exclusively in a physical channel
use  Facebook  pages,  Twitter  streams,  and  other  social  marketing  tools  to
spread  the  word  and  attract  customers.  They  also  use  these  online  tools  to
invite customers and prospects to introduce products to their colleagues and
friends.  Making  all  this  readily  available  and  promoting  it  ambitiously  is  a
relatively inexpensive way to accelerate the Get process. (Details about these
tools are found in Chapter 3, and later in this chapter.)

E-mail and e-mailable Marketing Tools

E-mail messages are an important tool for communicating with prospects and
customers  online,  since  they  can  be  targeted  and  often  individualized  based
on  what  you  know  about  them.  When  crafted  carefully  to  provide  useful
information beyond a flat-out sales pitch, they can break through the cluttered
inboxes  of  even  the  most  cynical  prospects.  Create  e-mail  messages  and
campaigns that reflect what you know about the individual and design multi-
e-mail campaigns for optimum impact. Create digital versions of brochures,
white papers, and other sales materials to accompany the e-mails themselves.
(Learn more about e-mail campaigns in the customer-relationships section of
Chapter 3.)
Note to reader: Although tailored to web/mobile startups, the following pages
include tips and guidelines that physical startups will find useful.

Get Ready to Sell: Acquire/Activate Customers
Plan (Web/Mobile)

Remember that “Get” activity is very different in web/mobile: you must
attract customers to your site, app, or product or they won’t even know you
exist!  Review  this  section,  which,  in  brief,  says:  figure  out  where  your
customers go when they’re searching for a solution; be visible and inviting in
as  many  of  those  places  as  possible;  and  “earn”  their  visit  to  your  product
with helpful, friendly information, not hard-boiled sales pitches.

“Get Customers” Tools for Web/Mobile Channels (Table 8.3)

The “Acquire” Plan and Tools

The Acquire plan is short, to-the-point, and tactical in nature. The plan helps
you  find  tools  that  predictably  deliver  large  numbers  of  “good”  customers
(who engage with or spend heavily on the site or app) into the widest point of
the funnel (at the left) at the lowest cost per customer.

The “Get Customers” Funnel in Web/Mobile Channels (Figure 8.5)

 
WARNING: There is no possible way you can read, process and act on
this  section  in  one  read.  There’s  a  lot  here.  Skim  it  first,  then  go  back
and read each section. Then think about what action you need to take for
your startup.

The Acquire plan (see sample plan) should fit on a single page. It details

the first set of Acquire activities to test and includes:

Who: Who’s responsible for driving the program; who will add support
or expertise

What: Describe the tactic and its parts (see below for a list of tools)

Budget: Estimate of spending for the first round of testing

Timing: Outline the steps needed to launch (our example in Figure 8.6
uses a four-week cycle)

Why: Specific, measurable acquisition goals of each plan element

The  acquire  plan  and  tactics  will  change  repeatedly,  since  in  customer

validation they’re basically a series of experiments.

The acquire plan and tactics will change
repeatedly... they’re basically a series of
experiments.

In  a  physical  consumer  channel  like  Walmart,  marketers  seldom  know
which  consumers  see,  touch,  or  buy  any  particular  product.  But  in  the
web/mobile  channels,  every  aspect  of  consumer  behavior  can  be
instrumented,  analyzed  and,  often  as  not,  optimized  to  improve  business
performance. Be sure your product is instrumented to track every consumer
action or inaction. Without building the instrumentation upfront, optimizing
your acquisition activities is more challenging, if not downright impossible.

A Sample Acquire Spreadsheet

 
 
Shown in Figure 8.6 is a sample of part of an Acquire plan for a web startup
with a small budget. The plan is built around a few key assumptions:

     Who: Two staffers are needed, one full-time and one half-time

     What: The tactics, chosen by the team, seem best-suited to maximizing

leads and sales (see next section for a list of tools)

     Budget: The startup has about $25,000 to spend for this

A Sample Acquire Plan and Timetable (Figure 8.6)

     Timing: The team is allowing itself four weeks to prepare all elements for

the launch of validation

     Why: The goal is to get 30,000 to 35,000 customers to download a free
trial and to get 15 percent of them to convert to paying customers. This
would achieve a customer acquisition cost of about $5, as suggested in
this plan’s revenue model hypothesis

     Multi-sided or not?: Does your product have both users and payers? If so,

a multi-sided market requires a separate plan for each “side” of its
market. Users will be acquired one way, while reaching and selling
advertisers will demand a totally different approach. (Our sample is a
single-sided market)

Guidelines for Developing the Acquire Plan

Determining  whom  to  acquire  (i.e.,  which  customers,)  what  promotional
tactics to use, and what to say and how to say it (the content and messaging)
is made easy because you did most of the research and planning in customer
discovery.  Start  this  plan  by  referring  back  to  three  hypothesis  documents
you devised when you created and tested your original business model canvas
hypotheses:

Customer  segments:  customers  to  be  reached  (which  guides  e-mail,
targeting of marketing activities, ads, and PR)

Customer relationships: how customers will be reached (SEO, PPC, e-
mail, PR, etc.)

Value  proposition:  what  will  excite  customers  and  persuade  them  to
engage, visit or buy

Don’t be afraid to update or change the hypotheses based on the latest
feedback or even instinct at this point, since they’re still just “best guesses”
confirmed by only a few customers. Other guidelines to keep in mind:

Remember  that  this  is  a  test  to  figure  out  which  tools  work  and  cost-
effectively  when  they’re  launched  during  customer  creation,  the  next
step. This is not a company or product launch. Your goal is learning, not
revenue, so don’t be afraid to test lots of alternatives

Define  success  upfront  for  each  test,  using  a  pass/fail  metric  (such  as
“one in five people will click”), and monitor results

Be the greatest, friendliest, coolest thing going. Your job is to attract or
invite  customers  to  your  product,  site,  or  app,  so  be  interesting  and
welcoming (and, if appropriate, even fun or funny) rather than not just
offering a hard, cold sale. Think like your customers, and be prominent
and  visible  where  you  think  they’ll  be  searching  for  a  solution  like
yours. (Think about forums and online communities)

Running tests without collecting data is a cardinal
sin.

Instrument  everything.  Running  tests  without  collecting  data  is  a
cardinal  sin.  Engineering  needs  to  spend  the  extra  effort  to  collect  all
customer  behavior  data  so 
it  can  be  measured  and  optimized
continuously. Confront this upfront, as it’s hard to “bolt on” later

Don’t  start  everything  at  once,  since  that  will  create  chaos  both  in  the
market  and  in  the  company.  For  example,  start  search  engine
optimization  and  pay-per-click  tests  on  Day  Five,  and  add  e-mail  and
affiliate  marketing  programs  two  or  three  weeks  later.  The  individual,
program-by-program results will be easier to identify and measure

Don’t  spend  more  than  $2,000  or,  if  well-funded,  $10,000  to  test  any
one thing. The startup usually can’t afford it at this stage, and the risks
of guessing wrong are too great

When a test seems to be working, ramp it up to be sure it withstands the
test  of  scale.  If  a  $2,000  e-mail  marketing  campaign  is  performing,
double it, refine it and do it again

Choose  agency  partners  very  carefully,  if  at  all.  The  costs  and
management  time  needed  to  hire  a  pr,  ad,  or  web  agency  this  early  in
your startup make it a very risky proposition. Most often, agencies are
great  at  execution  of  programs  but  not  at  developing  and  testing
strategies. Rely on founders and staff where possible, as they know the
product  and  the  business  model  best.  Consider  freelance  talent

 
specialized in developing tests and strategies or those who specialize in
specific tasks (e.g., pay-per-click, demos and other specialized skills) if
they don’t exist within the company

Don’t launch the Acquire effort by itself.  Activation  programs  must  be
ready  to  “catch”  the  customers  you’ve  acquired,  so  if  there’s  copy
saying, “Sign up today and get a free box of chocolates,” for example,
the site’s back-end system has to be operating, the chocolates have to be
ready to ship, and copy for the thank-you e-mail must be ready to go. If
you’re  taking  customers’  money,  all  back-end  systems  need  to  be
working,  including  such  elements  as  receipts,  credit-card  processing,
and customer service. Similarly, site and app instrumentation must be up
and  running,  tested  and  feeding  the  management  dashboard  so  it  can
measure the behavior of every customer who passes through the funnel.
Remember that acquisition by itself is one of several integrated pieces of
the  “Get”  strategy  (there’s  also  activation,  retention,  and  “grow
customers,” to name a few).

The acquisition plan is managed through close monitoring of every step
customers  take  as  they  move  through  the  sales  or  “get  customers”  funnel.
That monitoring, generally in a dashboard, enables constant effort to improve
performance  or  “throughput”—customers  movement  from  one  step  to  the
next—at  every  step  of  the  funnel,  using  tools  detailed  in  the  next  section,
“optimizing the acquire plan.”

Acquire Plan Tools

Acquisition tools you can buy

The  list  of  customer  acquisition  tools  you  can  buy  and  use  is  virtually
endless,  but  their  customer  impact  and  effectiveness  vary  over  time.
Acquisition  is  a  numbers  game  based  on  your  ability  to  cost-effectively
deliver large volumes of customers to your site or app. Basic tools include:

search-engine marketing

e-mail marketing

outreach to bloggers

affiliate marketing

online lead generation

customer incentives

WARNING: There is no possible way you can read, process and act on
this  section  in  one  read.  There’s  a  lot  here.  Skim  it  first,  then  go  back
and read each section. Then think about what action you need to take for
your startup.

In  the  activation  step,  users  decide—all  by  themselves—whether  to
engage with or buy your product, and the decision is often made in a matter
of seconds. So the home or landing page must work hard and fast to activate
newly  acquired  “lookers,”  converting  them  into  buyers,  users,  or  tryers.
(Activation  sometimes  happens  in  an  app  store,  via  e-mail,  through  the
channel, or by telephone.) If you can’t get people to activate at once, ideally
you can get them to at least sign up so they can perhaps be persuaded to try,
engage, or buy later.

 
 
The landing page is where activation most often begins. (Figure 8.7)

Wherever  the  customer  arrives,  he  or  she  typically  knows  little  if
anything  about  where  he  or  she  has  just  landed.  Here’s  what  you  need  to
address to activate a customer, using an oversimplified example of what goes
through the visitor’s mind on arrival:

Why am I here? They want me to buy this new online multiplayer game

What makes it special? Oh, here’s a feature list and reasons to buy

How do I know it’s any good? Here’s a demo, list of endorsements, user
quotes, etc.

Where  do  I  get  more  information?  I  see  buttons  pointing  to  free  trials,
more info, etc.

Next?  What  does  the  company  want  me  to  do?  Oh,  click  here  to  try/
buy/sign up

Guidelines for Developing the “Activate” Plan

In the customer validation phase, the activation plan is really a test plan, A/B-
testing  every  key  aspect  of  the  home/landing  page,  from  color  and  copy  to
offers  and  navigation.  It’s  OK  to  start  with  approximations  or  guesses,  but
they should iterate rapidly based on measured customer responses.

Should  a  landing-page  offer  scream  “free”  or  subtly  ask  for  a  credit
card?  Should  the  “buy  now”  button  be  elegant  and  on  top  or  bright  orange
and  huge  in  the  lower  right-hand  corner?  Does  an  animated  product  demo
activate more users than a simple graphic? There are scores if not hundreds of
variables  on  almost  any  home  page,  and  many  tests  must  be  repeated  more
than  once  to  confirm  results.  Outside  information  architects  and  design
professionals can help. They understand the range of tools available as well
as the latest tricks of the trade in this highly creative process.

The  list  of  tools,  tricks,  and  variables  to  try  is  nearly  endless,  and  it’s
hard  to  predict  which  ones  will  win.  That’s  why  repeated  testing  and
measurement are so important, following the “test, measure, tweak” approach
discussed earlier.

Here’s what an activation plan should include:

Two types of action steps: Activation happens both on and off the home
page, so create two separate lists of the “Get” customers activities you
plan to test (like offering a premium with every signup)

First/second  test:  This  is  customer  discovery,  where  you’re  running
small-scale  tests  of  your  activation  programs.  Each  of  those  programs
needs to be tested at least twice, if not far more frequently, as you try to
find the program that’ll generate the most users or customers. Identify at
least the first two tests

Pass/fail test: Every test should have a “pass/fail,” or an expectation that
defines  what  “success”  will  look  like  if  you  have  it.  Based  on
experience, trials, or research, identify the metric that’ll determine if the
experiment was a success

An “Activate” Plan Example

Most  activation  happens  on  the  home  or  landing  page,  where  you’re  doing
anything you can to get a user or customer you’ve acquired (he or she came
to your page) and trying to engage them—get them to click, sign up, post a
comment, play, or buy.

The home page is “where the action is” for
activation.

And while the home page is “where the action is” for activation, there
are other things you can also do—like send follow-up e-mails, for example—
to further engage someone who’s expressed more than a passing interest.

Table 8.4 is a simplified example of what an activation plan might look
like for a social network where new golfers can offer and solicit improvement
tips. In this example, since the business is in a multi-sided market, activation
goals  include  such  non-monetary  actions  as  registration,  inviting  friends,
asking a question or answering one.

 
Sample Activation Plan for a Golfers’ Social Network (Table 8.4)

Tools for the Activate plan

Activation happens both on and off the home page. Key tools to consider for
each are in the bullet points that follow.

On the home or landing page

The  landing  page  itself  offers  lots  of  ways  to  drive  activations,  including
content, look and feel, and navigation. It can also showcase these activation
tools:

product demos

free trials

customer contact tools

animation

Non-home page acquisition tools

While the home page is the primary activation tool, consider these others too:

e-mail cascades

price/incentives

traditional tools

On the home or landing page itself:
Start with Content, Look and Feel, Functionality
and Navigation

Good  landing  pages  bear  little  resemblance  to  online  brochures.  They’re
invitations to “activate now,” working hard to invite customers to engage or
interact with—or buy—the product. This must happen literally at once, often
in seconds. Otherwise the customer (and the money spent to acquire him or
her  in  the  previous  step)  vanishes  with  the  click  of  a  mouse.  Develop  the
home/landing page along four axes:

1.  Content: Does the site present everything for a customer needs to make
the  “activation”  decision  simply,  in  multiple  places  (for  example,  does
every page say “join now”)? Is it friendly, informative, and inviting?

2.  Look and feel: Does the appearance relate to the audience (“corporate”
for  business  apps,  “serious”  for  financial  sites,  “edgy”  for  teen  or
skateboarding  products)?  Does  it  match  the  typical  style  of  the
demographic or their country?

3.  Functionality:  What  tools,  widgets,  configurators,  demos  or  other
devices can quickly engage customers, get them experimenting with and
experiencing the product itself, and figuring out what it costs, how much
time it would save, or how the game plays?

4.  Navigation/structure: How is information organized? How accessible is
it?  How  easy  is  it  for  users  to  complete  high-value  tasks  (ordering,
searching, etc.)?

Here’s how to approach each area.
Home/Landing Page Content:

          •      Tell  me  how  I  got  here!  Users  arrive  at  the  home/landing  page  in  a
variety  of  ways  (clicks,  e-mails,  referrals),  but  don’t  assume  they
know  where  they’ve  landed.  Welcome  them;  explain  the  site
(“Welcome  to  the  No.  1  online  gaming  portal.”)  to  avoid  fast
abandonment

     •   Reinforce the “scent” of the e-mail, ad, or tool that drove the customer
to  the  page.  Use  similar  verbiage  (and  look  and  feel)  to  increase
confidence that the viewer has come to the right place

          •      Issue  a  clear  call  to  action.  The  “pitch,”  or  call  to  action,  tells  the
customer what you want him or her to do. It should reflect positioning
developed in Stage 1 of validation, whether it’s “buy now,” “sign up,”
or  “attend  a  seminar.”  Use  redundant  calls  to  action  wherever  you
can, but be sure they’re not confusing. Clearly tell visitors what to do
and  why  doing  so  delivers  value  to  them.  The  landing  page  should
always accomplish the following:

   Explain what problem the product solves and why it’s important to

users and worthy of their attention

   Communicate ease of use and installation for the product

   Clearly explain how the product works

   Provide fast proof that it works (user quotes, competitive analysis,

demos, etc.)

Calls to action appear three ways on a home/landing page: hyperlinks,
buttons,  and  forms.  They  should  stand  out  and  be  obvious  to  every  visitor.
Highlight product features that make the most powerful pitch for activation or
purchase, and always provide easy access to more information about all the
above.

Some guidelines for home or landing page content development:

Encourage  me  to  “experience  the  offer:”  Never  think  of  the  landing
page  as  a  brochure.  It’s  effective  only  if  it  encourages  customer

          
          
          
          
engagement,  trial,  or  purchase.  All  content  should  invite  involvement,
and  offers  should  be  judiciously  sprinkled  throughout  headlines,
graphics  and  text,  including  “try  now”  textlinks  embedded  at  least
occasionally in body copy

Offer multiple calls to action ranging from “buy now” and “learn more”
to  “download  our  white  paper”  and  “talk  to  someone.”  Remember  to
make  one  of  these  far  more  prominent  than  all  the  others—the  action
most desired by the company

Write  short!  Web  visitors  are  very  fragile,  temporary  guests.  Respect
their  short  attention  spans  and  get  to  the  point  before  they  depart.  The
best  calls  to  action  are  generally  written  in  10  or  fewer  words  and
displayed in an easily readable font

Be specific. One of the most powerful page elements should be the core
in  Step  1  of  customer
product-positioning  statement  developed 
validation.  Succinctly  tell  users  why  they  should  buy  or  use  what  the
company’s selling

Use  bold  graphics  such  as  snipes  or  bursts  on  the  landing  page  to
promote a mobile site.

to  encourage  mobile
Deploy  contests,  promos  and  sweepstakes 
downloads.  These  are  highly  valuable  in  the  online  space—both  for
users, who can redeem such offers immediately, and for startups, which
can test and adjust offers on the fly

Manage your content inventory. Content should build credibility for the
company,  presenting  it  as  solid,  established,  and  ready  to  do  business.
Information on most of the following should be accessible from the landing
page:

product detail and information about the solution

customer lists and success stories

customer resources and support

vendor partners

company background

current news and events

company contact information (postal, phone, and e-mail)

the company’s privacy policy

Look and Feel

Design  the  home  or  landing  page  for  maximum  impact  and  minimal
confusion.  Always  provide  the  user  with  multiple  pathways  to  the  desired
“activation”  action,  whether  it’s  subscribing,  posting,  playing  or  buying.
Strive for fewer, crisper design elements, not more, keeping national cultural
differences in mind when designing. (The advice below is for the U.S., where
users  expect  websites  to  look  clean  and  simple.)  In  some  other  countries,
including  China,  users  expect  more  design  elements,  which  may  look
cluttered to a Western eye.

Keep it clean and simple, without too many distractions from the call to
action

Pick one promotional message and drive it the hardest at the expense of
others. Make it more prominent, supported by other things on the page,
and  compelling,  along  the  lines  of  “free  trial  download”  or  “special
introductory pricing this month”

Leave  plenty  of  white  space.  Crowded  pages  are  clearly  a  turnoff.  An
overbearing  number  of  graphic  elements  (art,  type,  buttons,  etc.)  will
frustrate and distract users

Use visuals. Whether using graphics, videos, demos, or diagrams, don’t
rely on copy itself to maintain user interest. Web visitors have extremely
short  attention  spans.  Keep  the  diagrams,  charts  and  graphics  simple.
Use animation carefully to add interest

Use interactivity.  The  web  allows  customer  interaction  with  the  brand,
something no other medium allows. (If these kinds of tools aren’t on the
site, you’re not using the web to its fullest potential)

Use  big  buttons.  “Download”  or  “buy  now”  or  “sign  up”  should  be
graphically interesting, sizable and easy to spot

Navigation and Functionality

Navigation is really about two things: the logical organization of information
and the shortest routes to task completion.

“Friendly”  navigation  provides  users  several  “routes”  to  the  call  to
action.  Routes  might  take  a  user  to  a  demo,  to  customer  testimonials,  to  a
white paper, or to a list of product features. Since nobody can predict what a
customer wants to do next, each pathway should easily lead to “buy now” or
another call to action.

Confusing navigation is the “foe,” offering too many choices, confusing
buttons,  textlinks  and  a  hodgepodge  of  options  a  user  might  choose.  This
often leads to higher abandon rates.

Overall Website Functionality:

          •      Use  tools  to  invite  customer  engagement.  Video,  animation,  demos,
configurators  and  other  devices  should  provide  customers  multiple
ways to engage with the product itself, any way they’d like. “Take a
tour (of our product)” and “play now” and “forecast your retirement
needs”  are  typical  engagement  invitations,  and  each  is  far  more
powerful  than  offers  like  “read  more”  or  “learn  about...”  Some
examples:

                    1.  “Enter  your  age/answer  three  questions  to  learn  how  little  this

insurance costs”

          2. “Click here to see Facebook friends’ photos on our site”

          3. “Pick your character and start talking to him now”

          4. “Find young single women in your neighborhood right now”

          5. “What’s your favorite golf ball? Click here for deep discounts. Free

shipping!”

     •   Use a demo to engage users with the product and show off its features
and ease of use. Make the demo more compelling (and under a minute
long)  than  a  PowerPoint.  When  possible,  draw  users  into  an  actual,
functioning component of the product (“put your data here” or “play
this brief version.”). The demo should end at the call to action

Engage users with the product and show off its
features.

     •   Offer free trials. Not to be confused with a freemium pricing strategy, a
free  trial  offer  can  be  restricted  by  limiting  the  free  version’s
functionality or duration (as in “try it free for two weeks”). Follow up
with a series of e-mails that introduce features, offer tips, and provide
reasons  to  buy.  Where  it  makes  sense  financially,  follow  up  with
telesales

     •   Click to contact. Particularly for commerce and paid subscription sites
(and probably too costly for freemium or multi-sided startups), offer
several  ways  for  prospects  to  contact  the  company.  This  can  be  as
simple  as  a  clickable  link  that  spawns  an  e-mail  to  the  sales
department or a form for requesting more information or a call from
Sales.  Many  commerce  sites  use  real-time  live  voice  and  chat
technology to engage quickly with prospects and enhance the chances
of activation

     •   Use animation. Interactive configurators, calculators, animated demos,
microsites, and many other utilities can bring the product to life and
engage  the  customer.  These  can  be  developed  inexpensively  by
outside  sources  found  online.  Some  websites  launch  brief  welcome
videos or quiet, animated demos that load automatically when a user
gets  to  the  site,  but  only  play  on  demand  (so  it  doesn’t  annoy  the
visitor  or  drive  her  away).  Use  animation  sparingly,  as  it  can  be
jarring

     •   Incorporate source-driven pages: Create multiple landing pages and
match  each  one  to  the  source  of  the  click  that  brought  users  to  the
page. “Welcome, Yahoo friends” would almost certainly increase the
visitor’s comfort and click-through rate, as would a “special offer for
Yahoo  e-mail  customers”  that,  oddly  enough,  is  the  same  offer
presented to Gmail customers or on a slightly different landing page

An entire industry has emerged around tools to
encourage customers to take action.

Get Ready to Sell: Hire a Sales Closer

In  most  startups,  the  founding  team  is  typically  product-oriented  and  rarely
includes  a  sales  professional.  While  founders  often  do  just  fine  at  finding
earlyvangelist  customers  by  themselves,  they  often  lack  the  skill  or
experience to turn those relationships into orders. As sales efforts get under
way, it’s time to honestly determine whether someone on the founding team
has  the  necessary  experience  to  close  deals.  Does  the  team  know  how  to
negotiate with a buyer or a purchasing manager? Negotiate deal terms with a
CFO?  Are  the  founders  willing  to  bet  the  company  on  their  ability  to  close
the first sales? If not, it’s time to hire a sales closer.

A  sales  closer  is  not  a  sales  VP  who  wants  to  rush  out  to  build  and
manage  a  large  sales  organization.  Good  sales  closers  are  aggressive,  love
early markets, want great compensation for success, and have no interest in
building  a  sales  organization.  Typically,  closers  are  experienced  startup
salespeople noted not just for their rolodexes in the target market but also for
fabulous  listening,  pattern-recognition  and  collaboration  skills.  They  also
love finding new markets and closing deals and aren’t ready to retire behind a
desk.

While  the  closer  will  be  an  integral  part  of  customer  validation,  the
founders  and  the  CEO  still  need  to  actively  lead  the  process.  Together,  the
founders and the sales closer are the core of the Customer Development team.
It’s their job to learn and discover enough information to build the sales and
channel roadmaps. Going once around the customer validation loop without a
sales closer may make sense unless it holds back progress. At that point, hire
the closer. A closer is invaluable in setting up meetings, pushing for follow-
up  meetings,  and  closing  the  deal.  Having  a  sales  closer  is  in  no  way  a
substitute for getting founders personally out and in front of customers.

Get Ready to Sell: Sales Channel Roadmap

This  sales  channel  roadmap  section  assumes  that,  in  Customer  Discovery,
your  team  evaluated  the  distribution  channel  alternatives  and  is  focused  on
one specific sales channel. Get one channel right first, then expand later.

Rather than spreading yourself thin, focus on one
channel first.

What if you’re not sure this is the right channel? It’s OK, this is just a
test.  Rather  than  spreading  yourself  thin,  testing  multiple  distribution
channels at once, focus on one channel first, whether it’s direct sales, chain
stores,  or  mail  order.  Based  on  test  results,  other  channels  are  easily  added
later.  The  one  exception  to  this  rule:  companies  using  their  own  website  to
sell directly to end-users should also test that in parallel.

Elements of a sales channel roadmap are:

channel “food chain”

channel responsibility

channel discount and financials

channel management

Sales Channel “Food Chain”

 
For a distribution channel, the food chain is the link of organizations between
you and your customer (from your vp of sales to a sales rep to a distributor to
a retailer, for example). The food chain describes each of the organizations in
the chain, and its relationships with the company and with one another.

Here, for example, is the food chain showing how books move from a
publisher to a book-buying customer at an e-book publishing company. The
food chain diagram might look as simple as Figure 8.8 below.

Direct ebook Publishing Food Chain (Figure 8.8)

However, selling through the traditional physical distribution food chain

for printed books, it’s far more complex, as shown in Figure 8.10.

Book Publishing Physical Channel Food Chain (Figure 8.9)

To get ready to sell, create a visual representation of your channel food

chain. It may include these or other “links” in the chain:

National wholesalers: Stock, pick, pack, ship and collect, and then pay
the  publisher  for  orders  received.  They  fulfill  orders  but  don’t  create
demand

Distributors:  Use  their  own  sales  force  to  sell  to  bookstore  chains  and
independents.  The  distributor  makes  the  sale;  the  bookstore  actually
orders from the national wholesaler

Retailers: This is where the customer sees and can buy books

Review the channel hypothesis to see what needs to be included in your

diagram.

Channel Responsibility

A  channel-responsibility  map  diagrams  the  relationships  in  a  complex
distribution channel. A written description of these responsibilities, created in
describing  the  “food  chain,”  should  accompany  the  diagram.  It  helps
everyone on the team understand why the channel was selected and what to
expect from it.

One  of  the  mistakes  startups  often  make  is  assuming  their  channel
partners  invest  in  creating  customer  demand.  Most  do  not.  For  example,  in
Figure 8.10, don’t assume the book wholesaler does anything other than stock
and  ship  books.  The  same  is  true  for  the  distributor.  It  takes  orders  from
bookstores and in some cases may promote book sales to bookstores, but it
doesn’t bring customers into the store to buy. (Unfortunately nowadays most
publishers don’t create demand either.)

Channel Responsibility Map (Figure 8.10)

Channel Discounts and Financials

Each  tier  in  the  “food  chain”  costs  the  company  money,  since  each  tier
charges  for  its  services.  In  most  channels,  these  fees  are  calculated  as  a
percentage of the “list” or retail price consumers pay. To understand how the
money  flows  from  the  customer  to  company,  first  calculate  the  discounts
each channel tier requires. Continuing with our book-publishing example, we
can construct a diagram, as shown in Figure 8.11, detailing the discount each
tier requires.

Channel Discounts (Figure 8.11)

As  you  can  see,  a  book  retailing  for  $20  would  net  our  publishing
company  $7  after  everyone  in  the  channel  took  his  cut.  From  this  $7,  the
publisher must pay the author a royalty, market the book, pay for the printing
and  binding,  contribute  to  overhead,  and  realize  a  profit.  Out  of  the  $20  a
customer pays, there’s only a dollar or two for the author! No wonder authors
are ditching print and going directly to e-books.

Channel discounts are only the first step in examining how money flows
in  a  complex  distribution  channel.  For  example,  in  the  book  channel  and
many others (software, media, more), sales are on a consignment basis with
100 percent return rights. This means your product (the unsold books in the
example) can be returned to your company for full credit (and to add insult to
injury, you have to pay the return freight for returned products). Why is this a
problem?  A  mistake  that  startups  frequently  make  when  they  use  a
distribution  channel  is  to  record  the  sale  to  the  channel  (in  this  case  the
national wholesaler) as revenue. The sad truth is that orders from a channel
partner don’t mean that end customers bought the product; it only means they
hope and believe they will.

In addition, some channels have a stock rotation-returns policy (outdated
food,  old  versions  of  software  or  hardware)  requiring  allowances  for  a
proportion (or all) of your “sold” products to be returned.

Your  channel  financial  plan  should  include  a  description  of  all  the

financial relationships among tiers of the channel (see Figure 8.12).

Channel Financial Relationships (Figure 8.12)

Channel Management

Although  every  company’s  goal  is  a  well-managed  and  carefully  selected
sales  channel,  failure  to  select  the  right  channel  or  to  control  the  channel
often  results  in  miserable  sales  revenue  and  unanticipated  channel  costs.
Much  like  instrumenting  a  website,  you  need  to  monitor  your  channel
inventory  levels,  sell  in  and  sell  through.  In  a  direct-sales  channel,  it’s
straightforward: no goods leave your company until there’s a customer order.
In an indirect channel, however, the biggest risk is knowing how much end-
user  demand  actually  exists.  Why?  Your  company  has  a  direct  relationship
only with the tier of distribution closest to it. You’re dependent on channel-
partner  reports,  which  are  often  months  out  of  date,  to  learn  how  much
product  has  “sold  through”  the  channel  or  how  much  has  actually  been
purchased. Another risk is the temptation in an indirect channel to “stuff” the
channel. Stuffing means getting a tier of the channel to accept more product
on  consignment  than  sales  forecasts  reasonably  expect  the  channel  to  sell.

This tactic can provide a temporary but imaginary inflation of sales, followed
by  a  debacle  (or  in  the  case  of  public  companies,  lawsuits)  later.  All  these
potential  issues  need  to  be  documented  and  discussed  in  the  channel-
management plan in order to avoid surprises later.

Multi-Sided Markets

Multi-sided markets are more common in the web/mobile channels but exist
in  the  physical  channel  as  well.  Medical  devices  are  a  good  example  of  a
“physical” channel with a complex multi-sided market. An artificial hip may
be approved by the FDA, recommend by a doctor, implanted inside a patient,
bought  by  a  hospital,  installed  by  a  surgeon  but  paid  for  by  an  insurance
company. (See Figure 8.13 below.) In this case, just focusing on patients or
doctors or hospitals without understanding who the payers are and how they
reimburse  for  hip  implants  would  be  a  fatal  error.  Startups  in  multi-sided
markets need to validate all sides of their channel hypothesis.

Get Ready to Sell: Develop the Sales Roadmap

A classic startup flaw is hiring a sales force before you’ve figured out how to
sell. At the start, a fog of uncertainty hangs over you. It’s the founders’ job to
gather  enough  information  to  illuminate  how  to  proceed  one  step  at  a  time,
and then assemble that information into a coherent picture of the right path to
take. We call this the “sales roadmap.”

Your goal is to determine who your true customers are and how they’ll
buy  your  product.  You  build  a  sales  team  only  when  you  completely
understand the process that transforms a prospect into a purchaser and know
you  can  sell  the  product  at  a  price  that  supports  your  business  model.  With
the sales roadmap in their hands, the members of your sales force will be able
to  focus  on  actual  sales  instead  of  the  hit-and-miss  experimentation  you’ll
undertake as you move through the customer validation process.

With the sales roadmap in their hands, the
members of your sales force will be able to focus on
actual sales.

A  sales  roadmap  details  every  step  from  the  first  call  to  a  prospective
buyer to the contract signing. It should also show how those steps vary from
one  company,  buyer  or  job  title  to  the  next.  The  initial  sales-road-map
hypothesis  developed  in  customer  discovery  should  be  updated  based  on
customer  feedback  and  revisited  before  sales  calls  begin.  Don’t  worry—it
will change further based on field experience with customers.

The roadmap’s complexity depends on the customer’s size, buying cycle
and  budget  as  well  as  the  product’s  price,  the  industry,  and  the  distribution

 
channel selected. The roadmap for selling the CEO of a midsize company is
clearer,  say,  than  the  route  to  selling  a  Fortune  500  VP.  And  roadmaps  to
Safeway,  Intel  or  Toys  “R”  Us  are  far  tougher  than  those  leading  to  local
florists  or  pet  stores.  Good  roadmaps  are  hard  work,  but  they’re  the
difference  between  success  and  failure.  Refine  the  roadmap  while  the
company is lean and small, before dozens of sales reps find themselves lost
on the road, selling without a map.

Three  other  key  sales-planning  tools  support  the  sales  roadmap:

company organization and influence maps, and customer access maps.

Organization and Influence Maps

Remember  those  organization  and  influence  map  briefs  you  created  in  the
customer  discovery  step?  It’s  time  to  pull  them  off  the  wall  and  study  your
findings.  By  now  your  early  hypotheses  have  been  modified  to  reflect  the
reality  you  encountered  as  you  spoke  with  potential  customers.  Use  this
information  to  develop  a  working  model  of  the  purchase  process  for  your
target customer. You’ll also want to take a closer look at the notes from your
encounters  with  possible  earlyvangelists.  You  might  also  want  to  bring  in
customer information from other sources such as a company’s annual report,
Hoovers, Dun & Bradstreet or press articles.

The E.piphany sales cycle is a good example of how the influence map
for  a  complex  sale  can  be  developed.  Given  the  six-to  seven-figure  cost  of
E.piphany’s software, buyers had to feel a significant pain, recognize it as a
pain,  and  be  committed  to  making  the  pain  go  away  for  E.piphany  to  get  a
sale. The product also required “top down” selling to senior executives first
who would use their authority to mandate agreement/acquiescence from their
staffs.  In  a  large  enterprise  the  alternative  is  working  “bottom  to  top,”  up
from  low  level  employees,  with  each  trying  to  convince  the  boss,  a  much
more  difficult  process  for  costly  systems.  Further,  E.piphany  changed  the
status quo inside companies. It required several organizations to reconfigure
their  business  processes  and  job  specs.  While  an  improvement  for  the
company,  change  engenders  resistance,  and  resistance  creates  saboteurs—
always an unwelcome surprise.

The  bad  news:  multiple  “yes”  votes  were  required  to  get  an  E.piphany
order.  Other  enterprise  sales,  such  as  manufacturing-process  controls  or
customer support, sometimes need endorsement from only one key executive

or  user  community  to  close  a  deal.  With  those  packages,  Information
Technology executives personnel generally  had  input  into  selection,  but  the
actual users enjoyed substantial power in the decision. An E.piphany sale was
different,  since  IT  wasn’t  the  driver,  but  it  was an active participant—often
with veto power. Likewise, experience showed it was necessary to sell both
“high” and “wide” on the user and technical sides of an account. After getting
thrown  out  of  multiple  accounts,  we  built  a  simple  two-by-two  matrix  that
shows where support and approval were needed:

Support/Approval Matrix (Figure 8.14)

This  matrix  said  that  even  with  a  visionary  executive  in  an  operating
division  supporting  the  E.piphany  purchase,  it  was  necessary  to  sell  to  four
constituencies to close a deal. Without support in an operating division of the
company  and  IT/tech  “approval,”  we  couldn’t  close  a  deal.  Early  on,  it
became  apparent  that  if  the  IT  organization  was  determined  to  derail  an
E.piphany  sale,  it  would  often  succeed.  This  insight  was  a  big  deal.  It  was
one of the many “aha’s” that made Epiphany successful. We figured out how
to solve the problem because a founder and the sales closer were present to
witness  the  initial  sales  strategy  failure,  and  spent  time  figuring  out  how  to
pivot the sales strategy.

Early  sales  efforts  fell  short  because  they  ignored  the  fact  that  selling
E.piphany into the enterprise was different from the sale of other enterprise
products. The most glaring oversight was failure to enlist the support of the
IT organization. In sales calls, it was easier to get people on the operational
side  excited  than  it  was  to  excite  IT  about  a  suite  of  applications  to  serve
sales,  service  or  marketing.  In  some  cases,  E.piphany  took  the  excited
prospects in operating divisions at their word when they said they could make
CIO and the IT department “fall into line” and approve the purchase. In other
cases,  necessary  steps  were  skipped  and  it  was  assumed  that  several
enthusiastic users could do our deal. Rarely did this prove true.

Example of an Influence Map (Figure 8.15)

We  assembled  that  sales  failure  and  success  data  into  an  “influence
map.”  We  had  already  established  that  a)  we  needed  the  support  of  four
groups to get a deal done, b) IT would often be harder to win over than users
and  c)  low-level  IT  personnel  would  oppose  the  concept.  The  critical
question became “How to proceed?” The influence map, as shown in Figure
8.16, delineates the players and the order in which they need to be convinced
and  sold.  Each  step  leveraged  strengths  from  the  step  before,  using
momentum  created  by  groups  that  liked  the  company  and  the  products  to
overcome  objections  from  groups  that  didn’t.  More  often  than  not,
shortcutting the process or skipping a sales stage meant losing the sale.

When understood, the Influence Map set the execution strategy for sales.
Call on: (1) high-level operating executives (VPs, divisional GM’s, etc.) first.
Then,  use  that  relationship  as  an  introduction  to  (2)  high-level  technical
executives  (CIO  or  divisional  IT  exec),  then  (3)  meet  the  operational
organizations’  end  users  (the  people  who  will  use  the  product),  and  finally,
(4)  use  that  groundswell  of  support  to  present  to,  educate,  and  eliminate
objections from the corporate or divisional IT staff.

With  the  influences  understood  and  written  down,  turn  your  attention  to
answering the perennial sales question of how to get the proverbial foot in the
door.  For  corporate  sales,  purchasing  or  procurement  is  about  the  worst
possible  place  to  start,  particularly  when  offering  disruptive  innovation.
Varying  with  the  prospect’s  size,  corporate  sales  often  require  agile
maneuvering through different layers or departments to set up meetings with
the  people  identified  in  the  organization  and  influence  maps.  Sales  calls  to
actual customers help fill in blanks in the access map, adding information and
suggesting  behavior  patterns.  Figure  8.16  illustrates  an  access  map  in  a
corporate account.

For consumers, finding the right entry to early customers can be equally
difficult.  Rather  than  making  random  calls,  think  of  organizations  and
special-interest  groups  that  can  be  reached  inexpensively.  Can  you  reach
customers through organizations they belong to, such as the PTA, book clubs,
or antique car clubs? Are there web-based groups or meetups that might be
interested?

Example of an Access Map (Figure 8.16)

Sales Strategy

Understanding  the  influence  map  is  step  one  in  finding  a  repeatable  sales
process.

Lay out your corporate/consumer organization map, influence map and
your access map side by side. For a corporate sale, your challenge is to move
beyond the names and titles of the people you’ll call on to develop a strategy
for  approaching  them.  As  you  begin  to  develop  a  sales  strategy,  here  are
some questions to consider:

At what level do you enter the account? For example, do you sell high to
executives? Or low to the operational staff?

How many people on the organizational map need to say yes for a sale?

In what order do you need to call on these people? What’s the script for
each?

What step can derail the entire sale? Who are the potential saboteur?

Similarly,  if  you  were  trying  to  reach  twentysomethings  with  a  new

consumer product, the questions might be:

Do  you  need  to  get  access  to  a  specific  demographic  segment?  For
example, do you sell to college students? Parents? Families?

How  many  people  need  to  say,  Is  this  an  individual  sale  or  family
decision?

If this sale requires that multiple members of a family or group agree, in
what  order  do  you  need  to  call  on  these  people?  What’s  the  script  for
each?

What step can derail the entire sale?

Again, as you move out into the marketplace to sell your product, you’ll
learn  what  works  or  not.  As  predictable  patterns  emerge,  your  strategy  will
become clear.

Implementation Plan

A  common  first  time  founder  mistake  is  getting  a  “thumbs  up”  from  an
earlyevangelist and opening the Champagne to toast the first sale. As any of
you with experience in sales will know, don’t do it yet. Unfortunately, much
can happen between the time the decision-maker agrees to make a purchase
and you actually receive the check. The goal of the implementation plan is to
write  down  all  the  things  left  to  happen  before  the  sale  is  finalized  and  the
product delivered and to determine who will follow up to manage them. For
example:

Does the CFO or the CEO or both need to approve the sale?

Does the board need to approve the sale?

Does Mom or Dad need to approve the sale?

Does the customer need to get a loan to finance the sale?

Must other vendors systems/components be installed and working first?

Get Ready to Sell: Formalize the Advisory Board

Hopefully,  you’ve  asked  for  help  from  advisers  on  an  informal  basis  in
customer  discovery.  In  this  phase,  it’s  time  to  formally  engage  them.  There
are  no  hard  and  fast  rules  for  how  large  an  advisory  board  should  be  or
whether  it  should  be  a  “board”  at  all.  Basically,  you  want  two  things  from
advisors:  great  introductions  you  can’t  get  any  other  way  to  key  customers,
talent or investors; and bold, out-of-the-box business model design thinking
that  will  have  dramatic  impact  on  your  strategy.  All  the  rest  is  window
dressing.

Think  strategically,  not  tactically,  about  advisors’  reach  and  sphere  of
influence.  Recruit  only  advisors  who  will  make  a  serious  impact  on  the
company  in  one  way  or  another—think  quality,  not  quantity.  (If  you’re
raising  money  having  a  cloud  of  “impressive  names”  may  help,  but  don’t
confuse  them  with  these  people.)  Formal  advisory  board  meetings  aren’t
required,  at  least  for  now,  but  this  process  should  deliver  access  to  experts
who can help.

Begin  by  assembling  an  advisory  board  road  map,  much  like  the
collateral roadmap developed earlier. As shown in Table 8.5, the roadmap is
an  organized  list  of  the  key  advisors  needed.  (Don’t  feel  compelled  to  put
advisors in every box on the chart.)

In  this  example,  the  roadmap  differentiates  how  each  advisor  will  be
used (technical, business, customer, industry or marketing). Usually, the most
important  advisors  your  startup  can  have  are  the  ones  with  “golden
rolodexes”  who  can  make  high-level  introductions  to  early  customers,
channel partners, or partners who can deliver significant web traffic. Product
Development  may  need  technical  advisors  as  early  as  Phase  1  of  customer
discovery.  The  technical  advisory  board  is  staffed  with  advisors  from

academia or industry who can offer technical advice and pointers to technical
talent.  As  the  company  begins  to  sell  product,  these  advisors  are  used  as
technical references for customers.

Where  possible,  particularly  in  enterprise  sales  situations,  put  key
potential customers on the customer advisory board. These are people met in
customer  discovery  who  can  advise  about  the  product  from  the  customer’s
perspective. I always tell these advisors, “I want you on my advisory board so
I can learn how to build a product you’ll buy. We both fail if I can’t.” They’ll
serve as a customer conscience for the product, and later some will be great
references  for,  or  introducers  to,  other  customers.  Use  them  for  insight  and

to  ask 

Advisory Board Roles (Table 8.5)

Two  other  sets  of  advisors  to  consider:  an  industry  advisory  board  of
domain  experts  who  bring  credibility  to  the  company’s  specific  market  or
technology; and an advisor to the CEO who’s a “been there, done that” CEO
type who can bring practical, how-to advice.

Make sure that, for people that count to you, you
count to them.

The  number  of  advisors  for  each  domain  will  obviously  vary  with
circumstances, but there are some rules of thumb. Both sales and marketing
advisors tend to have large egos. You can usually only manage only one of
them at a time. Industry advisors like to think of themselves as the pundits for
particular industries. Have them give you their opinions without being in the
same room or showing up on the same day—this allows you to sort through
whose advice you want to follow. Business advisors are much like marketing
advisors,  but  some  have  expertise  in  different  stages  of  the  company.
Consider  keeping  a  few  on  hand  to  make  you  smarter.  Finally,  our  product
development team could never get enough of the technical advisors. They’d
come in and make us smarter about specific technical issues. The same was
true  for  the  customer  advisors.  Be  sure  to  learn  something  new  every  time
they come by.

Compensating Advisors

The  Oracle  of  Omaha,  Warren  Buffet,  says  it  best:  “Make  sure  that,  for
people that count to you, you count to them.” That about sums it up. Advisers
typically  receive  common  stock  without  precise  correlation  to  the  hours
they’ll  give  your  company  or  exactly  what  they’ll  do  to  help.  The  stock
typically vests over time, in monthly increments, so it’s easily adjusted based
on the adviser’s value to the company.

The best advisors of all pay you to become advisors.
They often make a modest cash investment.

 
The best advisors of all pay you to become advisors. They often make a
modest  cash  investment  of,  say,  $20,000  or  $100,000  for  some  of  the
company’s preferred stock, and their investment is “boosted” with a generous
allocation of common shares that pay for the advisory services. Sophisticated
investors recognize the importance of advisors’ willingness to not only lend
their names but also invest some personal cash in what they clearly believe is
a significant opportunity.

Customer Validation, Phase Two: Get Out
of the Building and Sell!

IN  THIS  PHASE  OF  CUSTOMER  VALIDATION,  it’s  time  to  try  to  sell.  Customer
discovery  had  you  get  out  of  the  building  twice,  first  to  understand
customers’ problems and how they work and second to determine how well
the new product solves that problem. And while you’ve no doubt conducted
hundreds of tests to iterate and pivot your business model, there is no better
“pass/fail”  test  than  asking  a  customer  to  give  you  an  order  or  spend  time
with your app or website.

In a physical channel, nothing validates a hypothesis better than a signed
order,  especially  when  it’s  signed  before  the  product  is  either  complete  or
actually  shipping.  In  the  web/mobile  channel,  the  equivalent  validation  is
attracting  users  or  payers  at  the  rate  your  hypotheses  said  you  would.  (In  a
multi-sided  market,  even  if  you’re  getting  great  traffic  and  growth,  be  sure
the “other” side, usually the advertisers or payers, are eager to spend to reach
your traffic.)

Your job in this phase is not to scale a revenue plan but to validate your
business  model  hypotheses  with  pass/fail  tests  that  feel  an  awful  lot  like
selling  or  building  web  traffic.  But  revenue  or  traffic  at  full  scale  doesn’t
happen until the next step, customer creation. Customer validation is the test
sales  process  that—while  it  makes  real  sales—is  principally  aimed  at
answering a long list of questions, including:

Are customers enthusiastic about the product’s value proposition?

Does the company understand its customer segments and their needs?

Do  customers  truly  value  the  product  features?  Are  any  key  features
missing?

Is the product pricing right, and can the product be sold at a reasonable

cost?

What’s  the  purchasing  and  approval  process  inside  a  customer’s
company?

Are  the  sales  roadmap  and  channel  strategy  valid  for  scaling  the  sales
team?

Are there enough customers to make this a real business?

“Get out of the building” means one thing for companies with physical
goods or those primarily using the physical channel, and it means something
radically  different  for  companies  in  the  web/mobile  channels.  Figure  9.1
shows the differences..

In customer validation, the testing process is a series of elegantly simple
pass/fail tests where the answer is binary, and never “it feels good” or “they
like it.” Some examples:

If your physical channel business model says...

you will close two sales for every 10 sales calls, do you?

an average customer will buy six widgets in three months, do they?

$5,000 at spent at a tradeshow (or in direct mail) will generate 25 leads,
does it?

2/3  of  the  prospects  you  pitch  will  refer  you  to  three  friends  each,  do
they?

Here are the next steps you’ll undertake, by channel:

Steps for “Get Out of the Building and Sell” by Channel (Figure 9.1)

Get Out of the Building: Find Earlyvangelists

The biggest sales challenge in customer validation is finding the right people
to  call  on.  This  involves  first  identifying  and  then  spending  time  with  true
visionary  customers,  not  mainstream  customers.  The  biggest  danger  is  that
not  all  visionary  customers  are  alike.  As  a  rule,  there  are  visionaries  with
budgets  (we  like  these)  and  “strategy,”  “long-term  planning”  or  “technical
visionary” people without the power to write checks. Table 9.1 describes the
differences.  We  shouldn’t  need  to  tell  entrepreneurs  this,  but  just  in  case:
focus  on  buyers  with  checkbooks.  They’re  called  earlyvangelists,  as  you
should know by now.

Earlyvangelists have budgets, period. And while all visionary customers
may recognize they have a problem, only the earlyvangelist candidate is (a)
motivated  enough  to  do  something  about  it,  (b)  perhaps  already  trying  a
home-grown solution and, most important, (c) has the clout and the budget to
solve  the  problem.  Often,  earlyvangelists  have  already  visualized  a  solution
something like the one being presented. They’re partners in this sales process
and  will  often  rationalize  or  explain  any  missing  features  to  their  own
management. Never ever embarrass or abandon them.

Review  the  key  earlyvangelist  characteristics  identified  in  customer
discovery.  Do  they  point  to  other,  additional  prospects?  Create  a  target
earlyvangelist list and repeat the appointment-generation techniques used in
customer  discovery:  generate  a  customer  list,  an  introductory  e-mail,  and  a
reference story/script. (For a refresher, return to customer discovery Phase 2.)
Even with thorough preparation, assume one of 20 prospects will engage in
the sales process. In other words, be prepared for 95 percent rejection! That’s
OK;  it’s  early  in  the  process  and  5  percent  will  do  just  fine.  Of  those  few,
depending on the economic climate, one of three or fewer will actually sign a
purchase  order.  That’s  a  lot  of  sales  calls  (which  defines  a  startup).  Good
news: A sales closer is aboard to handle all the tedium of making contact and

arranging meetings, which founders should always strive to attend.

Distinguish your earlyvangelist targets from other major customer types,
including  early  evaluators,  scalable  customers,  and  mainstream  customers.
Scalable customers may be earlyvangelists as well, but they tend to buy later.
Instead  of  buying  on  a  vision,  they  buy  for  practical  reasons.  These  will
become target customers in six months but are still more aggressive buyers of
new products than mainstream customers.

Finally, mainstream customers are waiting for the finished product and
generally need an off-the-shelf, no-risk solution. They might say, “We look
forward  to  testing  your  product  when  it  rolls  off  your  production  line.  We
don’t  test  prototypes.”  Remember  their  names,  since  they’ll  become
customers in one to two years.

Get Out of the Building and Test Sell

Buy a big briefcase and a pile of airplane tickets and kiss the family goodbye,
since this validation phase keeps founders on the road, “test-selling” until the
hypotheses  are  proved  with  real  orders  at  or  near  full  price.  It’s  time  to  get
face-to-face with more than a handful of earlyvangelists and try to get some
early orders.

Test Selling

Anyone can give away or deeply discount a product to get an order, but that
doesn’t  test  true  buying  intentions.  Earlyvangelists  see  the  advantage  of
getting  the  new  product  early,  ahead  of  competitors  or  envious  neighbors.
The earlyvangelist by definition should almost leap across the table and grab
someone  by  the  collar  to  get  early  access  to  the  product.  They  need  the
product  to  cure  a  severe  pain  or  secure  a  competitive  advantage  (and  over
time,  they’ll  help  make  the  product  better).  Customer  enthusiasm  is  best-
tested  when  the  product  is  sold  for  as  close  to  full  price  as  you  can  get.  In
fact,  you  want  to  label  access  to  the  product  as  the  “early  access  program”
and have customers fight to be a part of it. No interest? Then you’ve gotten
valuable feedback on how important the product is to people you’ve labeled
your most valuable customers.

Anyone can give away or deeply discount a product
to get an order.

There are two risks in calling on earlyvangelists. One is the request for

 
customization.  Visionary  customers  might  ask  for  unique  extensions  or
modifications  to  your  standard  product.  Sometimes  these  requests  are  good
news. If enough customers ask for the same set of “custom” features, they’re
not  custom  at  all,  since  customers  are  suggesting  the  “real”  product
requirements. The art of being a founder lies in knowing when to incorporate
those  requests  into  the  spec  and  declare  them  features.  The  danger  and
challenge is to avoid an inadvertent migration to a custom products business
where all the economics change at a disadvantage to the company.

The other earlyvangelist risk is the request for an “exclusive” or a “most
favored nations” clause. From the customer point of view, this is a reasonable
and rational request. “I’m going to take a risk on you, so I want a competitive
advantage  by  being  the  only  one  with  your  product”—an  exclusive.  Or,  “I
want the best pricing forever” for being first. Tread very carefully here. Often
these  are 
real-world
understanding  of  how  a  startup  works.  Don’t  give  up  your  rights  to  sell  to
other customers or you’ll end as a development arm of the first company that
asks you for an exclusive.

The Sales Process

Entrepreneurs,  hate  “process,”  but  some  basic  steps  are  critical  in  any
business-to-business  sale.  Here’s  a  primer  using  enterprise  software  as  the
model:

1.  Start  with  research:  Know  the  companies  and  the  individuals  you’re
calling on. Use market and web research to gather data. At a minimum,
you  should  be  able  to  draw  their  org  charts  and  understand  their
financial situations and latest information before making your first sales
presentation.

2.  First  meeting:  Use  the  first  meeting  to  understand  the  company’s
problems,  needs,  business  goals,  and  the  potential  “fit”  between  your
solution  and  their  problem.  Try  to  gain  a  sense  of  how  important  your
product might be to the company and how it would go about deploying
the product.

3.  Know where to “enter:  Get  “to  the  top”  as  quickly  as  you  can  but  not
too quickly. Meet one-on-one first with one or several midlevel people,

and then get in at a high level.

4.  Visualize  the  “before  and  after:”  Understand  how  the  company  solves
the  problem  today  and  how  your  product  would  better  solve  it.  Try  to
deter mine the return on investment, the ease of adoption and use, and
how it will save the company time and money.

5.  Customize your presentations: Do this as early as possible to reflect all

the learning above.

6.  Create  a  purchase  action  plan:  Get  the  buyer  visualizing  his  purchase
and use of the product by discussing the sequence of steps, putting dates
next to each, and talking about things like the launch date to help make
the purchase feel inevitable.

7.  Engage senior management at every opportunity: Introduce your senior
team  to  theirs;  wine  and  dine;  build  bonds  with  higher-ups  who  can
either approve or kill the deal.

8.  Present a custom proposal and get it signed: Need we say more (other
than “celebrate,” of course)? Provide attention and follow-through long
after the check clears.

Collect and Record Sales Findings

As  you’re  out  test-selling,  collect  and  collate  the  findings  consistently,
regardless  of  who  conducts  the  sales  call  and  whether  it  happens  in  a
Starbucks,  an  office,  or  a  conference  room.  If  more  than  one  of  you  is  out
trying  to  sell,  agree  on  the  key  set  of  facts  and  feedback  to  gather  on  each
call. Include objective metrics like “How many will you use?” or “How many
people  will  use  it?”  as  well  as  subjective  comments  like  “If  it  works,  I’ll
recommend it” or “I really like this product better than product X.” Develop a
consistent  sales-call  report  card,  similar  to  the  one  developed  in  customer
discovery,  to  record  responses  consistently.  End  every  report  card  by
answering four identical “buy” questions:

Is a purchase order in hand or on the way?

How many units (or dollars’ worth) will the customer purchase?

What’s needed to get a deal signed?

When might the deal be signed?

For  best  results,  record  detailed  notes  in  the  parking  lot,  after  the
meeting,  when  details  are  freshest.  Identify  follow-up  opportunities,  action
items, and other people to see either at the company or at others the prospect
may  have  mentioned.  Note  any  competitive  products  discussed.  Then  drive
on  to  the  next  test-sales  session.  Remember  to  send  a  thank-you  note
confirming details and next steps.

While  answers  other  than  a  purchase  order  are  rarely  binding  on  the
buyer,  you  should  get  a  good  sense  of  the  product’s  sales  potential.
Aggregate  the  numbers  to  create  a  “probability-adjusted  sales  forecast,”  a
“best  guess”  of  how  many  dollars  will  come  in  and  when.  In  the  customer
validation  step,  many  of  your  initial  visits  won’t  deliver  short-term  orders.
That doesn’t make the meetings unimportant. Remember, the primary goal is
customer feedback, not sales.

Without  a  doubt,  everyone  (including  your  board!)  will  focus  on  the
sales forecast. Try to uncover more about the value proposition, competitive
situation, pricing and, most important, whom to call on and in what order to
make a sale.

Understanding why customers said no is more
important than understanding why they said yes.
Understand where in the process turndowns
happen...

Create a spreadsheet summary for the data, making sure to allow plenty
of room for the comments, which are often most valuable of all. Weight the
comments and ratings based on the customer’s size or potential volume. Keep
very  close  tabs  on  win/loss  statistics  on  sales  calls.  Understanding  why
customers said no is more important in this step than understanding why they
said  yes.  Understand  where  in  the  process  turndowns  happen  (introduction,
product  presentation,  organizational 
issues,
technical issues, pricing) to help refine the sales roadmap.

issues,  not-invented-here 

The Pivot

 
As optimistic as a startup may be, the most likely outcome of the first sales
push is either no orders at all, or far fewer than you expected. Typically there
are two root causes:

The company hasn’t found earlyvangelists and needs to keep searching
in the current customer segment or abandon it and explore others

Other  parts  of  the  business  model  just  aren’t  compelling,  whether  it’s
product, features, benefits, price, issues, partners or several

Either  way,  you  need  to  stop  and  think  about  why  what  you  thought
would  happen  didn’t  happen.  This  test-selling  effort  is  still  a  learning
exercise. This is when you go back to your business model canvas and review
the hypotheses you assembled in discovery. If you can’t get early orders now,
clearly  some  were  wrong.  Did  you  pick  the  wrong  customer  segment?  Did
the value proposition not match this segment? Did the revenue model not fit
their budget? The business model canvas provides a visual way to diagnose
what went wrong and what you can change and test.

How Many Orders Do I Need to Prove Validation?

One of the first questions founders ask is, “So how many orders do I need to
validate my business model?” While we’d like to tell you the number is 7, it’s
more complicated than that.

You and your board of directors do need to agree
on a number.

If  you’re  selling  million-dollar  enterprise  software  packages,  three  to
five repeatable sales from the same customer segment may give you a good
indication that it’s time to scale a professional sales organization.

However,  if  you’re  selling  new  kitchenware  or  appliances  through  a
consumer  retail  channel,  you  won’t  know  if  you  have  it  right  until  the
channel puts in a reorder.

There’s no one magic number. But you and your board of directors do
need to agree on a number. You and your investors always need to be in sync
about what the criteria are for scaling and the cash burn rate resulting from

 
that decision.

Get Out of the Building: Refine the Sales Roadmap

You  developed  your  Sales  Roadmap  earlier  on  page  344.  In  this  section
you’ll continue to refine it. Only when a team follows the same path through
a  company  and  it  results  in  sales  over  and  over  again  does  the  road-map
hypothesis become fact.

Company and Consumer Organization

Startups  making  sales  calls  on  corporations  find  that  a  pattern  emerges.
Companies  don’t  have  hundreds  of  types  of  org  charts  but  tend  to  be
organized in one of four ways: by product in operating divisions; functionally
(engineering,  marketing,  sales,  etc.);  as  a  matrix  organization  by  both
function  and  product;  or  as  a  distributed  franchise.  This  makes  finding  the
repeatable path, and cracking the corporate sales roadmap much easier for an
entrepreneur. So first figure out which of the four types you’re calling on.

The  approach  is  different  for  consumer  products.  Consumers  may  be
organized  by  archetype,  demographics,  phychographics  or  “jobs  they  want
done.”  When  trying  to  reach  twentysomethings  with  a  new  product,  for
example, questions might include:

Is access to a specific demographic segment required? Should the focus
be college students? Parents? Families? Athletes?

How many people have to say yes to close a sale? Is this an individual or
family decision?

If this sale requires that multiple members of a family or group agree, is
there a logical or helpful sequence to use? What’s the script for each?

What steps can derail the entire sale?

Typical Influence Map in a Company Organized by Function
(Figure 9.2)

Using the Organization Chart to Build an Influence
Map

First,  get  a  copy  of  the  company’s  organization  chart.  If  you  can’t  get  one,
figure  it  out  by  talking  to  multiple  low-level  employees.  Then  map  the  org
chart  into  an  “influence  map,”  a  map  that  let  you  diagram  and  navigate
friends  and  foes  within  a  corporation.  An  influence  map  starts  with  the  org
chart.  Next,  locate  your  earlyvangelist  on  the  chart—the  person  whose
problem  your  product  solves.  Then  use  the  information  you’ve  gathered  in
multiple  sales  calls  to  figure  out  who  the  influencers,  recommenders,
saboteurs and economic buyers are (see Chapter 3). In the example in Figure
9.2,  the  company  is  organized  functionally.  CFO  Karen  Rogers  is  the

earlyvangelist.  It’s  her  decision  to  buy  your  early,  buggy  unfinished
enterprise financial software. Her two direct reports, Neil and Suzanne, will
influence her. But before Karen will buy, two in-house competitors must be
at  least  neutralized  if  not  won  over:  the  financial-modeling  and  tools-
development staffers in the sales and IT departments. In addition, their bosses
—the CIO and the sales VP—will weigh in before Karen can get her CEO to
sign off on the purchase.

Draw the influence map of each earlyvangelist you call on, looking for
common patterns. As repeatable patterns emerge, sales will come quicker and
easier.

Your customers will teach you how to sell to them.

Refine the Core Strategy

Earlier,  you  developed  Figure  8.3,  and  learned  that  you  needed  to  win  the
support  of  four  groups  to  get  a  deal  done.  Winning  a  high-level  executive
sponsor  and  buy-in  was  the  top  priority  (in  this  case  it  was  the  CFO  as  the
earlyvangelist with a budget), followed by using that enthusiasm to generate
support from the CIO. With those approvals in hand, next came support from
end users (who work for the CFO) and finally support from the IT staff who
work for the CIO.

Core Strategy (Figure 9.3)

Refine the Access Map

How do you get into a potential corporate account? Whom should you call on
first? The most senior executive? While entrepreneurs’ instinct is to get to the
most important and highest-level executives they can find, keep in mind that
you  usually  don’t  get  multiple  meetings  with  “C-level”  executives.  Practice
by calling on lower-level employees until you’re certain you understand you

have a product/ market fit.

After multiple sales calls on a variety of companies, your startup should
have learned which department or departments it should call on first to gain
interest and entry. Once inside the account, summarize the company’s needs,
assemble  a  sales  strategy,  present  a  solution,  and  work  to  sell  the  account.
Figure 9.4 is an example of an Access Strategy Map.

Key patterns to watch for:

Who should you call on first at a prospect to make a sale fastest?

Who else at the prospect needs to be called on, and in what sequence?

Who will need to approve the sale, and how long will the process take?

Who influences the decision, positively or negatively, and how do you
approach them?

Example of an Access Strategy Map (Figure 9.4)

Use  the  selling-strategy  map  to  answer  a  wide  range  of  questions,

including:

At  what  level  do  we  enter  the  account?  High-level  executives  or
operational staff?

How many people on the organizational map need to say yes in order to
make a sale?

Does each department perceive and care about the customer problem the
same way?

Which executives can influence or sabotage the sale?

In what order should people be called on? How do the scripts vary for
each?

How  much  purchasing  authority  does  each  level  you’re  dealing  with
have?  Are  they  authorized  to  sign  for  $1,000?  For  $100,000?  Do  they

Diagram  the  people  involved  in  a  business-to-business  sale  to  identify
the  buyer,  influencers,  in-house  competitors  and  issues  that  need  to  be
addressed  before  a  sale  is  made.  See  the  example  of  an  organizational  map
and a selling-strategy map below. Use the tools that make the most sense for
the situation.

Keep  refining  the  access  strategy  map  by  making  sales  calls  until  a
predictable, repeatable pattern emerges that will work equally well when the
company has 20 or 30 field salespeople instead of two or three. As the pattern
emerges,  the  selling  strategy  will,  too.  You’re  not  done  until  clear  common
threads  have  been  found.  If  there  aren’t  any  common  threads,  get  back  out
into  the  field  and  make  even  more  test-sales  calls  until  a  series  of  purchase
orders  and  patterns  emerge.  Keep  a  keen  eye  out  for  “danger”  patterns  that
may include:

testing or demo requirements before a sale is considered

formal  RFP,  bidding  processes  or  timetables  affecting  new-product
consideration

companies  requiring  that  all  initial  presentations  be  made  only  to  the
purchasing department

companies  that  refuse  to  buy  from  startups  (sometimes  the  case  in
enterprise software)

Example of a Sales Roadmap (Figure 9.5)

Develop a Sales Roadmap

The  ultimate  goal  of  this  exercise  is  to  develop  a  sales  roadmap.  This  is  a
detailed diagram of how to get repeatable orders that you, the founder, hand
to a professional sales VP. It’s the playbook for the repeatable, scalable sales
process. It details every step, every presentation, every e-mail and price, and
every  move  you’ve  learned  for  getting  an  order.  You  write  it  up  as  a  flow
chart  and  document  each  step.  Your  hiring  test  of  the  competence  of
prospective sales VPs will be whether they discard it and go back to their old
rolodex or if they use it and refine it.

It’s not sold until the check clears.

The selling process seldom ends when the visionary customer says, “Thumbs
up, I’ll buy.” Particularly in business-to-business sales (as well as sales where
husband  and  wife  must  agree),  much  can  happen  between  the  agreement  to

buy and the arrival of the check. Recognize and identify any steps required
before  the  sale  is  completed  and  the  product  is  delivered  and  paid  for.
Determine who follows up to manage the process.

For example:

Do the CFO and/or CEO need to approve?

Does the board or procurement group need to approve?

Does Mom or Dad need to weigh in?

Is there a budget cycle, lease or loan requirement in the cycle?

Must the company be an approved vendor?

Are  there  other  systems/components  from  other  vendors?  Or  other
dependencies like rewiring, adequate power supply, or a renovation that
have to happen first?

Get Out of the Building: Test Sell Channel Partners

If you sell through an indirect sales channel, now is the time to validate the
channel strategy you assembled in Phase 1. Validation means an order or at
least a firm commitment from prospective partners in your sales channel.

(Trying to get orders from channel partners earlier, without enthusiastic
end  users,  would  have  been  counterproductive.  The  typical  channel  partner
response:  “That  sounds  interesting,  but  will  there  be  any  demand  for  this
product? What do potential customers think?” What the prospective channel
partner was really asking: “Can I make money from this product? If so, how
much?” With actual sales and reports of enthusiasm from their customers, the
answers are far more credible.)

At  each  meeting,  try  to  learn  as  much  as  possible  about  the  potential

channel partner:

Will  the  channel  partner  buy  and  sell  the  product,  based  on  its  value
proposition, proposed pricing, and terms?

What  percentage  of  the  product’s  retail  price  will  the  channel  require?
Are there other costs such as freight, advertising, or promotion? What’s
the return policy?

Does  the  channel  partner  have  any  sense  of  potential  sales  volume?
Where and how will the partner promote or merchandise the product?

How  can  the  channel  be  influenced  to  sell  more:  bonuses,  training  for
salespeople,  sales  meetings  or  product  demonstrations,  a  golf
tournament? What means of encouraging more sales through the channel
are acceptable and affordable?

Will  the  channel  target  buy  and  sell  the  product,  based  on  its  value
proposition, proposed pricing, and terms?

What  percentage  of  the  product’s  retail  price  will  the  channel  require?
Are there other costs, such as freight, advertising, or promotion? What’s
the return policy?

Does the partner have any sense of potential sales volume? Where and
how will the partner promote or merchandise the product?

And the most important... does the channel partner create demand or just
fulfill it, when customers seek out the product.

Sometimes these discussions lead to an early channel stocking order. If
so, congratulations. Make it happen. The initial order may be a test market in
a few stores or a region, or a small quantity “to see how it sells.” Seize this
opportunity,  knowing  that  your  primary  mission  is  to  learn  as  much  as
possible about the channel, assuring everyone that when the product is ready,
it can actually get to market.

Identify the Channel Targets

Test  prospective  channel  partners  of  varying  sizes  and  types.  Just  like
listening  to  customers,  founders  should  lead  the  charge  in  each  channel  so
that they hear reactions firsthand.

Begin by making lists of the key people to see in each targeted channel,
including contact information and everything known about the target (drawn
from  customer  discovery  research).  Getting  that  first  appointment  with  a
national chain is a hard, low-percentage game, so prepare to be disappointed,
persistent, and tenacious.

Position the meetings as informational in nature, and be prepared to fly
halfway  across  the  country  for  20-minute  meetings  on  regular  basis.  (One
national  chain  buyer  is  known  to  turn  over  a  three-minute  egg  timer  at  the
start of sales pitches.)

Where  the  channel  involves  retailers,  validation  is  a  bit  tricky.  When
will the product be available in sufficient volume for the retailer to actually
buy  it?  Will  the  partner  agree  to  a  limited  test  market  sooner,  hoping  test-
market success leads to far larger, chain-wide orders?

Channel  validation  also  includes  meetings  with  independent  sales  reps
and  distributors.  Independent  reps  have  a  keen  sense  of  their  markets  and
usually  have  a  handful  of  key  retail  or  chain  customers  whose  buying
preferences  and  patterns  they  know  well,  largely  because  their  income
depends on it. Talk with these folks in multiple markets. Will the industry’s
No.  1  or  2  rep  firm  in  the  region  take  the  product  on  and  sell  it  once  it
becomes  available?  This  is  hardly  a  given,  since  reps  can  rarely  carry
competitive products. What’s the rep’s sense of his key customers’ potential
for  buying  and  marketing  the  product?  How  long  will  it  take  to  get
distribution,  and  what  kind  of  volume  might  the  startup  expect?  Meet  with
distributors to discuss the same issues.

A Channel Is Just a Grocery Shelf

One  caveat  in  channel  discussions:  never  confuse  channel  partners  with
customers.  Persuading  a  partner  to  carry  the  product,  or  a  big  system
integrator to work with your company, is decidedly not the same as getting a
customer to buy. While channel partners may place product orders, they order
only  when  customer  demand  pulls  the  product  through  their  channel.  End
users pay the bills; channel partners take your company seriously only when
you drive their revenue.

Never confuse channel partners with customers.

The  best  introduction  to  a  channel  partner  begins  with  “we  may  have
customers for you.” While this seems blindingly obvious, lots of startups fall
into the trap of thinking their sales problems are over once a channel partner
signs  up,  or  they  pop  the  Champagne  corks  when  the  first  “stocking”  order
arrives  from  an  indirect-channel  partner.  Wrong.  Think  of  all  indirect
channels  as  nothing  more  than  shelves  in  a  grocery  store.  Until  customers
become  familiar  with  the  brand,  they’ll  never  search  for  the  product.  Until
they  pick  it  up,  it  isn’t  sold.  And  just  like  retailers,  channel  partners  are
notoriously slow to pay their bills.

Keeping all this in mind, update the channel/service partner presentation
with information about early customer orders. Then hit the street and present
to  them.  The  goal  is  to  come  back  with  a  committed  relationship  (usually

 
evidenced  by  an  order).  Create  a  channel  sales-call  “report  card”  similar  to
the sales report card, and use it to estimate sales that might eventually come
from  the  channel.  At  this  stage,  channel-volume  estimates  will  be  difficult,
but you have to start somewhere!

Customer Validation, Phase Three: Develop
Product and Company Positioning

IN THIS PHASE OF CUSTOMER VALIDATION, you’ll use all the test results from
your  experiments  about  customers,  their  reactions  to  the  initial  value
proposition, and why they buy. The result is two positioning statements: one
for the company and one for the product. In this phase, you’ll:

develop product positioning

match product positioning to market type

develop a company positioning

make  presentations  to  analysts  and  industry  influencers  to  validate  the
positioning

Positioning is the attempt to control the public’s perception of a product
or service as it relates to competitive products. In Phase 1 of validation, you
crafted initial positioning for product and company, but formal positioning at
that  time  would  have  involved  too  much  guesswork.  Now,  with  50  or  250
thousands  of  online  customer
face-to-face  customer 
interactions under your belt, the company has real facts about why customers
buy and real customers to help further test and refine your positioning.

interviews  and 

Thus  far,  even  through  the  validation  stage,  spending  on  customer
acquisition  has  been  modest  and  the  risks  relatively  low.  But  now,  as  the
company  prepares  to  scale  from  dozens  or  hundreds  of  customers  to
thousands  or  even  millions,  it  needs  to  be  able  to  communicate  what  the
product is and does, and why the customer should buy or use it.

No PR Agency

Most  technology-driven  startups  believe  they  need  professional  “marketing
people” from a public relations agency to execute this positioning phase. In
reality, the first pass is best-done (and far more affordably) by the Customer
Development  team  with  feedback  from  Product  Development.  At  this
moment,  no  one  is  closer  to  the  customer  or  better  understands  what
problems customers say the product solves. No one else has struggled to learn
customers  needs,  get  an  order,  and  find  a  repeatable  sales  process.  The
Customer Development team is clearly best-qualified to develop a first pass
at describing what makes the company and the product unique. Later, during
customer  creation,  it’ll  be  time  to  bring  in  the  “experts”  and  their  monthly
retainers and invoices. By then you’ll be able to hand them facts explaining
why customers bought.

The Positioning Audit

Before the company spends time on positioning, it’s a good idea to air out the
conference  room  and  get  some  facts.  The  best  way  to  do  this  is  with  a
positioning audit. An audit is an unbiased way to learn how others perceive
your  company  and  products.  An  external  audit  interviews  a  representative
sample of people from a variety of categories, including customers who know
or have heard of your company and those who don’t; others who will carry
your message for you (industry analysts and influencers, bloggers, members
of  the  press,  and  others);  competitors  and  others  who  are  knowledgeable
about the industry or market.

Example of an External Audit Questionnaire (Figure 10.1)

Each  interview  asks  these  groups  a  series  of  questions  about  how  they
perceive  your  company  and  its  key  competitors:  Do  they  know  and  respect
your  product,  your  reputation,  and  your  leadership?  Do  they  think  your
company  is  a  credible,  trustworthy  provider  of  the  product  or  service  it’s
selling,  and  where  do  they  think  it  fits  in  the  competitive  set?  The  results
form a baseline of the perceptions others have about your company.

Form a baseline of the perceptions others have
about your company.

Once  you  understand  what  others  think  (usually  a  surprise  to  most
startups  breathing  the  rarefied  air  of  their  own  conference  rooms),  the
company can work on changing and shaping those opinions. An example of
an external audit questionnaire for customers, press, influencers, and analysts
is shown in Figure 10.1.

While  conducting  an  audit  is  the  kind  of  activity  pr  agencies  excel  at,
handing this function off completely is a serious mistake in a startup. Just as
your early sales calls were too important to be handled by salespeople, your
early audits are too important to be handed off to a pr agency. The members
of  the  founding  team  should  at  least  perform  the  first  five  or  ten  calls
themselves.

Listening  to  external  perceptions  of  the  company  is  half  of  this  audit
step. Listening inside the company is the other half. An internal audit directs
the same questions to the founding team executive staff and board members.
Most  startups  assume  they  have  complete  internal  unanimity  on  the  all  the
issues  in  the  external  audit.  An  internal  audit  will  probably  reveal  that  you
have a cacophony of voices (and you most definitely don’t want to be out of
sync with your investors.) The internal audit should unearth those differences
and extract new ideas. When the company has agreed on a final positioning at
the  end  of  this  phase,  you  communicate  those  ideas  back  to  the  entire
organization so it speaks with one voice.

Develop Positioning: Product Positioning

 
In  this  step  you’ll  put  a  stake  in  the  ground  and  formalize  the  product’s
positioning.  The  positioning  doesn’t  have  to  be  perfect,  since  it  will  be
refined  further  during  customer  creation.  The  result  of  this  product-
positioning  step  is  a  one-page  “product  positioning  brief”  that  updates  the
positioning  briefs  developed  earlier.  As  sales  literature  (data  sheets,  sales
presentations,  website  and  copy)  and  marketing  campaigns  are  created,  this
brief should be used to keep all the messages “on point.”

Feedback  from  customers  and  channel  partners  in  customer  discovery
and  customer  validation  has  continually  refined  or  affirmed  the  answer  to
what  your  positioning  is.  You  wrote  your  first  version  of  a  positioning
statement when you created the sales presentation, answering the question of
why  an  early  customer  should  buy  the  product.  Think  about  customers’
reaction  to  that  description.  Did  it  generate  excitement?  Was  it  credible?  If
customers couldn’t or didn’t explain why the product was interesting to them
—or  not—do  you  understand  why?  If  not,  re-contact  them  and  find  out  the
reasons. There’s no better input into product positioning than feedback from
folks who were exposed to the product itself.

The Product Positioning Brief

Return  to  the  simple,  single-phrase  positioning  statement  you  developed  at
the  outset  of  customer  validation  (remember  “Absolutely  positively
overnight”  from  FedEx?).  Did  it  resonate  with  the  customers  encountered
during  the  validation  process?  Did  they  find  think  it  explained  why  they
should  buy  the  product  or  what  it  did,  and  did  they  find  it  credible  and
effective? If not, back to the drawing board.

To refresh your memory, review product positioning example developed

in Chapter 8 (which may have been several months ago by now):

Example of Product Positioning (Figure 10.2)

A  thorough  positioning  effort  made  soon  after  customer-validation
interviews  will  often  save  the  company  time  and  money  at  the  start  of
customer  creation.  If  it  already  knows  how  to  position  the  new  product
against competition in a way that resonates with customers, it can hire a pr or
marketing communications agency and have it get right to work creating buzz
or  promotional  materials  or  both.  Neither  time  nor  dollars  are  wasted  on
ponderous, costly positioning studies and analyses. Instead, the agency is told
“here’s  the  positioning.  Run  with  it  unless  you  have  a  significantly  better
idea.”  The  agency  will  know  how  to  package  the  product,  the  pr  messages,
and  other  marketing  communications  tools  and  can  get  right  to  work
generating  results.  (Agencies  hate  this,  because  thinking  and  “strategizing”
are far more lucrative and less accountable activities.)

Develop Positioning: Match Positioning to Market
Type

Market type dramatically changes the messages your company wants to send
about itself and its products. So now it’s time to match the positioning to the
market type you’ve selected.

For an Existing Market

If you’re entering an existing market, company positioning is about creating
the  notion  that  your  company  is  both  different  and  credible.  And  solves  a
problem  that  customers  believe  is  important.  When  Apple  entered  the
smartphone market, people understood that the company was a manufacturer
of iPods but was now going to offer a phone and a web browser, too.

Once your company positioning is chosen, product positioning follows.
Since  in  an  existing  market  comparable  products  exist,  product  positioning
typically describes how and why your product is different along an existing
axis/basis of competition. Differentiation in an existing market can take one
of  three  forms:  you  can  describe  differences  in  product  attributes  (faster,
cheaper,  less  filling,  30  percent  more),  in  distribution  channel  (pizza  in  30
minutes, home delivery, see your nearest dealer, build it yourself on the web),
or  in  service  (five-year,  50,000-mile  automobile  warranty,  90-day  money-
back guarantee, lifetime warranty). Or it can take the form of how the product
fills a need or solves a problem the customer was searching for.

For a New Market

If  you’re  creating  a  new  market,  company  positioning  can’t  be  about  how

different your company is, since by definition there are no other companies to
compare it with in a new market. So in a new market, company positioning is
about communicating a vision of and passion for what could be. It answers
the  questions  “What’s  wrong  with  the  world  that  you  want  to  make  right?”
and  “What  is  it  that  your  company  is  trying  to  change?”  When  Airbnb
“peer-to-peer”
reinvented 
accommodations, they first had to communicate a radical idea: people would
want  to  rent  out  their  homes  to  strangers  who  would  want  to  stay  in  other
strangers’ homes.

breakfasts  with 

hotel/motel/bed 

and 

After positioning the company, positioning the product in a new market
becomes  pretty  simple.  Touting  a  new  product’s  features  is  unproductive,
since  there’s  no  context  for  understanding  them—no  comparable  products
exist—and customers have no idea what you’re talking about. If Airbnb had
positioned its service as “rooms for $89” or “sleep in a stranger’s bed” no one
would have had a clue what it was talking about. Instead, Airbnb positioning
talked about a “sharing economy” and emphasized the economic benefits for
both parties.

In a Clone Market

Cloning a business model from the U.S. that hasn’t made it to your country
(due  to  language,  cultural  or  legal  barriers)  is  a  viable  business  strategy.
Clones  are  typically  found  in  countries  such  as  China,  Russia,  Brazil,  India
and  Indonesia  that  are  large  enough  to  grow  companies  to  substantial  size
(greater than 100 million people).

Company positioning can’t be about how different your company is, as
there are no other companies in your country to compare it with, but you can
act as if you can predict the future. You know how the equivalent companies
are positioned in the U.S. Clone their positioning.

The  same  is  true  for  product  positioning.  Touting  a  new  product’s
features  is  unproductive  at  first,  as  there’s  no  immediate  context  for
understanding  the  features—no  comparable  products  exist—and  customers
have no idea what you’re talking about. But here again you can pretend to be
psychic. You know how the equivalent companies are positioned in the U.S.
As soon as the market is educated, clone their positioning.

For Re-Segmenting a Market

If you’re re-segmenting an existing market, company positioning depends on
market segmentation. Segmentation means you’ve picked a clear and distinct
spot in customers’ minds that’s unique and understandable. Most important,
concerns something they value and want and need now. Company positioning
for  this  market  type  communicates  your  deep  understanding  of  customer
problems/needs 
for  un-or  underserved  markets.  And  your  astute
understanding of how to uniquely solve it.

There are two types of market re-segmentation; a segmented niche and a
low-cost provider. Two examples of low-cost re-segmentation are Jetblue and
Southwest  Airlines.  Both  offer  cheap  fares  matched  by  minimal  frills,  they
entered  the  airline  business  low-cost  passenger  airlines  that  provide  high-
quality customer service on point-to-point routes.

There are two types of market re-segmentation; a
segmented niche and a low-cost provider.

The  rise  of  Walmart  was  another  example  of  an  entrepreneur’s
recognition that an existing market was ripe for a niche re-segmentation. In
the  1960s  and  ’70s,  Sears  and  Kmart  dominated  big-box  discount  retailing,
opening  large  stores  where  there  was  sufficient  population  to  sustain  them.
Smaller  communities  got  catalog  stores  (Sears)  or  were  simply  ignored
(Kmart). Sam Walton saw towns dismissed as “too small” as an opportunity.
“Small towns first” was his unique niche re-segmentation. Once established,
Walmart  proudly  positioned  itself  as  a  “discounter”—a  sobriquet  the  large
retailers  avoided  like  the  plague.  They  sold  name-brand  health  and  beauty
aids  at  cost.  This  strategy,  supported  by  heavy  advertising,  pulled  in
customers who then bought other products which, while priced low, carried
high  gross  margins.  Equally  important,  Walmart  adoption  of  cutting-edge
technology  to  track  how  people  shop  and  to  buy,  and  its  ability  to  deliver
goods  more  efficiently  and  cheaply  reduced  its  cost  of  sales  to  a  small
fraction of competitors’. By 2002, Kmart was bankrupt and Walmart was the
largest company in the world.

When you’re re-segmenting a market, product positioning is a hybrid of
market and existing market positionings. Since your segmentation has moved

 
your  product  into  a  space  adjacent  to  your  competitors,  product  positioning
describes how and why your new segment is different and important to your
customers.

Develop Positioning: Company Positioning

With  the  product  positioned  in  one  of  the  four  market  types,  articulate
company  positioning  the  same  way.  What’s  the  difference  between  product
positioning  and  company  positioning?  Product  positioning  focused  on  the
specific product attributes within a market type, while company positioning
answers the questions “What does this company do for me?” and “Why do I
want to do business with them?” and “Why does this company exist and how
is it different?”

Write the first version of a company positioning statement as simply as
possible,  always  keeping  customers  in  mind.  Describe  the  company  to
encourage  potential  customers  to  say,  “Tell  me  more.  It  sounds  like  you’re
solving a problem I have.”

Here’s a great but verbose example from Amazon.com: “We seek to be
Earth’s  most  customer-centric  company  for  three  primary  customer  sets:
consumer customers, seller customers, and developer customers.” UPS points
to  its  breadth:  “As  the  world’s  largest  package  delivery  company  and  a
leading  global  provider  of  specialized  transportation  and  logistics  services,
logistics,  supply  chain
UPS  continues 
management, and e-Commerce, ...combining the flows of goods, information,
and  funds.”  One  more,  from  the  simpler,  more  narrowly  focused  Zappos,
speaks  volumes  about  why  you’d  want  to  do  business  with  the  company:
“We’ve  aligned  the  entire  organization  around  one  mission:  to  provide  the
best  customer  service  possible.  Internally,  we  call 
this  our  WOW
philosophy.”  Notice,  that  company  positioning  is  not  about  product  or
features.

the  frontiers  of 

to  develop 

Sometimes,  founders  creating  a  new  market  are  tempted  to  name  the
new  market.  This  can  be  helpful  or,  more  often,  dangerous  and  expensive.
Generally  it’s  helpful  only  if  it  helps  explain  the  product’s  attributes,  with

terms  like  handheld  video  game  or  instant photography.  If  the  new  market
name  is  cute  or  esoteric,  prepare  to  spend  lots  of  money  explaining  the
market and why it’s important to customers, who need a frame of reference to
understand the company positioning. No-frills airlines and movies on demand
explain  markets  and  position  new  companies  within  them.  Tivo  spent
hundreds of millions convincing customers it wasn’t a digital VCR.

Table 10.2 illustrates company positioning by market type. Like product
positioning, company positioning doesn’t have to be perfect yet, since it will
be refined further during customer creation.

Company Positioning by Market Type (Table 10.2)

As  with  product  positioning,  the  result  of  this  exercise  should  be  a
“company  positioning  brief,”  brief  being  the  operative  word.  As  marketing
literature (press backgrounder, sales presentations, website) unfolds, this brief
will be used in conjunction with the product brief for consistency’s sake.

As  a  consistency  check  for  company  positioning,  revisit  the  mission
statement  written  during  customer  discovery.  How  did  customers  react  to  it
during validation interviews? Did they find that explained why the company
is different or special and encourage them to do business with the company?

In addition, compare the company’s description and mission statement with
those of its competitors. What are their company positionings, and is the new
company’s  positioning  distinct  or  differentiated,  particularly  as  buyers  are
concerned.  Is  it  simple?  Beware:  unsubstantiated  superlatives  like  easiest,
best and greatest are meaningless. Demonstrable, provable claims like fastest
and cheapest are stronger, although cheapest is a high-risk strategy as a rule,
since competition can quickly respond.

Unsubstantiated superlatives like easiest, best and
greatest are meaningless. Demonstrable, provable
claims like fastest and cheapest are stronger.

Develop Positioning: Validate Positioning

Industry  analysts  and  influencers  help  deliver  the  foundation  of  credibility
that  a  startup  needs.  What’s  an  industry  analyst?  In  the  technology  arena,
many firms charge customers to provide an “independent” and dispassionate
analysis of markets, trends, or specific products and their fit in those markets.
These firms vary in size and influence. In some technical markets (enterprise
software, for example) sales to large companies are very difficult until one of
the large analyst firms (Gartner, Forrester, Yankee) has blessed the product,
particularly  if  it’s  new.  In  the  entertainment  business  it  might  be  Kagan,  in
consumer products the NPD group.

Unlike  analysts,  industry  influencers  are  a  less  formal  category.  Every
industry  has  a  handful  of  pundits  who  publish  articles,  write  blogs  or  hold
conferences,  and  their  prominence  in  the  field  influences  what  gets  talked
about.  Sometimes  these  influentials  work  at  industry-leading  companies  but
speak  at  lots  of  conferences.  Other  influentials  include  writers  at  general,
business, or trade publications. Sometimes they teach at universities.

Test to see if they’ll sing your company song.

Identification of key analysts and industry influencers began in customer
discovery.  Meet  them  and  get  their  insights  and  feedback  on  the  initial
positioning  (market,  product,  and  company)  just  created  and  their  thoughts
about product features. Test to see if they’ll sing your company song (and if
not,  figure  out  why).  Even  though  early  adopters  will  be  evangelizing  the
product inside their company or to their friends and family, it helps to have
other “outsiders” who will say, “Yes, we’ve heard of them, and while it’s too
early to say how good their product is, we think their idea is quite valuable.”

 
It’s also important to line up industry analysts and influencers as references
for press interactions in the customer creation step.

All  this  would  have  been  difficult  without  real  customer  contacts,
feedback,  and  orders,  but  now  it’s  appropriate  to  contact  the  analysts  and
influencers  who  have  been  tracked  since  early  on  in  customer  discovery.
Hopefully,  their  names  were  recorded  in  a  database  after  the  company  met
them  at  conferences,  seminars,  and  trade  shows.  Before  any  meeting,  the
team  should  spend  time  understanding  their  opinions  on  the  market  and
product space (if not, don’t use the meetings in this phase to get up to speed;
do the homework first).

Before  contacting  analysts  and  influencers,  be  sure  to  understand  what
companies  and  industries  their  firms  cover  and  what  particular  area  or
companies the individual analysts cover. (There’s nothing worse than seeing
the wrong person or even the wrong company. It tells everyone that nobody
did  their  homework.)  Develop  a  short  script  explaining  why  they  should
meet.  Understand  what  they  cover  and  explain  why  the  new  company  will
shake up their market and why the product and company are important. With
this accomplished, the “what’s in it for them” is obvious; they won’t want to
miss an influential and important company. (They’ll almost certainly also try
to sell their consulting services, which at least theoretically have no bearing
on their opinion about the new client’s product.) Make sure to reference early
customers  and  the  problem/pain  points  that  the  product  solves  for  them.
When  they  agree  to  meet,  ask  how  much  time  they’ll  allocate,  what
presentation format they like (formal slides, demo, whiteboard talk, etc.) and
whether  the  presentation  should  focus  on  technology,  markets,  customers,
problems, or all the above.

Each analyst organization or influencer has a view
of the market or products it covers.

Assemble  the  presentation,  keeping  in  mind  this  isn’t  a  sales  pitch.
Focus  on  market  and  product  positioning  as  well  as  details  of  product
features. The objective is to validate the product and company positions and,
wherever  possible,  to  influence  analysts’  thinking,  not  to  sell  them.  Each
analyst  organization  or  influencer  has  a  view  of  the  market  or  products  it
covers—understand that view upfront (know it well enough to draw it on the

 
board).  If  creating  a  new  market,  get  the  slides  describing  its  view  of  the
adjacent markets it will affect.

Meeting an industry influencer may require the same formal preparation
as meeting an analyst, or it may be a lunch at a nearby pub. Do the homework
to  understand  how  the  influencers  acquire  and  disseminate  information
upfront, and adjust presentation length and style accordingly.

When  meeting  influencers  and  analysts,  remember  that  the  goal  is  to
gather feedback (and hope for wild enthusiasm). Also use the interaction to
gather intelligence about the marketplace. Make a mental checklist of critical
learning objectives. For example:

What other companies are doing anything similar?

How does the new company’s vision fit with market needs?

With customer needs?

How can the company best position its product, its place in the market,
and the company itself?

Is the product pricing right?

How does it compare with competitors’ pricing?

The  analysts  can  often  clarify  who  in  a  company  the  sale  should  be
made  to  and  the  kinds  of  obstacles  that  will  be  faced.  With  feedback  from
analysts and influencers as well several real customers, continue to the next
and final phase of customer validation.

Customer Validation, Phase Four: The
Toughest Question of All: Pivot or Proceed?

THIS  IS  THE  MOST  CRITICAL,  MOST  GUT-WRENCHING  phase  of  customer
validation:  honestly  determining  whether  there’s  a  scalable,  profitable
business  model  ahead.  Is  the  company  ready  to  go  forward  to  the  customer
creation step, when millions of dollars are often spent to fuel rapid customer
growth?  This  step  literally  “calls  the  question”  about  the  company’s  future
directions. It’s time to study all the test results, all the customer learning and
all the insights you’ve had from the facts you’ve gathered. Its time to see if
the company is ready to start spending money to scale, and that the result will
be a great, profitable company.

There are three steps to answering the crucial “pivot or proceed” question:

Assemble and review all key discovery and validation findings

Review  the  business  model  hypotheses  and  their  interactions  with  one
another

Focus on the “metrics that matter” in the financial model

Pivot or Proceed: Assemble Data Findings

By  this  point,  the  team  has  assembled  a  massive  amount  of  hard  data:

industry  research,  customer  segments,  customer  feedback,  marketing
program results, channel and cost input and much more. The data needs to be
verified, with any gaps, discrepancies, or anomalies filled in along the way. A
few examples:

The company needs 10,000 customers in order to be profitable, but the
market isn’t that large

Customer  acquisition  or  channel  costs  are  too  high,  rendering  the
company unprofitable

The  sales  roadmap  is  too  long  and  complex,  making  the  cost  of  sales
way too high

Despite best efforts, referrals just aren’t delivering additional customers

These anomalies are relatively easy to spot when all the data is collected
in  one  room.  They  often  call  for  further  customer,  channel,  or  product
development discussions. At times, they drive a business model pivot.

The best way to “translate” piles of data, is to make
it as visual as possible.

Build a War Room

The  best  way  to  “translate”  piles  of  data,  reports  and  questionnaires  is  to
make  it  as  visual  as  possible.  For  best  results,  lock  the  founding  team  in  a
room for a day or two to walk step by step through each hypothesis. Cover
one wall with a blown up “final” business model canvas. Cover the other wall
with the hypotheses themselves, sorted to keep the pieces of each hypothesis
together (remember, many hypotheses have multiple parts). Use another wall
for  supporting  diagrams,  and  allow  space  for  the  most  recent  canvas  and
perhaps one or two earlier iterations. Leave a large whiteboard available for
keeping score of questions and changes and for the key “metrics that matter”
numbers that emerge (discussed in detail in Step 3). While not every diagram
is appropriate for your startup, review:

 
a  work-flow  map  of  the  prototypical  customer  that  diagrams  how
customers do their jobs or live their lives both with and without the new
product

an  organizational/influence  map  showing  whom  consumers  or
businesspeople interact with, how often, and how those people influence
buying decisions.

customer archetypes: how they earn and spend their money and use their
time

a market map showing where your customers will come from

a channel or sales roadmap diagramming how sales will happen

a  fully  updated  business  model  canvas  (along  with  a  few  earlier
versions)

Review the Data

The most important hard data to review includes:

customer  feedback,  particularly  from  sales  report  cards  evaluating
customer enthusiasm for the product and its potential sales revenue over
time

market size and market share estimates

channel feedback and revenue potential summaries

pricing, customer acquisition costs, and any major product cost changes

detailed  information  about  the  industry,  the  customers,  and  their
behavior

competitive product and pricing information

The  team,  often  including  investors,  should  review  all  the  materials  to
ensure that all the learning from discovery and validation has been integrated
into  the  latest  versions  of  the  hypothesis  documents  and  into  an  updated
version of the business model canvas that will be discussed in the next step.
The key activity at this stage is to look at the intersections of, or interactions

among,  the  business  model  components,  since  no  doubt  many  components
have  changed  along  the  way.  The  process  is  a  healthy  one,  and  the  results
fuel the next steps of the pivot-or-proceed process.

Look at the intersections of, or interactions among
the business model components.

The  Business  Model  Checklist  (Figure  11.2)  gives  you  and  your
management  team  the  questions  you  should  be  asking  and  worrying  about.
Print  them  out.  Keep  them  handy.  And  worry  “Am  I  going  to  bet  my
company that I got them right?”

Pivot or Proceed: Validate Your Business Model

It’s  been  a  long  road  but  you’ve  converted  most  of  your  business  model
hypotheses from customer discovery into facts. You’ve done so by extensive
testing  through  face-to-face  customer  interactions.  So,  if  the  customer-
relationships  hypothesis  said  one  of  every  five  acquired  customers  will
activate and pay for the service or app, this actually happened in validation,
with  hundreds  if  not  thousands  of  customers.  Or  you’ve  proven  that  people
return to the product or app three times a week for an average of 20 minutes
per visit or spend $100 a month visiting once.

Review Business Model Hypotheses (Figure 11.1)

The  team  should  assemble  data  collected  in  the  last  phase  in  its  “war
room” use the checklist to walk through the business model hypotheses, box
by  box,  and  ascertain  that  there  are  factual,  definitive  answers  to  at  least
every question on the checklist.

In  this  final  phase  of  customer  validation  the  company  asks  itself  the
same questions it asked in Phase 4 of customer discovery. But at this point, it
should have much more quantitative, irrefutable proof of the answers, since
you’ve spoken to far more customers and conducted many more tests.

The Business Model Canvas as a Scorecard

Hopefully  you’ve  been  taking  regular  snapshots  of  your  business  model
canvas  –  either  week-by-week  snapshots,  or  at  least  at  each  major  pivot.  If
you’ve  done  it  this  way  you  now  essentially  have  a  film  strip  of  the
entrepreneurial process.

As you can see from Figure 11.1, each stage of discovery and validation
refined  the  canvas.  Experiments  were  run,  learning  caused  iterations  and  a
few pivots, and all were documented in a new canvas (reread this section for
tips).

Now that you have your canvases up on the wall use them as a point of

discussion.

The answers to “Is this a business?” can be found in
the results of the multitude of tests you’ve
conducted throughout the validation process.

The  answers  to  “Is  this  a  business?”  can  be  found  in  the  results  of  the
multitude of tests you’ve conducted throughout the validation process. As is
often the case, when the results aren’t convincing enough, or when they don’t
deliver the traffic or financial targets of the business model, it’s time to iterate
or pivot, and retest to see if the new approach improves the results. After all,
the company will very shortly be spending millions of dollars in the customer
creation  phase,  where  results  are  expected  to  be  far  more  predictable,  and

 
much more is at risk. While this may seem ambitious and unreasonable, the
closer  a  company  is  to  this  “fact-based  plan,”  the  greater  its  chances  for
business and fund-raising success.

This step answers one key question: do all the tests point to a scalable, sizable
business? And can it happen before the company runs out of money?

In  this  step,  you’ll  figure  out  whether  you  have  a  potentially  thriving

business, a hobby, or a tax loss.

Answering the question doesn’t require pounds of Excel spreadsheets or
50-item budgets. It relies more on the facts you’ve developed by testing your
original  hypotheses  with  the  only  people  who  have  the  answers,  your
customers, and with a short list of numbers, the metrics that matter.

A mere handful of numbers define the difference
between a scalable, profitable business and a
failure.

A  mere  handful  of  numbers  define  the  difference  between  a  scalable,
profitable  business  and  a  failure.  Successful  entrepreneurs  will  be  able  to
recite,  adjust,  and  recompute  this  handful  or  so  of  key  numbers  about
customers, product costs, and revenue growth while they sleep. Meanwhile,
they’re  always  focused  on  the  two  metrics  that  matter  most:  how  many
months’  worth  of  cash  remain  in  the  bank?  And  how  fast  are  we  burning
through what’s left?

We guarantee that this different approach to finance will get you thrown
out  of  just  about  every  business  school  in  the  country,  but  it’s  all  that’s
needed  at  this  stage  to  determine  whether  your  business  model  passes  the
validation test and is ready to move on from validation to scale in customer
creation.

 
Metrics that Matter

Since  page  1  of  this  book  you’ve  been  using  the  business  model  canvas  to
organize  your  testing.  In  this  section  we’re  going  to  use  the  canvas  to
organize  your  financial  model.  This  is  a  radically  different  approach
compared to more typical use of 5-year revenue forecast spreadsheets. Think
of  it  as  bringing  your  “report  card”  home  to  Mom  and  Dad—hopefully,  a
report  card  full  of  A’s  and  A+’s,  since  B  and  C  responses  do  not  a  great
company  make.  Some  elements  of  the  business  model  represent  revenue  or
costs, while others fuel growth. Physical and web/mobile channel costs vary
widely,  as  do  rates  of  sale  and  growth,  so  one  last  time  we’ll  examine  the
metrics three different ways:

In a physical channel, less than a dozen numbers usually tell the entire story:

Value proposition: What are product cost, market size, attainable market
share, and customer impact of network effects?

Customer Relationships: What are customer acquisition costs, prospect
conversion rates, customer lifetime value, and customer switching costs
that the company may have to pay?

Market  Type:  As  discussed  in  Chapter  1,  different  market  types  drive
different revenue curves to consider in longer-term revenue predictions

Cost Structure: What are the basic operating costs of the business?

Channel:  What  are  the  costs  of  selling  through  the  channel?  Channel
margin, promotion, shelf-space charges?

Revenue Streams:  What  are  the  average  selling  price,  total  achievable
revenue, and number of customers a year?

Burn Rate  (derived  from  the  above):  How  much  cash  is  the  company
“burning” (spending) a month? When will the company run out of cash?
There’s no precise formula for what a burn rate should be, but since it’s
the issue over which boards most often fire their founders, the founders
and investors must agree on what the burn rate should be and how many
more  pivots  the  startup  can  afford  in  its  search  for  the  scalable,
profitable business model

Assemble all your test results to provide a forecast for the coming year,
which begins on Day One of Step 3 of Customer Development, the customer
creation process.

We  doubt  there  have  been  many  startups  where  the  year-one  financial
results of customer creation matched the “metrics that matter.” But any VC,
uncle or rich neighbor is going to want to know why you think an investment
in your startup will deliver startup-size returns. If at the end of this step the
numbers  are  ugly—yup,  you  guessed  it—turn  back  to  the  beginning  of
discovery,  or  at  least  customer  validation,  and  start  revising  and  retesting
your hypotheses.

Three things to consider before you dive into Metrics That Matter:

Use  the  time  frames  that  make  the  most  sense  for  your  startup.
Generally,  the  longer  the  physical-channel  sales  cycle  (think  enterprise
software), the longer the “space” between calculations should be. Here
we used a quarter-by-quarter forecast

An analysis like this can—and should—often stop the pivot–or-proceed
process in its tracks if the computation forecasts that the company will
either run out of money within the year or won’t be able to raise enough
funds to survive the first year of customer creation

Don’t be in a hurry at this critical step. As an entrepreneur, if you take a
pile of money to move forward here and fail, it will at least cost you a
significant  portion  of  your  founders’  equity,  and  it  will  often  cost  you
your job

Metrics that Matter Scenarios

Metrics  matters  are  a  radically  new  approach  to  startup  math.  They’re  best
illustrated  by  example.  The  spreadsheet  scenario  on  the  following  pages
illustrates how you can use “Metrics that Matter” to evaluate your business if
you are selling a physical product in a physical channel.

Metrics that Matter: Example

“EZ Gardener” in a Physical Channel

Let’s  take  a  look  at  Table  11.1  what  the  metrics  that  matter  for  a

physical channel would look like in spreadsheet form.

Here’s  a  simple  example  of  a  rough  quarter-by-quarter  cash-burn
computation  for  our  hypothetical  $30  (suggested  retail)  EZ  Gardener  all-in-
one  gardening-tool  set,  sold  in  garden  stores  and  by  mass  merchants.  Our
timing is the coming year. (The spreadsheet starts Day One of the customer
creation process.)

“Metrics That Matter”: Physical Channel Model (Table 11.1)
Note: the leftmost numbers refer to commentary in descriptive text that
follows.

A  few  things  about  the  hypothetical  business  factored  into  the  numbers

above:

This “friends and family” funded venture begins customer creation with
$500,000  in  the  bank.  Like  most  physical-channel  marketers,  EZ
Gardener  also  promotes  online.  But  they  read  this  book,  followed
directions,  and  are  “getting  the  most  important  channel  right  first,”  so
they’re not selling product online yet

In year two, as the product’s newness wears off, the price drops.

Product  development  was  completed  earlier  offshore,  so  there  are  no
more development costs until we see how this product sells

Revenue  never  scales  dramatically,  since  the  market  type  is  “re-
segmenting/niche market”

What Metrics Matter?

There are 11 metrics that matter in this spreadsheet. Following the left-hand
column of the spreadsheet, let’s explore the origin of each number as well as
its source a little more closely:

1.   Total number of units sold: This number is estimated (ideally by

quarter) from customer validation report cards used with buyers and
channel partners. Compare these numbers with your estimates of total
addressable (or if known, serviceable) market and your market share
estimates. Use the two sets of numbers to estimate the number of units to
be sold in each quarter. If customers make multiple purchases within a
year, factor it in.

2.   Average retail selling price: How much the consumer will pay, on

average, for the product. This number, developed in the value proposition
hypothesis, should be validated in the competitive analysis and
throughout customer and channel validation conversations. It’s shown
here as the price per unit and is often the average selling price, since retail
pricing may vary by channel.

3.   Gross sales across all channels: Total retail-dollar sales for the product
per quarter. Relatively straightforward to compute, since the company is

using only one sales channel. Remember to consider “guaranteed sale”
situations where retailers can return unsold merchandise for full credit.

4.   (Less) channel discount (40%): What percentage of the product’s retail
price will the channel take as its cost of sales? Deduct it from the retail
price and apply it to all channel revenue as computed in No. 3. We’ve
assumed a fairly typical chain-store margin here. This revenue will never
reach the company’s coffers, so deduct it now to get to net company
revenue.

Channels are notorious for charging suppliers for
advertising, promotion, and shelf space.

5.   (Less) other channel costs: Channels are notorious for charging

suppliers for advertising, promotion, and even shelf space. There may
also be costs of independent sales reps or brokers who “sell in”
merchandise to the channel. In the first year, the company may want to,
or be forced to, purchase special promotions in order to get shelf space in
an important retail channel. Estimate these costs based on channel-partner
discussions.

6.   NET COMPANY REVENUE: The net channel revenue (No. 6) is the

Gross Sales (No. 3) minus the channel discount (No. 4) and other channel
cost (No.5).

7.   (Less) sales costs (reps, trade shows): How much does it cost the team

to reach the garden product channel cost? In addition to specific customer
acquisition costs, the company will spend money on a sales force, sales
and marketing materials, attendance at trade shows and more. These costs
should be identified in the customer-relationships box and perhaps also in
the cost structure box.

8.   (Less) product costs: What does it cost to build and make the product?

Developed primarily from the value proposition and cost structure boxes,
this is an estimate combining two sets of costs:

 
     •   in this example the cost of developing the product is fully paid for

     •   the manufacturing cost of the physical product itself

9.   (Less) current operating costs: Compute the costs of “turning on the
lights” at the company every day, which should be a relatively static
number: meager founder salaries, other payroll, rent, equipment, utilities,
legal, and the like. This number usually shifts the least, so worry about it
less than others. The spreadsheet increases it modestly late in the year and
in the second year, as is typical.

10.  CASH BURN FOR PERIOD: Did we make or lose money this quarter?
How much? Start with the net company revenue (No. 6) and subtract all
the costs beneath it, Nos. 7, 8, and 9. The result of that equation is the
“cash burn,” or the reduction in the company’s bank account each quarter.
In the example above, the company is losing money, or “burning cash,”
until the fourth quarter, when customer growth and reduced product-
development costs improve the company’s cash flow quite dramatically.

11.  CASH REMAINING: Start by counting the money in the bank on Day
One of the quarter. Our hypothetical company began its first year of
customer creation with $500,000 in the bank. Reduce it by the quarter’s
cash burn to determine how much will be left at quarter’s end.

If These Were Your Numbers, What’s a Founder to
Do?

This is a “nice little business,” and while it will make a lovely living for its
founders and a nice return for its investors, it’s hardly a scalable business like
the many heroes of Silicon Valley. But even though this company is returning
as much pretax profit in year two as it had in the bank on day one of year one,
it’s  basically  going  nowhere  fast.  It’s  a  one-product  company,  and  the  only
way  it  got  strong  revenue  growth  was  by  reducing  its  retail  price—never  a
good sign.

Some things the founders and board should really be discussing:

Are there any potential dramatic changes to the business model that can
have significant impact on the company’s future growth prospects?

What about overseas markets? Are they a growth opportunity?

How  can  the  company  capitalize  on  its  one  modest  success.  Are  they
building a brand enough, and creative enough, to perhaps launch other
products  both  in  and  beyond  the  garden  area.  They  might  start  with
“EZWeeder”  and  “EZhoe”  first,  and  perhaps  expand  to  “EZgrass”  or
“EZflowers” to take maximum advantage of their brand, credibility and
channel relationships to scale the company broader and faster?

Can  they  extend  beyond  the  garden,  maybe  adding  “EZcooker”  or
“EZcleaner” or “EZcleanup” perhaps? Regardless of the new products,
the  company  would  need  to  spend  some  serious  product  development
dollars and spend heavily on marketing (especially if moving beyond the
garden)  with  no  assurances  of  further  success.  (They  actually  need  to
develop a whole new set of hypotheses)

Unless the company invests in new product development, this business
is more of a hobby than a scalable business

Hold these thoughts—and others—for the final section of this phase, the
pivot-or-proceed  discussion.  Next,  look  at  the  second  of  three  business
models for a software product sold in the web and mobile channels.

Some Final Thoughts About the Financial Model

Market Type Affects Revenue Streams. Each of the four market types has a
distinctive sales-growth curve shaped by the degree of difficulty involved in
transitioning  from  sales  to  the  earlyvangelists  to  sales  to  mainstream
customers. Obviously in new markets, it typically takes considerable time for
the  product  to  catch  on  beyond  earlyvangelists,  who  aren’t  typically  high-
volume mainstream buyers. So success with early sales doesn’t guarantee fast
revenue scaling.

The  sales-growth  curves  for  a  new  market  and  an  existing  market
graphically  illustrate  the  difference.  Even  after  finding  and  successfully
selling to earlyvangelists, the rate of sales differs in later years because of the
different adoption rates of mainstream customers.

Revenue Growth in New and Existing Markets (Figure 11.3)

Estimating  revenue  in  an  existing  market  is  relatively  simple:  Look  at
the  incumbents  and  calculate  the  increasing  percentage  of  market  share  the
startup will grab each year.

Estimating a new market’s size might seem impossible, since it doesn’t
exist yet. What to do? Estimate the opportunity based on proxies and adjacent
markets.  See  if  there  are  any  comparable  companies.  Have  others  grown  as
fast as the estimate? Why will this startup perform similarly?

Revenue Growth in a Resegmented Market (Figure 11.4)

The  sales  curve  in  a  re-segmented  market  is  somewhat  easier  to
estimate. It’s generally similar to that of a new market in that it takes time to
gather  a  head  of  steam.  There  are  three  steps  to  assessing  a  re-segmented
market:  assess  the  size  of  the  existing  market,  figure  out  how  large  your
startup’s “segment” is, and calculate the adoption rate, or the time it will take
for  that  segment  to  recognize  the  new  product  as  the  solution  of  choice.
Count only the segment that will switch, and beware of long-term contracts,
service  contracts,  and  “sunk  costs”  such  as  training  and  installation,  all  of
which are often “lock-ins” or hidden barriers to switching.

Revenue growth curves depend on Market Type!

Demand Curve Affects Revenue: The “demand curve” seeks the optimum
intersection between sales volume and net profit. For example, if a physical
product  is  most  efficiently  manufactured  in  lot  sizes  of  5,000,  can  that
inventory  be  sold  in  a  reasonable  time  when  current  unit  sales  are  50  a
month? A startup selling new electric cars for $29,000 will generate massive
demand.  But  if  they  cost  $45,000  to  manufacture,  the  company  will  go
bankrupt very quickly. Consider:

the actual price per unit, for multiples, and for subscriptions

how pricing can be used to attract more users

how  pricing  can  create  larger  or  more  frequent  purchases  by  the  same
user; volume discounts, free shipping, loyalty points and similar pricing
mechanisms  are  used  for  what’s  typically  called  “market  basket”
optimization

how pricing can be used to enhance profitability or volume

how  the  company  can  forward-price  the  product  to  intersect  the
economies-of-scale curve (as in, “If we could build 10,000 at a time, our
production cost drops 32 percent”)

When to Bring in the Accountants

Eventually,  prospective  investors,  banks,  and  others  will  want  to  see  the
traditional  P&L,  forecast,  and  more,  and  that’s  fine.  Once  the  metrics  that

 
matter are firmly understood to make sound business sense and are validated,
almost any finance type (or high school math student) can convert them into a
VC-ready multiyear P&L spreadsheet, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement
(the “usual stuff” everyone is accustomed to seeing) with ease.

On  rare  and  welcome  occasions,  metrics  that  matter  actually  don’t
matter  at  all.  If  customer  acquisition  and  activation  are  proceeding  at  warp
speed month after month or the economy is hot, investors may ignore most of
the other metrics, throw caution to the wind, and vote to scale the company
rapidly. This seldom happens, but we hope it happens to you. It can happen
more often in frothy vertical markets, as it did in social networking and other
multi-sided  markets  or  strong  IPO  markets,.  But  nine  times  out  of  10,  the
metrics that matter do matter quite a bit when it comes time to spend serious
investor dollars.

Adding it all up

This phase is a vital make-or-break analysis of how well the business model
should work. But remember that the numbers are still only educated guesses,
validated—we  hope—through  extensive  customer  discovery  and  validation
effort with scores if not hundreds of customers.

Pivot or Proceed: Re-Validate the Business Model

It’s  the  perfect  time  to  take  one  last  look  at  the  key  business  model
components, for several reasons. In a few days, a great deal will change if the
vote  is  “go  forward”  to  the  customer  creation  step.  Customer  creation  is  a
radically  different  stage  during  which  the  company  suddenly  shifts  from
“searching  for  a  business  model”  to  “executing  one.”  It’s  no  longer
celebrating  mistakes  and  wrong  turns.  It  shifts  full-throttle  into  “execute”
mode, with revenue targets and timetables to hit, product and plans to deliver,
and  more  granular  and  precise  accountability  to  investors  and  board
members.

The  company  is  about  to  spend  a  great  deal  of  money  far  faster,  and
irrevocably,  as  it  works  ambitiously  to  deliver  its  chosen  business  model.
With that comes the typical “career risk” for founders, which always prompts
investors to ask if the seemingly manic “founder type” should be replaced by
a “seasoned” leader with proven execution skills. Massive amounts of money
are  about  to  be  spent  on  a  single,  focused  bet  that  the  business  model,  as
developed, has a high likelihood of scaling to profit and success. Boards and
investors  are  suddenly  less  forgiving  and  typically  far  less  welcoming  of
reports like “That idea was wrong” and “That didn’t work as we hoped” than
they were during the earlier “search” phases.

Long  story  short,  it’s  time  to  revisit  the  core  business  model  elements

one last time.

Best Bets

You’re almost done. You’ve run the numbers in the last section and are still
feeling  like  your  business  is  a  winner.  But  have  you  picked  the  best  value
proposition?  Is  your  product  delivery  schedule  right?  Are  you  confident

you’ve gotten the optimum revenue model and costs? And have you missed
any best moves on the overall business model? Here are a few last things to
check.

Make Sure the Value Proposition is Right

After  going  through  the  “metrics  that  matter”  in  the  last  section,  are  you
absolutely convinced you have the right value proposition? You’re about to
live with it for awhile. If you don’t feel that it’s going to win the marketplace
now, it doesn’t get better over time. It may be time to reconfigure, repackage
or  unbundle  the  product.  This  requires  a  loop  all  the  way  back  to  customer
discovery.  Once  there,  use  the  core  technology  to  develop  another  product,
configuration,  distribution  method  or  price  and  then  modify  product
presentations  and  return  to  Phase  3  (product  presentation)  and  do  it  again.
Yes, it hurts, but it hurts far less than failure.

Make Sure the Product Delivery is Right

Even  with  selling  success,  check  the  product  delivery  timing  with  the
product-development  team.  Schedules  inevitably  change,  seldom  for  the
better.  Can  the  company  still  deliver  what  was  just  sold  and  do  so  as
promised,  or  was  the  sale  actually  vaporware?  If  vaporware,  at  best  the
company  secured  a  few  pilot  projects.  Continuing  to  sell  as  if  nothing  has
changed  is  a  bad  idea.  As  schedules  slip,  hard-won  earlyvangelists  weaken,
and  references  evaporate  quickly.  The  good  news  is,  if  this  happens  (it
happens often), the situation is still recoverable. There aren’t many people to
fire, and the burn rate is low. (As discussed earlier, it’s always important to
have  enough  cash  to  get  this  phase  wrong  at  least  once.)  The  solution  is  to
shut down any additional selling for a while, admit mistakes, and turn pilot
projects  into  something  useful—first  for  the  customer  and  then  as  a
marketable product.

Make Sure the Revenue is High and Costs are Low

There’s  nothing  worse  than  leaving  money  on  the  table  or  spending  more

than you needed to. The best way to answer these questions and more is to
“walk” slowly through the business model one more time.

Start  with  the  value  proposition.  Are  there  too  many  features  or  not
enough variety? Would a lower price sell far more units or sell the same
number  at  a  lower  acquisition  cost?  What  if  the  product  were  free,  or
free to those bringing three or five or 10 other customers along?

In the customer-relationships hypothesis, is there rock-solid confidence
in  the  plan,  or  might  a  freemium  or  multi-sided  alternative  deliver
bolder,  faster  growth?  Will  that  costly  AdWords  effort  deliver  the
planned result?

Can a different channel deliver fewer sales and more profit?

Will partners deliver the revenue growth you need and expect?

Are there higher level business model patterns you may have missed?

Make Sure Your Business Model is Right

Grab  a  fresh  business  model  canvas  and  a  pack  of  Post-it  notes.  Explore
alternatives seriously. The team is about to put a big pile of chips, probably
millions, on “red” or “black,” as in “pass” or “fail.” Is everyone confident the
choice is the right?

Changing direction at this juncture is a bold move indeed. It’s not what
the investors expected, especially after a long, grueling process of customer
discovery  and  validation.  Then  again,  bold  moves  are  the  work  of  great
entrepreneurs. And even though a pivot at this point leads to more customer
validation and more time, it’s far better to pivot now than to forge ahead at
full  speed  and  full  spend  if  it’s  possible  that  there’s  a  better  idea  out  there
somewhere.

Further validate the business model, not just looking for enhancements
in  revenue  opportunity  and  places  to  reduce  cost,  but  looking  for  “game
changers.”  Can  you  change  a  product  sold  by  features  into  a  branded-
experience  that  becomes  a  “got-to-have-it”  fashion?  Can  you  change  a
revenue  model  from  a  unit  sale  into  a  network  effects  model?  Look  for  the
non-obvious business patterns. Even if the team is certain the current model
is the best way forward, now’s the time to bring in your advisory board and

have them throw stones (painful as it is) at your canvas. Do they see a huge
move that you missed? No doubt the financial model review just completed
raised  at  least  a  handful  of  questions  and  perhaps  pointed  to  some
opportunities. Revisit the business model checklist questions. Are any of the
answers  different?  Does  the  team  want  to  have  more  money  in  the  bank  or
spend less? Where can savings be effected or additional dollars efficiently put
to good?

If the team has turned over every possibility in its review, looking both
at  radical  changes  and  modest  improvements  in  the  business  model,  and
confidence still carries the day, it’s time to move on to the ultimate question:
pivot or proceed?

The Toughest Startup Question: Pivot or Proceed?

This  is  the  moment  of  truth  when  the  team  and  the  investors  will  vote  on
whether to begin spending massive amounts of money to execute the business
model.  To  vote  honestly,  the  team  needs  to  take  a  hard,  honest  look  at  the
pivot-or-proceed analyses developed in this phase.

As  grueling  as  the  customer  validation  process  is,  it’s  quite  likely  that
the  company  will  require  another  turn  of  the  wheel  before  everyone  can
enthusiastically  vote  to  move  forward.  Don’t  despair—this  need  to  pivot
arises almost every time, and often calls for a return all the way to customer
discovery.

Hubris is the evil twin of a passionate entrepreneur.

The  alternative  is  even  more  painful.  In  the  past,  investors  magically
assumed  flawless  execution  and  fired  executives  who  failed.  It’s  time  to
reflect, thinking seriously about the company’s genuine chances for scalable,
profitable  success.  It’s  a  hard  decision,  particularly  for  self-confident
entrepreneurs  who  pride  themselves  on  their  tenacity,  and  problem-solving
abilities.  “I’m  an  entrepreneur.  I  make  things  happen  against  all  odds”  just
doesn’t  cut  it  when  staring  at  the  hard  facts  and  statistics.  Don’t  confuse
hubris with passion or facts.

Did  validation  really  convert  opinions  to  facts,  or  is  everyone  just
moving  the  goalposts  to  reach  customer  creation?  The  next  step  seriously
cranks  up  the  company’s  cash  burn  rate,  sharply  diminishing  if  not
extinguishing available cash or runway.

Did the product sell well and easily? Is it absolutely, unequivocally clear
that  when  more  money  is  spent  to  acquire  customers,  they’ll  arrive  at  a
steady,  predictable,  profitable  pace?  This  question  in  particular  probably
sends 90 percent of startups back into the depths of Customer Development

 
to refine and retest components of the business model.

If the “ramp” to more customers, revenue and profits isn’t proved to be
predictable  in  test  results,  it’s  also  a  reason  to  pivot.  Using  everything  you
learned in customer validation, go back to Phase 1 of this step (get ready to
sell) and try it again. Sorry. This isn’t easy to do.

If everything checks out (again, it seldom does the first time around), the
end  of  customer  validation  is  a  major  milestone.  Customer  problems  are
understood,  a  set  of  earlyvangelists  has  been  found,  and  the  company  has
delivered  a  product  its  customers  want  to  buy,  developed  a  repeatable  and
scalable  sales  process,  and  demonstrated  a  profitable  business  model.
Hopefully,  all  the  learning  is  captured  in  writing  and  the  business  model
diagram is updated. Fund-raising, while never easy, will be far easier than at
this point than it was before.

When  you’ve  answered  “yes”  to  that  taxing  list  of  questions,  you
deserve a night off, if not a week. Congratulations! The company is prepared
to move full speed ahead to the customer creation process.

A/B  Testing  compares  one  version  of  a  web  page  with  another  and  sees
which produces the best results.

Acquisition is the first step in the web/mobile “get/keep/grow” sales funnel.
It  gets  people  to  visit  your  website,  where  you  can  then  activate  them  by
getting them to engage, purchase, or at least register for future sales efforts.
Specific customer acquisition categories include earned and paid media, and
tactics include search (SEM/SEO), e-mail, PR/blogs, viral, social nets.

Activation  is  the  second  step  in  the  web/mobile  “get/keep/grow”  sales
funnel. After you acquire customers you get them to register, participate or
purchase  on  the  website.  Specific  customer  activation  tactics  include  free
trials, home/landing page.

Agile  Development  is  the  engineering  method  used  to  develop  products
(hardware, software or services) iteratively and incrementally with flexibility
to react to customer feedback. It recognizes that customer needs and the final
product  spec  cannot  be  fully  defined  a  priori.  Agile  is  the  antithesis  of
Waterfall Development.

ARPU, or Average Revenue Per User, is a measurement of revenue typically
applied  by  subscription  services  like  cellphone  or  data  plans  to  measure
average long-term spending.

Awareness. In the physical channel, it is the first step in the “get customers”
sales  funnel.  Tactics  include  earned  media  (pr,  blogs,  brochures,  reviews),
paid media (ads, promotions), online tools

Business Model  is  the  description  of  how  an  organization  creates,  delivers
and  captures  value.  In  this  book  it  specifically  refers  to  Alexander
Osterwalder’s 9-box Business Model Canvas.

Business Plan is a document written by existing companies to describe and

launch  follow-on  or  adjacent  market  products.  It  was  mistakenly  used  for
startups for decades until it was realized that no business plan survives first
contact with customers. Typically has sections labeled: opportunity, industry
background,  competitive  analysis,  marketing  plan,  operations  plan,
management summary and financial plan.

Canvas refers to Alexander Osterwalder’s 9-box Business Model Canvas. In
this book we use the canvas to capture our business model hypotheses and as
a scorecard over time.

Channel is the sales and/or distribution channel. How the product gets from
your  company  to  the  customer.  This  book  talks  about  “physical  channels”
and “web/mobile channels.”

Channel Stuffing fills your sales channel with more product than the channel
has  end-user  demand  for.  Used  as  an  often-illegal  tactic  to  inflate  company
revenue  (when  revenue  is  recognized  as  shipped  to  the  channel,  rather  than
shipped from the channel to the end customer).

Churn  (sometimes  called  Attrition)  is  the  number  of  customers  or
subscribers  who  leave  a  service  in  a  period  of  time.  Usually  measured  in
monthly percentages. If 1 of 10 customers leave, the churn rate is 10%.

Cohort  analysis  is  the  measurement  of  a  specific  unchanging  group  of
customers over time.

Collateral materials are the brochures, data sheets, white papers, sell sheets
and  other  literature  companies  generally  in  physical  channels  develop  to
market their products or services.

Consideration  The  third  step  in  the  physical  purchase  decision  cycle  or
“sales  funnel.”  The  sales  funnel  includes  awareness,  interest,  consideration
and purchase.

Company Building is the fourth of four steps in the Customer Development
process. Founders reorganize the company from one focused on searching for
a business model into building an organization that can execute.

CPA  (cost  per  acquisition)  The  price  web  businesses  pay  to  purchase
referrals or customers from partners or other web businesses.

CPM  (cost  per  thousand)  is  an  advertising  industry  measure  for  purchasing
media, whether it be magazine ad space or banners on websites. Ad pricing is
based on CPM. A magazine selling 6,000,000 copies has 6,000 “M’s” to sell.

Cross-Sell is a tactic to grow existing customers by encouraging them to buy
complementary products, increasing their average order size. “Buy this other
book  and  get  10%  off.”  Or  “buy  this  suitcase  and  add  the  toiletry  kit.”  See

Customer Archetypes are detailed descriptions of customer traits, including
hard  (demographics,  psychographics,  etc.)  and  soft  (interviews,  anecdotal
material)  customer  data  to  form  a  descriptive  profile  and  an  entire  story
about  a  typical  type  or  group  of  the  company’s  customer(s).  (Most  startups
typically have more than one archetypical customer.) Archetypes are used by
both  product  and  customer  development  to  better  focus  on  the  target
customer.

Customer Development first described in the Four Steps to the Epiphany, is
the  four-step  process  to  organize  the  search  for  a  repeatable  and  scalable
business model. Executed by the Customer Development Team.

Customer Development Team replaces the traditional Sales, Marketing and
Business Development in the discovery and validation steps of startups. The
team is responsible for validating the business model hypotheses in front of
customers.  The  team  must  have  at  least  one  founder  with  the  authority  to
change the company’s strategy.

Customer Discovery is the first of the four steps of Customer Development.
In Discovery, founders articulate their hypotheses about the business model
and then run experiments to test problem and solution in front of customers.

Customer  Relationships  are  the  strategies  used  by  companies  to  get
customers into its sales channel, keep them as customers, and over time grow
their value to the company through additional revenue and customer referrals
from them.

Customer Segment defines a single subset of a startup’s customer universe
and how they differ from others, as in “50+ golfers who play more than twice
a month,” often including the a problems/needs they have. Companies define
specific value propositions for each segment.

Customer  Validation  is  the  second  of  the  four  steps  of  Customer
Development. In validation, founders take their tested hypotheses and try to
get initial orders/users/ customers.

Customer  Creation  is  the  third  of  four  Customer  Development  steps.  In
creation, once founders validate their business model, they expand sales and
marketing activities to grow.

Data Chief  is  the  senior  executive  at  mobile/web  companies  who  monitors
and continually optimizes the results of customer acquisition, activation and
retention efforts. Sometimes known as the CMO, VP-Marketing or database
marketer.

Demand  Creation  is  the  specific  set  of  acquisition  activities  to  drive
customers  into  a  startup’s  chosen  sales  channel(s).  It’s  the  “get”  customers
portion of the “Get/Keep/Grow” process of creating Customer Relationships.

Earlyvangelist  is  a  concatenation  of  “early  adopter”  and  “evangelist.”  In  a
startup  earlyvangelists  are  the  company’s  first  customers,  who  buy  the
product  very  early  because  it  solves  a  problem  or  fills  an  urgent  need  for
them.

Earned Media is the free exposure a company generates. It includes a wide
range  of  exposure  tools  including  SEO  or  natural  search,  press  releases,
product  reviews,  editorial  features.  Earned  media  are  part  of  a  company’s
“Get customers” programs.

“Executing” a Business Model is what companies do after they have found
a repeatable and scalable business model. It is how companies grow revenue
once they have refined and proven their plan to do so. It requires significant
organizational changes. See Search.

Experiments are what startups conduct to test hypotheses. Experiments are

designed  as  objective  pass/fail  tests.  For  example:  “We  believe  we  can
acquire users with Google Adwords at a cost of 20 cents per click.”

External Audit: is a survey of outsiders’ perception of the company and/or
its product, gleaned from interviews with consumers.

Eye Tracking  is  a  tool  that  tells  you  the  path  users’  eyes  follow  on  a  web
page. Extremely useful for eliminating guess work in web page design. See
heat maps.

Get,  Keep  and  Grow  activities  are  the  steps  companies  take  to  acquire,
retain  and  grow  their  customers.  Getting  customers,  sometimes  called
demand  creation,  drives  customers  into  a  chosen  sales  channel(s);  Keeping
customers,  or  retention,  gives  customers  reasons  to  stick  with  the  company
and  product;  and  Growing  customers  involves  selling  them  more  and
encouraging them to refer new customers.

“Get  out  of  the  building”  is  a  key  tenet  of  Customer  Development.  It
observes  that  unlike  an  existing  company,  in  a  startup  there  are  no  facts
inside the building, so founders need to get outside to talk to customers. It’s
the  customers  who  can  turn  the  startup’s  many  guesses  about  its  business
model into facts.

Heat Maps are tools that tell you where users’ eyes focus first, second and
third on a web page page. It is based on eye tracking, which literally observes
where users’ eyes go on a web page.

High-fidelity MVP  is  the  simplest  minimum  viable  product  (i.e.  a  website
with  the  core  features  implemented,  a  demo  of  the  physical  product)  and  is
often  quite  rudimentary  or  “rough  and  dirty.”  It  is  used  to  gather  feedback
about the validity of the customer solution. See low-fidelity MVP.

Home Page (sometimes called the “landing” page) is the initial or principal
web  page  of  a  company’s  product  or  website.  See  landing page and splash
page.

Hypotheses  are  the  educated  guesses  a  startup’s  founders  have  about  their
Business  Model  Hypotheses.  Hypotheses  are  drawn  on  the  Business  Model

Canvas,  and  tested  and  refined  throughout  the  Customer  Development
process.

Internal  Audit  is  a  survey  of  what  employees  understand,  perceive,  or
believe  about  the  company,  and  its  product,  and  their  positioning.  See
external audit.

Iteration is a minor change to one or more of the nine boxes of the business
model  canvas.  (For  example,  a  pricing  change  from  $39.99  to  $79.99  or
customer segment from boys 12-15 years old to boys 15-19.) See Pivot.

Interest.  In  the  physical  channel,  Interest  is  one  of  four  steps  in  the  “get
customers” sales funnel. See awareness.

Landing  Page  (sometimes  called  the  “splash”  page)  is  the  web  page  that
appears when a customer clicks on a link, ad, or e-mail. It can sometimes be a
company’s  home  page.  The  landing  page  displays  sales  copy  that  is
connected to the ad or link. See home page.

Lean  Startup  is  a  combination  of  Customer  Development  and  Agile
Development popularized by Eric Ries.

Local/Global Maximum are the results of hypotheses tests, that may show a
short-term  low-level  response  (the  local  maximum).  This  contrasts  with  the
global  maximum  –  the  best  possible  test  result,  sometimes  overlooked  in
short-term market testing.

Low-fidelity  MVP  is  the  simplest  minimum  viable  product  (i.e.  a  landing
page  with  a  sign-up  to  get  more  information,  a  cardboard  mockup  of  a
physical product) used to gather feedback about the validity of the customer
problem. See High-fidelity MVP.

Loyalty  Programs  are  tactics  such  as  “points”  and  “frequent  shopper
programs” used to “keep” existing customers and reduce churn. See churn.

LTV  (LifeTime  Value),  usually  calculated  in  dollars,  reflects  the  total
revenue  a  customer  is  worth  over  the  lifetime  of  his  relationship  with  the
company. (This book arbitrarily picks three years.) LTV helps calculate how

much a company can afford to spend to acquire a customer.

Market Type refers to the four startup market entry strategies:
     1)  entering an existing market with a higher performance product
     2)  resegmenting an existing market (via a niche or low-cost strategy)
     3)  creating a new market where one never existed before
     4)  creating a clone market – copying a business model from another

country

Microsites  are  small  sub-websites  within  a  larger  site  dedicated  to  a  single
purpose  (like  a  retirement  planning  site  with  a  big  bank  website)  that  are
often  used  to  attract  customers’  attention  from  both  within  and  outside  the
site itself.

Minimum  Feature  Set  is  another  term  used  to  describe  Minimum  Viable
Product.

Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the smallest group of features that will
elicit  customer  feedback.  Initially  the  MVP  could  be  as  simple  as  a
PowerPoint slide, a video or demo. For web/mobile products it can be a low-
or  high-fidelity  MVP  that  illustrates  the  “core”  customer  problem/need  and
demonstrates the product’s solution.

Multi-sided  Business  Models  may  have  several  different  customer
segments.  Each  segment  may  have  a  different  value  proposition,  revenue
model  and  channel.  For  example,  Google’s  search  business  has  users  who
pay nothing to use its search site, and an advertiser or payer segment that uses
its AdSense site and pays to reach the search users. Other business models,
such as medical devices, may be even more complex and have four or more
“sides” customer segments such as patients, doctors, insurers and hospitals.

Paid  Media  is  media  exposure  that’s  purchased  on  TV,  billboards,  direct
mail or the web. See earned media. Paid media are part of a company’s “Get
customers” programs.

Physical Channel is a sales and fulfillment channel with physical points of
distribution  and  customer  contact.  Can  include  warehouses,  retail  stores,
direct sales people. See web/mobile channel.

Physical Product is a product made out of atoms. Cars, planes, computers,
and  food  are  physical  products,  but  social  networks  and  search  engines  are
not. See web/mobile products.

Pivot is a substantive change in one or more of the nine boxes of the business
model  canvas.  (For  example,  a  revenue  model  change  from  freemium  to
subscription model or a customer segment shift from boys 12-15 years old to
women 45-60.) See Iteration.

Pricing  describes  the  tactics  a  startup  uses  to  determine  how  much  it  will
charge  in  order  to  implement  a  profitable  revenue  model.  (i.e.  Freemium,
Subscription, tiered or volume pricing, etc.)

Problem/Need  (Customer)  is  why  customers  buy.  In  some  markets
customers rationally recognize they have a problem and search for a product
that  can  solve  it.  (Think  software,  snow  tires,  catheters)  In  other  markets
products  may  be  purchased  for  an  emotionally  perceived  need.  (Movies,
fashion, video games, social networks.)

Product  Development  is  the  engineering  group  building  the  product.  The
process  startup  product  development  teams  most  often  use  to  build  the
product is called Agile Development.

Reference Story is an introductory explanation used when first contacting a
prospect  via  e-mail  or  phone.  It  emphasizes  the  problems  you’re  trying  to
solve, why it’s important to solve them, the solution you’re building, and why
it should be of interest to the prospect.

Revenue Model describes the strategy of how a company will make money.
It  answers  the  question,  “Where  will  the  revenue  be  coming  from?”  For
example,  eBay  makes  a  small  fee  on  every  transaction  on  its  site,  while
Netflix charges a monthly subscription. Also see pricing.

Sales  Closer  is  the  individual  on  the  Customer  Development  Team
responsible  for  “closing”  (bringing  in  the  order)  initial  earlyvangelist  sales.
They  deal  with  the  sales  logistics  founders  may  not  have  experience  with
(negotiating with purchasing agents, contract terms, etc.) They are not sales
managers, and likely not going to become the company’s VP of Sales.

Sales Funnel  is  a  visual  metaphor  for  tracking  sales  progress  shaped  like  a
dumbbell. Consists of “Get/Keep/Grow” activities. Wide at the top with raw
leads coming in, the “Get” stage of the sales funnel narrows at each stage as
the  leads  get  qualified  and  turn  into  suspects,  then  prospects,  then  probable
closes, until finally an order comes out of the narrow neck of the funnel. The
“Keep”  portion  is  narrow  like  a  pipe,  and  the  “Grow”  part  of  the  funnel
widens to represent ever increasing revenue from an existing customer base.

Sales  Roadmap  provides  details  of  how  to  execute  each  step  of  the  sales
funnel: who at a company to call on, in what order, to make a sale.

“Search” for a Business Model is what startups do before they have found a
repeatable  and  scalable  business  model.  Searching  uses  the  Customer
Development process described in this book. See execution.

Sell-in is the first order a channel places for a new product. It can also be a
seasonal order like the pre-Christmas sell-in.

Sell-through  the  volume  of  product  sold  by  the  channel  to  the  ultimate
consumer. When products are “sold through,” they can seldom be returned to
the company. See channel stuffing.

Splash page is an archaic term for landing or home page. See home page.

Split Testing see A/B testing.

Startup is a temporary organization built to search for the answers to what
makes a repeatable and scalable business model.

Take  rate  is  the  percentage  of  customers  accepting  (or  taking)  an  up-sell/
next-sell offer.

Traffic is the measure of how many individuals visit a store or website. They
can  arrive  from  paid  media  (i.e.  Google,  TV,  or  Facebook  ads)  or  earned
media sources (public relations, referrals).

Up-Sell is a tactic used to grow existing customers. It tries to get customers
to  buy  more  units  or  upgrade  to  a  higher  priced  product  to  increase  the

average order size. See Cross-Sell.

Value Proposition describes the job being done for the customer. It includes
features  that  are  solutions  to  customer  problems  or  needs  (productivity,
status,  simplicity,  convenience,  etc.)  for  the  customer  segment(s).  A  value
proposition should match a startup’s customer segment.

Viral  Loop  is  the  process  of  satisfied  customers  referring  others  to  a
business, whether web, mobile or physical. It produces exponential increases
in customer/ users/traffic. See viral marketing.

Viral Marketing are the marketing activities used to stimulate customers to
refer others to the business.

Waterfall Development is the engineering process used to develop products
(hardware, software or services) linearly, sequentially, with a stage-by-stage
method.  The  entire  product  and  all  features  are  specified  up-front.  Each
waterfall  stage  is  assigned  to  a  separate  team  to  ensure  greater  project  and
deadline control. Waterfall is the antithesis of Agile Development.

Web/Mobile Channel is a sales and fulfillment channel using the Internet to
deliver  messages  and  products  to  desktop,  laptop,  and  mobile  devices.  Can
include websites, the cloud, phone app stores. See physical channel.

Web/Mobile Product is a product made out of bits: social networks, video
games, mobile applications are examples. See physical product.

Acknowledgements

I’VE LIVED THREE LIVES. MY FIRST CAREER STARTED in the Air Force during
the  Vietnam  War.  Next,  I  spent  over  two  decades  as  a  Silicon  Valley
technology entrepreneur. Now I’m into my second decade as an educator.

A  few  people  changed  my  life  at  critical  moments.  In  Thailand,  John
Scoggins,  my  first  boss,  took  me  off  a  flight  line  full  of  fighter  planes  and
gunships and gave me part of the electronic warfare shop to run when I was
19.  As  an  entrepreneur  in  my  20s  and  30s,  I  was  lucky  to  have  four
extraordinary mentors, each brilliant in his field: Ben Wegbreit, who taught
me how to think; Gordon Bell, who taught me what to think about; Rob Van
Naarden, who taught me how to think about customers; and Allen Michels,
who  taught  me  how  to  turn  thinking  into  direct,  immediate  and  outrageous
action.

My  eight  technology  startups  had  me  working  with,  around  and  near
some  extraordinary  people:  Bill  Perry,  John  Moussouris,  John  Hennessy,
Skip Stritter, Jon Rubenstein, Glen Miranker, Cleve Moler, Tom McMurray,
John  Sanguinetti,  Alvy  Ray  Smith,  Chris  Kryzan,  Karen  Dillon,  Margaret
Hughes,  Peter  Barrett,  Jim  Wickett,  Karen  Richardson,  Greg  Walsh,  John
McCaskey, and Roger Siboni. Some were active mentors, and others taught
me by osmosis.

Sitting on startup boards, I watched world-class entrepreneurs at work:
Steve  Weinstein,  Fred  Amoroso,  Fred  Durham,  Maheesh  Jain,  and  Will
Harvey. And I got to see how smart and thoughtful venture investors helped
their  companies  solve  problems:  Kathryn  Gould,  Jon  Feiber,  Mike  Maples,
Bill Davidow and many more. At General Electric, I watched Prescott Logan
use Customer Development to create a new Energy Storage division with the
agility of a startup inside a 100-year old company.

As a board member of IMVU, Will Harvey and Eric Ries were the first
corporate guinea pigs to implement the Customer Development process with
me.  As  the  best  student  I  ever  had,  Eric  Ries  had  the  valuable  insight  that
when  Customer  Development  was  combined  with  agile  development,  the
sum  of  two  made  a  powerful  concept  he  called  the  Lean  Startup.  (He  also
named  the  feedback  loop  I  drew  between  the  customer  validation  and

discovery steps, calling it the “Pivot.”)

As one of Japan’s most innovative VCs, Takashi Tsutsumi thought the
Customer  Development  concepts  so  warranted  adoption  in  Japan  that  he
personally  translated  The  Four  Steps  and  evangelized  the  concepts.  Other
entrepreneurs followed with crowd-sourced translations into French, Russian,
Korean and Chinese. Brant Cooper and Patrick Vlaskovits extended my ideas
in  their  helpful  book  The  Entrepreneur’s  Guide  to  Customer  Development.
Alexander  Osterwalder’s  work  about  business  model  design  and  his  book
Business Model Generation are a conceptual breakthroughs that I’ve adopted
as a way to “keep score” for the Customer Discovery process. A big thanks
for his help. Dave McClure’s insights about demand creation for web/mobile
startup  metrics  inspired  the  web  customer  funnel  discussions  in  several
places.

Before anyone took my ideas seriously, Jerry Engel at U.C. Berkeley’s
Haas  Business  School  gave  me  my  first  forum  for  teaching  Customer
Development.  My  first  teaching  partner,  Rob  Majteles,  ensured  that  my
enthusiasm  was  matched  by  a  coherent  syllabus.  At  Stanford  University’s
School  of  Engineering,  Tom  Byers,  Tina  Seelig  and  Kathy  Eisenhardt  were
gracious enough to invite me to teach with them in the Stanford Technology
Venture  Program.  They  offered  additional  insights,  encouragement,  and
enough rope to hang myself when I created my Lean LaunchPad class, a new
way  to  teach  entrepreneurship.  A  big  thanks  to  the  National  Science
Foundation  team  including  Errol  Arkilic,  Don  Millard  and  Babu  DasGupta,
for adopting the Lean LaunchPad class and Customer Development for their
Innovation  Corps.  And  to  Jon  Feiber,  Ann  Miura  Ko,  John  Burke,  Jim
Hornthal,  Alexander  Osterwalder  and  Oren  Jacob  for  teaching  it  with  me.
Finally,  Columbia  Business  School  allowed  me  to  offer  the  course  to  its
students  in  its  joint  MBA  program  with  the  U.C.  Berkeley  Haas  School  of
Business  and  invited  me  to  teach  in  its  short  courses.  I  have  learned
immeasurably from the thousands of students who sat through my classes as
unwitting victims of Customer Development while I experimented with new
ways  to  teach  entrepreneurship.  None  of  these  classes  would  have  worked
without the teaching assistants who kept the wheels on over the years, most
notably Ann Miura-Ko, Thomas Haymore, Bhavik Joshi, Christina Cacioppo,
and Eric Carr.

Besides  the  schools  where  I  regularly  lecture,  other  universities  have
invited  me  to  teach,  lecture  and  learn.  Big  thanks  to:  Professor  Cristobal

Garcia  and  the  Pontificia  Unversidad  Catolica  de  Chile,  in  Santiago;  Dave
Munsen,  dean  of  engineering,  and  Thomas  Zurburchen,  associate  dean  of
entrepreneurship  at  the  University  of  Michigan;  Professor  Nathan  Furr  of
Brigham  Young  University,  who  turned  my  notion  of  business  model
competitions  (instead  of  business  plan  competitions)  into  the  first  formal
contest; at Aalto University in Helsinki, Finland, Tuula Teeri, president, Will
Cardwell  head  of  the  Center  for  Entrepreneurship,  and  Kristo  Ovaska  and
Linda  Liukas,  who  all  welcomed  me;  and  Professor  Tom  Eisenmann  of
Harvard Business School’s Entrepreneurial Management Unit, with whom I
compare notes and teaching strategies in a semi-annual get-together.

Stephen Spinelli was at Babson when he was part of the team that taught
me  how  to  teach  entrepreneurship,  and  when  he  became  president  of
Philadelphia  University,  he  gave  me  something  I  didn’t  deserve.  Carl
Schramm at the Kauffman Foundation turned into a friend in the pursuit of a
new way to think about entrepreneurial education.

Numerous authors have written extensively (and more coherently) about
each of the four steps of Customer Development I cover. A good many of the
building blocks of Customer Development were first articulated by Eric Von
Hippel  (the  Lead  User),  Rita  Gunther  McGrath  and  Ian  MacMillan
(Discovery-driven  Growth),  Mary  Sonnack,  Michael  J.  Lanning,  Michael
Bosworth  (Solution  Selling),  and  Thomas  Freese,  Neil  Rackham,  Mahan
Khalsa,  Stephen  Heiman,  and  Charles  O’Reilly.  Technology  Life  Cycle
Adoption was developed by Joe Bohlen, George Beal and Everett Rogers and
popularized by Geoffrey Moore. Market Type is an extension of the brilliant
work of Clayton Christensen. W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne’s work on
Blue  Ocean  Strategy  was  a  later  influence  on  this  edition  of  the  book.  A
formal process of dealing with the chaos and uncertainty of a startup (and the
company-building  strategies)  owes  a  tremendous  amount  to  the  theories  of
John  Boyd  and  the  OODA  Loop.  Frank  Robinson  independently  came  up
with  many  of  the  concepts  in  the  Customer  Discovery  and  Validation  long
before I wrote about them. Frank coined the term minimum viable product. I
liked it better than minimum feature set, which I used in the first book.

My  partner  and  co-author,  Bob  Dorf,  put  up  with  more  than  any  co-
author  could  imagine.  His  contribution  is  matched  only  by  his  patience.  A
seasoned entrepreneur himself, Bob’s success as a serial entrepreneur and his
strengths in sales, marketing, and the Web have added immensely to our new
joint work. I met Bob when he walked into my E.piphany office. My startup

had five people aboard, and his had about a dozen. I bought his sales pitch,
and he helped me launch E.piphany’s customer development and promotion
efforts. In 2010 he practically moved into my ranch and became my partner
for  the  second  time,  helping  to  make  The  Startup  Owner’s  Manual  a  work
we’re both proud of. The “get/keep/grow” sections and “metrics that matter”
were his painful labor of love. Terri Vanech, our researcher/copyeditor, had
to deal with both of our unreasonable demands.

Thanks  to  our  intrepid  reviewers:  Entrepreneurs  Jake  Levine  at
News.me;  Ross  Gotler;  Peter  Leeds  at  Gabardine.com;  Steve  Weinstein  of
MovieLabs;  Preston  Bealle  and  Prescott  Logan  at  GE’s  Energy  Storage
Technologies;  venture  capitalists  Jon  Feiber  of  MDV,  Ann  Miura-Ko  at
Floodgate,  John  Burke  from  True  Ventures,  Mike  Barlow  of  Cumulus
Partners,  Takashi  Tstusumi  from  Mitsui  Sumitomo  Ventures  and  Errol
Arkilic at the National Science Foundation. Their comments made the book
substantively better by imbuing it with their hundreds of years of collective
wisdom.

Finally, my wife Alison Elliott who not only put up with my obsession
with  finding  a  methodology  for  early-stage  startups  and  my  passion  for
teaching entrepreneurship, but also supported me with her wise counsel and
insight (along with numerous edits) which added clarity to my thinking. This
book would not have happened without her.

About the Authors

Steve Blank

A  RETIRED  EIGHT-TIME  SERIAL  ENTREPRENEUR,  Steve’s  insight  that  startups
are  not  small  versions  of  large  companies  is  reshaping  the  way  startups  are
built  and  how  entrepreneurship  is  taught.  His  observation  that  large
companies execute business models, but startups search for them, led him to
realize that startups need their own tools, different than those used to manage
existing companies.

Steve’s first tool for startups, the Customer Development methodology,
spawned  the  Lean  Startup  movement.  The  fundamentals  of  Customer
Development  are  detailed  in  Blank’s  first  book,  The  Four  Steps  to  the
Epiphany  (2003),  which  together  with  his  blog,  www.steveblank.com,  is
considered  required  reading  among  entrepreneurs,  investors  and  established
companies throughout the world.

Blank teaches Customer Development and entrepreneurship at Stanford
University,  U.C.  Berkeley  Haas  Business  School  and  Columbia  University,
and  his  Customer  Development  process  is  taught  at  universities  throughout
the world. In 2011, he developed the Lean LaunchPad, a hands-on class that
integrates  Business  Model  design  and  Customer  Development  into  practice
through  fast-paced,  real-world  customer  interaction  and  business  model
iteration. In 2011, the National Science Foundation adopted Blank’s class for
its  Innovation  Corps  (I-Corps),  which  trains  teams  of  the  nation’s  top
scientists and engineers to take their ideas out of the university lab and into
the commercial marketplace.

Steve  is  a  prolific  writer  and  speaker  who  enjoys  teaching  young

entrepreneurs.  In  2009,  he  earned  the  Stanford  University  Undergraduate
Teaching  Award  in  Management  Science  and  Engineering.  In  2010,  he
earned the Earl F. Cheit Outstanding Teaching Award at U.C. Berkeley Haas
School of Business. The San Jose Mercury News listed him as one of the 10
Influencers in Silicon Valley. Despite these accolades and many others, Steve
says he might well have been voted “least likely to succeed” in his New York
City high school class.

Eight Startups in 21 years

After repairing fighter plane electronics in Thailand during the Vietnam War,
Steve arrived in Silicon Valley in 1978, and joined his first of eight startups.
These  included  two  semiconductor  companies,  Zilog  and  MIPS  Computers;
Convergent Technologies; a consulting stint for Pixar; a supercomputer firm,
Ardent;  peripheral  supplier,  SuperMac;  a  military  intelligence  systems
supplier,  ESL;  Rocket  Science  Games.  Steve  co-founded  startup  number
eight,  E.piphany,  in  his  living  room  in  1996.  In  sum:  two  significant
implosions, one massive “dot-com bubble” home run, several “base hits,” and
immense learning that resulted in The Four Steps to the Epiphany.

An  avid  reader  in  history,  technology,  and  entrepreneurship,  Steve  has
followed  his  curiosity  about  why  entrepreneurship  blossomed  in  Silicon
Valley  while  stillborn  elsewhere.  It  has  made  him  an  unofficial  expert  and
frequent speaker on “The Secret History of Silicon Valley.”

In  his  spare  time,  Blank  is  a  Commissioner  of  the  California  Coastal
Commission, the public body which regulates land use and public access on
the California coast. Steve served on the boards of Audubon California, the
Peninsula Open Space Land Trust (POST), and was a trustee of U.C. Santa
Cruz  and  a  Director  of  the  California  League  of  Conservation  Voters
(CLCV).  Steve’s  proudest  startups  are  daughters  Katie  and  Sarah,  co-
developed with wife Alison Elliott.

Bob Dorf

BOB DORF  FOUNDED  HIS  FIRST  SUCCESS  AT  AGE 22 and, since then, six more
—“two homeruns, two base hits, and three great tax losses in all,” as he puts
it. He’s advised and/or invested in at least a score more startups since. Dorf is
often  called  the  “midwife  of  Customer  Development,”  having  been  among
the first to help Steve Blank deploy it when Steve’s eighth startup, E.piphany,
opened its doors with five employees in 1996. Bob’s sixth startup, Marketing
1to1, helped E.piphany engage its very first customers. He later critiqued the
early  versions  of  Steve’s  Four  Steps  to  the  Epiphany  mercilessly  along  the
way, and they’ve been friends and colleagues ever since.

When  Bob  and  Steve  aren’t  writing,  Bob  runs  the  K&S  Ranch
consultancy.  Bob’s  deep  experience  consulting  to  Fortune  500  companies
and in online marketing balance Steve’s VC and software-centric experience.
Bob 
teaches  a  full-semester  course  at  Columbia  Business  School,
“Introduction to Venturing,” on Customer Development and getting startups
right.

Entrepreneurial from the age of 12, Bob received his last W-2 almost 40
years  ago,  when  he  quit  his  editor’s  job  at  New  York’s  WINS  Radio  to
launch his first startup. Dorf+Stanton Communications, founded in his living
room, grew from a staff of two—Bob and a St. Bernard—to 150+, when Bob
sold  it  in  1989.  He’s  counseled  dozens  of  nonprofits  probono  on  “donor
development,” as well.

Bob  co-founded  Marketing  1to1  (later  Peppers  &  Rogers  Group),  an
early CRM strategy firm, and drove its growth to 400+ people worldwide. As
founding  CEO,  Dorf  spearheaded  major  strategic  customer  programs  at  a
veritable “who’s who” of companies including 3M, Bertelsmann, Ford, HP,
Jaguar,  NCR,  Oracle,  and  Schwab.  He’s  spoken  before  scores  of  U.S.  and
international audiences, and published dozens of articles including an indepth

Harvard Business Review treatise.

Dorf lives in Stamford, Connecticut, with his wife Fran, a therapist and
thrice-published  novelist.  His  proudest  startup  by  far  is  daughter  Rachel,  a
psychologist  who  recently  co-founded  Bob’s  first  grandchild,  Maya  Rose
Gotler.
