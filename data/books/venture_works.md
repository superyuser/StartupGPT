That Thing Venture Capitalists Do
Mitchell Berlin*

One key to economic prosperity is the ease

with which promising new goods and technolo-
gies are identified, developed, and brought to
the attention of the consumers and firms that
use  them.  But  there  is  no  single  blueprint  or
framework for guiding an idea from its begin-
ning as a lightbulb over an inventor’s head to
its  ultimate  destination—the  assembly  line,
drugstore, or desktop. One such framework, the
venture capital industry, is a unique contribution

of the U.S. financial system, although one that
is increasingly being copied around the world.
The  central  role  of  venture  capital  in  some  of
the best known success stories of recent years—
Microsoft, Genentech, and Federal Express, to
name  just  a  few—has  put  the  industry  in  the
headlines.

Although  just  about  everyone  knows  the
term  venture  capital,  not  many  people  know
precisely what venture capitalists do: How do
they  identify  entrepreneurs  with  promising
new ideas? What kinds of services do they pro-
vide to these entrepreneurs? What role do they
play  in  helping  entrepreneurs  secure  funds?

JANUARY/FEBRUARY  1998

How successful has the venture capital indus-
try actually been? It’s only in the last few years
that  financial  economists  have  begun  to  care-
fully describe and analyze the distinctive fea-
tures of the venture capital market and provide
systematic answers to questions like these.1

An understanding of the venture capital in-
dustry  is  important  to  policymakers  in  the
United States and abroad. Some policymakers
in the United States believe that the government
can adapt the institutions of the venture capi-
tal  industry  to  increase  small  firms’  access  to
external finance. And outside the United States,
policymakers  debate  ways  to  nurture  the
growth of domestic venture capital industries,
while businessmen are already busily starting
venture capital firms.  Such public policies are
more  likely  to  succeed  if    their  designers  un-
derstand what makes the venture capital indus-
try tick.2

WHO NEEDS A VENTURE CAPITALIST?

Why  Al  Needs  a  Venture  Capitalist.  Con-
sider  Al  B.  Gates—an  industrial  biologist,
turned  entrepreneur—who  was  recently  rein-
carnated as the startup firm Alpha Biotronics.
Alpha  holds  the  patent  on  a  smart  bacterium
that was conceived in Al’s basement lab. Until
now, Alpha has covered its costs using a patch-

Christopher  Barry’s  article  contains  a  review  of  much  of
the  recent  academic  literature  on  venture  capital,  includ-
ing important theoretical contributions that I don’t discuss.
Paul Gompers’ 1994 essay presents a fascinating history of
the venture capital industry.

2See Josh Lerner’s 1996 analysis of the Small Business
Innovation Research program for an example of one gov-
ernment program that has tried to provide venture capital
to small, high-technology firms.  Also, see Paul Gompers’
1994 article and the Staff Study by George Fenn, Nellie Liang
and  Stephen  Prowse  for  discussions  of  the  changing  for-
tunes  of  small  business  investment  corporations  (SBICs),
which were established by the Small Business Investment
Act of 1958 to provide risk capital to small businesses.

work  of  financing  sources,  most  recently  an
$80,000  equity  investment  by  a  retired  local
businessman, who made his own small fortune
in biologics and who was introduced to Al by a
mutual friend in the biological community.  This
businessman—an  angel  in  market  lingo—has
not only provided funds but has also given Al
useful advice about developing a coherent busi-
ness plan.3

However,  angels  seldom  invest  more  than
$100,000,  and  the  firm  now  needs  a  lot  more
than  that.  Also,  Alpha’s  management  team
lacks the marketing and financial experience to
complement Al’s technical and industry exper-
tise, but the businessman simply hasn’t the time
or contacts to help Alpha recruit professionals
with the appropriate skills. Alpha’s angel has
played a central role in moving the firm to the
next  stage,  but  further  financing  must  come
from elsewhere.

Alpha investigated the possibility of a long-
term bank loan, but it became immediately clear
that banks simply won’t lend to startup firms
in  untested  markets,  especially  firms  without
tangible assets to post as collateral.4  And even
under the most optimistic business plan, Alpha
doesn’t forecast revenues high enough to make
interest payments any time soon. What Al needs
is a venture capitalist, but he’s not the only one.
Why Calipers Needs a Venture Capitalist.
Calipers is one of the largest employee pension
funds in the United States. For a number of rea-
sons, Calipers is the type of investor that might

3Although there are no reliable data, analysts estimate
that annual investment in the angel market is roughly $20
billion, about five times as large as the yearly investment
in the venture capital market over the last 15 years. Many
firms that receive venture capital funding have previously
received angel financing. See William Wetzel’s article for a
description of the angel market.

find  venture  capital  investments  particularly
attractive. The returns on its portfolio are used
to pay retirement benefits for the plan’s benefi-
ciaries, so its liabilities—the promised payments
to beneficiaries—are long term. Thus, Calipers
can be a patient investor. Calipers is also very
large and well diversified; the pension fund can
afford to have some investments that don’t pan
out at all in exchange for the possibility of some
real winners.

If Alpha seems like an ideal investment for
Calipers, why doesn’t the pension fund make
the  investment  directly,  instead  of  through  a
venture capitalist (whose services do not come
cheaply)? The main reason is that a large diver-
sified  pension  fund  can’t  develop  specific  ex-
pertise on a wide range of industries, especially
those  that  exist  primarily  in  entrepreneurs’
imaginations.  Deciding whether Alpha’s smart
bacterium has real commercial applications and
then working closely with novice managers like
Al to bring his bacterium to market would de-
mand a level of focused attention on single in-
vestments  that  Calipers’  portfolio  managers
can’t provide. To get in at the ground floor of
the  coming  nanotechnology  revolution,  Cali-
pers needs a venture capitalist.

VENTURE CAPITALISTS AND OTHER  IN-
TERMEDIARIES

How Does a Venture Capital Firm Work?5
The typical venture capitalist is a member of a
small, independent partnership with a profes-
sional  staff  of  between  six  and  12  people,  in-
cluding a few general partners and a small num-
ber of associates who are venture capitalists in
training. Venture capital firms are small: In 1996

5Much of the information in this section about the typi-
cal activities of the venture capital fund is drawn from the
pioneering  work  by  William  Sahlman.  Some  of  the  more
recent numbers are drawn from the study by Fenn, Liang,
and  Prowse,  which  contains  a  description  of  the  broader
private equity market.

the typical partnership managed between $50
and $99 million in assets, and nearly three-quar-
ters  of  all  venture  capital  firms  managed  be-
tween  $25  million  and  $250  million  in  assets.
In  comparison,  in  1996  the  average  U.S.  com-
mercial bank had a portfolio of more than $481
million  and  the  100th  largest  bank  had  more
than $7 billion in assets.

Consider  Splice  and  Dysem  Associates
(S&D), a 10-year-old venture capital firm with
four general partners managing total assets of
$80  million.  The  firm’s  particular  investment
focus is biologics—especially the interface be-
tween microorganisms and microprocessors—
and  most  of  S&D’s  investments  are  in  early-
stage firms. Splice and Dysem first met as MBA
students at Stanford after Dysem had given up
an unsatisfying academic career in biology and
Splice had gained experience (and lost his shirt)
as owner of a failed software startup firm. Like
most  other  venture  capital  firms—including
ones with less specialized portfolios—S&D in-
vests almost exclusively in firms located not too
far from the partners’ homes in the San Fran-
cisco area.

S&D  currently  has  two  separate  venture
capital funds running. (See The Venture Capital
Fund.)  The first fund is now seven years old,
and its 25 portfolio firms—those firms in which
the venture capital fund invests—are now gen-
erating returns for investors. Some firms have
been sold to larger companies, and one portfo-
lio firm went public with an initial public offer-
ing (IPO) in the hot market of 1993. Nearly two
years ago, S&D started a second fund, follow-
ing  a  pattern  typical  of  the  industry:  Venture
capitalists  plan  to  start  a  new  fund  approxi-
mately five years into the life of their previous
fund.  No new firms are added to the portfolio
of the earlier fund beyond this point, while the
venture capital firm harvests the returns on its
previous  investments. At  the  end  of  10  years,
the first fund will be wound up, and all of its
remaining cash and securities will be divided
up among the fund’s investors (including S&D).

JANUARY/FEBRUARY  1998

The Venture Capital Funda

Organization of the Fund. The typical venture capital fund is organized as a limited partnership,
in  which  the  venture  capitalist—the  general  partner—invests  1  percent  of  the  funds  and  the  other
investors—the limited partners—invest the remainder.b  Investors make an initial investment and also
a  commitment  to  provide  funds  up  to  some  maximum  dollar  amount  during  the  life  of  the  fund.
Limited partnerships have a fixed maturity, usually 10 years for venture capital funds, with an option
to extend the life of the fund up to three years. At the end of the fund’s life, all cash and securities on
hand are distributed to the fund’s investors.

Management of the Fund.  As general partner, the venture capitalist plays an active role in man-
aging the portfolio, but the fund’s limited partners are not permitted to play an active management
role.  However,  the  fund’s  investors  do  have  limited  voting  rights  concerning  some  decisions,  for
example, whether the fund’s life should be extended at maturity. Investors also exercise some control
through covenants, contractually agreed rules that place restrictions on the investment decisions of
the  venture  capitalist.c    For  example,  one  common  covenant  limits  personal  investments  by  fund
managers in portfolio firms.

Compensation  Scheme.    The  venture  capitalist’s  compensation  has  both  a  fixed  and  a  variable
component.d  The fixed component is a management fee, usually 2 to 3 percent of the funds already
invested. The variable component is approximately 20 percent of the fund’s profits—often called the
carried interest—which is commonly paid to the venture capitalist only after investors have recovered
their investment. (However, this strict priority scheme is not universal.) The remaining 80 percent of
the fund’s profits go to the investors.

aSahlman’s article contains an illuminating discussion of the structure of the venture capital fund.

bIn the 1980s the limited partnership replaced the closed-end mutual fund as the primary organizational form
for the venture capital fund.  In this article, I do not examine the interesting question: Why has the limited partner-
ship become the dominant organizational form for venture capital investments? Tax considerations are probably
not the main explanation, unlike limited partnerships in oil and gas exploration and in real estate. See Fenn, Liang,
and Prowse’s study for a discussion of the growth of the limited partnership in the venture capital industry.

cSee Gompers and Lerner’s 1996 article for a detailed analysis of the functions of different covenants and how

the types of covenants have changed over time.

d Gompers and Lerner’s 1995 working paper contains a careful empirical investigation of compensation schemes.

When Splice and Dysem started their firm,
they had a Rolodex full of contacts but no track
record,  and  it  took  them  nearly  two  years  to
line up financial commitments from investors
for their first fund.  But with investors in their
initial  fund  now  happily  receiving  returns  on
their investment—and especially with the well-
publicized IPO by one of their portfolio firms—
S&D has found it much easier to line up com-
mitments for its second fund. In fact, the sec-

ond  fund  was  fully  subscribed  within  four
months, a possibility only for firms with good
track records.

Roughly two-thirds of the financing for the
funds comes from institutional investors such
as  pension  funds,  insurance  companies,  and
university  endowments  (Figure).  This  pattern
has  been  typical  of  the  industry  since  1979,
when  pension  funds  began  investing  in  ven-
ture capital funds after the Labor Department

liberalized  its  interpretation  of  the  “prudent
man” rule under ERISA (the Employee Retire-
ment Income Security Act).6  Indeed, this rul-
ing not only changed the composition of inves-
tors in the venture capital industry but also in-
creased the total flow of funds into the indus-
try.7

Venture  Capitalists  Are  Like  Other  Inter-
mediaries in Some Ways . . . In addition to lin-
ing  up  funds,  each  partner  at  S&D  spends  a
large  block  of  time  screening  potential  invest-
ments,  much  like  a  bank  loan  officer  evaluat-
ing a loan application. However, the rejection
rate is very high. A single partner will receive
100  proposals  per  year,  but  most  will  be  dis-
missed after a cursory look. Perhaps 10 of the
initial 100 proposals will reach the stage where
two of the firm’s partners examine the deal in
detail,  and of these 10, the assembled partners
will agree to fund only one or two.

One way that venture capitalists think about
potential investments is to ask what rate of re-
turn the investment will yield. Like many other
venture  capitalists  specializing  in  early  stage
firms, S&D’s partners insist that any firm they
fund have an annual rate of return of at least 60
percent,  assuming  that  the  investment  suc-
ceeds.8 To get a feeling for how high this cutoff

return  is,  note  that  the  average  annual  return
on  the  S&P  500  since  1945  has  been  8.33  per-
cent. A lower return simply wouldn’t justify the
time  spent  by  a  venture  capitalist  in  oversee-
ing  the  firm,  especially  given  the  substantial
likelihood of losses. 9

Also, like commercial bankers or investment
bankers, venture capitalists act as consultants for
their portfolio firms. But the consulting side of
the  venture  capitalist’s  relationship  with  its
portfolio firms is more important than it is for
other types of intermediaries, since the startup
firm’s  management  is  often  inexperienced.
Over  the  years,  S&D’s  partners  have  built  up
many contacts in the local business community,
and they can recommend a trustworthy accoun-
tant  or  put  the  entrepreneur  in  touch  with  a
reliable supplier of lab equipment.

...But Venture Capitalists Play a More Ac-
tive Governance Role Than Other Intermedi-
aries.  In the United States, commercial bank-

The cutoff return will be lower for later-stage venture capi-
tal investments, since they are less risky.

9Sahlman’s article provides historical evidence that more
than a third of venture capital investments incur a loss and
nearly 12 percent involve a total loss of funds.

6Under this rule, pension funds are
limited to investments that would be
undertaken by a prudent investor on
his own behalf.

7Before 1978, new commitments to
venture  capital  funds  had  never  ex-
ceeded $0.5 billion (in 1993 dollars).  In
1979, new commitments exceeded $1
billion for the first time and averaged
over  $4  billion  in  new  commitments
per  year  throughout  the  1980s.  (See
Gompers 1994.)

8The investment horizon for deter-
mining  the  rate  of  return  is  the  time
until the firm is taken public or sold.

ers  and  investment  bankers  seldom  play  an
active  role  in  making  strategic  decisions  for
firms,  nor  do  they  play  a  significant  role  in
choosing or dismissing management. However,
active  governance  is  a  specialty  of  the  venture
capitalist.    Now  that  S&D’s  partners  have
agreed  to  invest  in Alpha—after  weeks  of  in-
tense  negotiations  over  contract  terms—Al
knows  that  Dysem,  the  partner  assigned  to
watch closely over Alpha’s affairs, will not be a
passive investor.

At the partners’ meeting where Dysem first
presented the Alpha deal, the expected rate of
return and other financial projections were not
the  main  objects  of  discussion.  As  one  real-
world venture capitalist says: “If you can’t do
the math in your head, it’s probably not a ven-
ture deal.”10 For S&D to finance a firm, one of
the partners must have the time and commit-
ment to sit on the firm’s board of directors, al-
though the partner won’t necessarily play such
an active role unless the firm experiences sig-
nificant problems, especially those requiring a
change in the firm’s management.11 In any case,
Dysem  expects  to  visit Alpha  about  20  times
during the year and to spend 110 hours in di-
rect contact with Alpha’s managers, either over
the  phone  or  face-to-face.     And  since  she  al-
ready oversees eight other portfolio firms and
sits on the board of directors of five, this is not
a  trivial  commitment.  Like  the  other  partners
in  the  firm,  she  will  take  on  oversight  of  two
new firms each year, but no more.

These extensive oversight activities (and the
high probability of losses) are the reasons that
only firms with extraordinary prospects can be
considered. The need for close contact with the
portfolio firm and time spent traveling to board
meetings  also  explain  why  S&D  acts  as  lead

investor only for firms within a reasonable com-
mute of the San Francisco area.12

THE VENTURE CAPITALIST
HAS MANY LEVERS OF CONTROL

The Staging of Finance.  The venture capi-
talist doesn’t make her investment all at once.
Instead,  funds  are  always  provided  in  stages,
and  the  entrepreneur  receives  only  enough
funding to reach the next stage.13

In  part,  the  staging  of  finance  reflects  the
venture  capitalist’s  view  of  a  firm’s  develop-
ment  as  a  series  of  milestones,  in  which  risks
are reduced one by one.14  For example, seed fi-
nancing  allows  the  entrepreneur  to  produce  a
prototype of a new good. During this stage, the
entrepreneur proves that the design is feasible,
but  has  yet  to  establish  whether  it  is  market-
able, much less profitable. Each stage has well-
defined  performance  objectives,  and  more
funds  are  provided  if  performance  objectives
are met.

If    performance  objectives  are  not  met,  the
venture capitalist must make a decision.  Should
the  portfolio  firm’s  strategy  be  reconsidered?
Should  the  firm’s  management  team  be
changed? And in the worst case, should fund-
ing be cut off completely? Even if the venture
capitalist  decides  to  provide  more  funds,  the
entrepreneur will pay a price. The venture capi-

12When  a  promising  investment  outside  the  venture
capitalist’s  geographical  area  turns  up,  it  may  be  passed
on to another venture capital firm, which becomes the lead
investor—the firm with primary oversight responsibilities.
The firm that first identified the investment may then be-
come part of a syndicate, in which different firms share the
role of venture capitalist. See Lerner’s 1994(a) article for a
discussion of syndication practices.

13Gompers’ 1995 article has an extensive analysis of the

staging of finance.

talist inevitably demands a larger share of the
firm’s stock in return for additional funding to
meet  some  objective. 15    This  fall  in  the
entrepreneur’s ownership share of the firm di-
minishes  his  influence  and  reduces  his  future
expected returns.

The severity of the penalties for not meeting
objectives, which range from a reduced owner-
ship  share  to  being  replaced  altogether,  pro-
vides  the  entrepreneur  with  powerful  incen-
tives to work exceptionally hard and also gives
the venture capitalist lots of power to influence
the firm’s direction.

The Venture Capitalist Holds Convertible
Securities. The securities that the venture capi-
talist receives in exchange for investing funds
in the portfolio firm are more complicated than
simple debt or equity contracts. While the se-
curities  are  relatively  complicated,  the  main
idea  behind  their  design  is  straightforward.
Some  of  the  contractual  features  increase  the
venture capitalist’s influence, while others push
the  venture  capitalist  to  use  this  influence  in
ways that increase the firm’s value.

The venture capitalist usually receives  con-
vertible preferred stock. Like a debt contract, pre-
ferred stock requires the firm to make fixed pay-
ments to the stock’s holder.16 And the promised

15Both the objectives and the consequences of failing to
achieve  them  may  be  written  down  in  the  funding  con-
tract, in what are termed “milestone” or “benchmark” deals.
This is common in high-tech, early-stage financings. In other
deals, there is an implicit understanding between the firm
and the venture capitalist about the objectives that must be
met  to  move  to  a  subsequent  stage.    When  contracts  are
implicit, reputational concerns limit the venture capitalist’s
ability  to  increase  her  ownership  share  by  threatening  to
withhold funds.

payments  must  be  made  before  any  common
stockholder gets dividend payments, that is, the
preferred  stockholder  has  priority  over  com-
mon stockholders. Hence, the venture capital-
ist can make sure that the entrepreneur is not
paying himself a high salary disguised as divi-
dends. It also means that if things turn out badly
and the firm is liquidated, the venture capital-
ist gets back her investment in the firm before
the entrepreneur gets paid anything.

Unlike preferred stockholders in many other
settings, the venture capitalist usually has vot-
ing  rights.  In  addition,  the  venture  capitalist
usually has a right of redemption, which means
that she can cash out her shares at some prede-
termined  price  whenever  she  wants.  Along
with the fixed payments, both of these features
give  the  venture  capitalist  multiple  levers  of
control—as well as a way to make a quick exit
if prospects look bad.

With so many features that increase the ven-
ture capitalist’s influence, a well-designed con-
tract  should  also  have  features  leading  her  to
use  this  influence  in  sensible  ways.  This  is
where the convertibility feature comes in.17 The
right to convert her financial claims into shares
of common stock focuses the venture capitalist’s
attention on the firm’s market value. Since the
firm’s  common  stock  will  be  valuable  only  if
the firm does well, the venture capitalist’s vi-
sion  is  fixed  on  maximizing  the  value  of  the
firm’s  stock  and  ensuring  that  the  firm  suc-
ceeds.    In  particular,  any  incentive  to  cut  her

made at the firm’s discretion, and they can be deferred by
the  firm’s  board  of  directors  without  creating  a  legal  de-
fault. Since venture-financed firms are seldom making cur-
rent  profits,  the  promised  dividends  usually  accrue  until
they can be paid at a later date.

16In many ways, preferred stock is more like debt than
equity, and it is priced accordingly in the marketplace. In
addition to contractually fixed payments, preferred stock
has a fixed liquidation value per share, quite similar to a
bond’s  face  value.  However,  unlike  interest  payments  on
debt,  dividend  payments  to  preferred  stockholders  are

17There is substantial variation in the details of funding
arrangements  between  venture  capitalists  and  portfolio
firms, but the venture capitalist’s right to convert her secu-
rity into voting common stock appears to be more or less
universal. Sahlman’s article contains an extensive analysis
of standard funding arrangements.

losses and run too quickly is reduced.

A strict focus on the value of the firm’s stock
also goes a long way toward creating a harmony
of  interest  between  the  entrepreneur  and  the
venture  capitalist.  Both  the  entrepreneur  and
the venture capitalist have a strong interest in
seeing the value of the firm’s stock go as high
as  possible,  since  this  increases  the  wealth  of
both.

But perfect harmony is impossible. Although
Alpha  Biotronics’  founder  may  be  a  brilliant
nanobiologist, there is no guarantee that Al can
manage  a  commercial  firm  or  fix  his  gaze  on
the commercialization of smart bacteria. Al’s ear-
liest vision was that smart bacteria would build
structures  on  distant  planets  (and  win  him  a
Nobel prize).  But this conflicts with Dysem’s
more commercial view that smart bacteria will
build  condos  at  even  lower  cost  than  prefab.
And Al’s  tenacity  in  the  face  of  repeated  fail-
ure—a  necessary  trait  for  a  successful  inven-
tor—turns out to be plain stubbornness when
Dysem insists that Al give up control to a pro-
fessional manager. In a less noble vein, Al also
likes the perks of being the boss of his own firm.
So why is Al willing to give up so much con-
trol  to  S&D?  While  we  may  sympathize  with
Al’s dream of becoming the next Bill Gates, the
venture capitalist’s substantial power to over-
rule  the  entrepreneur  makes  economic  sense:
Investors will be reluctant to place their money
in  such  high-risk  investments  unless  contrac-
tual  mechanisms  reduce  risks  as  quickly  and
completely as possible. Al knowingly left him-
self open to the risk of losing control over his
own firm as a condition of getting funding in
the first place.18

For a new product, we tend to think that the
biggest risks are technological, for example, that
it might not work as planned (“can we split the

atom?”).19  But managerial incompetence or the
inability to identify the most valuable commer-
cial use of the product is more likely to derail a
start-up firm than technological bugs (“will the
dogs eat the dog food, or the fish jump out of
the tank?”).  In a 1989 survey by Gorman and
Sahlman, venture capitalists identified manage-
ment failure as the most important reason their
own past investments came to naught. Venture
capitalists see themselves as overcoming risks,
especially  the  risks  of  poor  management  and
mistaken market strategies.

TAKING FIRMS PUBLIC IS THE
VENTURE CAPITALIST’S MAIN GOAL

Foremost in most venture capitalists’ minds
is an exit strategy. The venture capitalist expects
to have an intense involvement with each port-
folio firm for three to five years, at which time
the successful firm is merged with or acquired
by another firm or goes public in an IPO.20  In
the  venture  capital  market,  the  portfolio  firm
that goes public generates nearly all of the re-
turns.21 It is also the “home run” that establishes
a venture capitalist’s reputation. Venture capi-
talists who have previously taken firms public
find  it  easier  to  secure  commitments  from  in-
vestors  and  organize  new  funds. And  in  the
aggregate there is a clear relationship between
newly committed funds and IPO activity: When
the IPO market is hot, new funds flow into the
venture capital industry.22

Kleiner Perkins Caulfield & Byers. They are reported in John

tal investments of just under five years.

21In  one  study  cited  by  Sahlman,  Venture  Economics
reported that IPOs yielded a return of 60 percent over four
years while acquisitions yielded only 15 percent and liqui-
dations lost 80 percent of their value.

That Thing Venture Capitalists Do

The central role of public equity markets in
the  venture  capital  process  is  one  of  its  most
distinctive features. Multiple pressures push the
venture  capitalist  to  bring  the  portfolio  firm
public as soon as possible, yet these pressures
serve valuable functions.

Investors Need an Objective Measure of the
Venture  Capitalist’s  Performance.  Investors
find  it  very  difficult  to  evaluate  the  venture-
backed firm’s performance, and, in turn, they
find it hard to evaluate how well the venture
capitalist  is  doing  with  their  funds.  The  ven-
ture-backed  firm  usually  has  few  tangible  as-
sets and is invariably suffering operating losses,
so standard balance-sheet measures of perfor-
mance—such as the rate of return on assets—
are not very useful. The firm may be the only
one of its type around, or it may be one of many
firms  vying  to  be  the  first  to  come  to  market
with a product that has yet to be produced prof-
itably.  So, searching for similar firms as a basis
for comparison is useless. For accounting pur-
poses,  the firms in the venture fund’s portfolio
are simply carried at their book value—which
means they are valued at the amount of funds
invested—until the firm moves on to the next
stage, is sold to another firm, or goes public.

Even if investors had some way to determine
the true value of the firms in the fund’s portfo-
lio  when  they  commit  their  money—and  the
commitment is usually for 10 years—the ven-
ture capitalist will continue to add firms for five
years.23  So the portfolio keeps changing. While
venture capital funds typically have covenants
that restrict the venture capitalist’s investment
choices, no tablet of rules can foresee or solve
all problems.

It  is  not  hard  to  imagine  the  worries  of  an

23Funding  commitments  by  investors  are  not  irrevo-
cable, but the penalties for refusing to honor the commit-
ments  are  substantial.  Furthermore,  money  already  in-
vested can’t be withdrawn, and the legal rules governing
limited partnerships severely limit investors’ ability to sell
their shares in the fund.

investor whose funds are tied up for 10 years
and  who  has  no  way  to  judge  or  control  the
fund  manager’s  performance.  Since  manage-
ment fees are calculated as a percentage of the
fund’s assets, how can the investor be sure that
the  venture  capitalist  is  not  maximizing  fund
size, rather than fund value? And since the ven-
ture capitalist usually must pay investors back
before  receiving  any  profits—and  has  made
only a tiny share of the initial investment—how
can the investor be sure that the venture capi-
talist is not taking big risks on firms with poor
prospects, hoping for positive returns through
dumb luck?

What the fund’s investors need is an  objec-
tive  way  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  the
fund. This is what market participants do when
a  portfolio  firm  is  taken  public. At  this  time,
market  participants  judge  the  venture
capitalist’s performance by how much they are
willing to pay for the portfolio firm’s stock. And
since  the  venture  capitalist’s  compensation  is
tied to asset values—both through the manage-
ment  fee  and  through  the  profit-sharing
scheme—investors have an objective measure
for dividing up portfolio returns.

Bringing Firms to Market Allows the Ven-
ture  Capitalist  to  Shift  Effort  to  New  Firms.
The successful venture capitalist’s unique mix
of  skills  includes  securing  financing,  evaluat-
ing ideas and managers, and building success-
ful  management  teams.  Once  risks  have  been
reduced sufficiently, especially with a function-
ing  management  team  in  place,  it  would  be
wasteful  for  the  venture  capitalist  to  commit
so much time and so many resources to the firm.
Once a firm has gone public or been sold, it
no longer depends on the venture capitalist for
funds, and the venture capitalist’s responsibili-
ties  for  governance  are  substantially  reduced.
And  since  starting  a  new  fund  roughly  five
years into the life of the preceding fund is the
general  rule-of-thumb,  the  venture  capitalist
can now shift attention back to the task of build-
ing firms.

BUSINESS  REVIEW

JANUARY/FEBRUARY  1998

DOES THE FOCUS ON TAKING FIRMS
PUBLIC PROMOTE A SHORT TIME
HORIZON?

Some academic specialists and venture capi-
talists  believe  that  the  powerful  pressure  to
quickly bring firms to market promotes exces-
sively short time horizons. Moreover, they ar-
gue that these pressures have increased as in-
stitutions  such  as  pension  funds  have  gained
importance  as  investors  in  venture  capital
funds. Even though institutions would appear
to be naturally patient investors,  market pres-
sures  can  force  institutional  money  managers
to  focus  on  immediate  payoffs.24  These  pres-
sures on institutional money managers are then
transmitted to the venture capitalist.

In fact, there is evidence that less experienced
venture  capitalists  take  firms  public  too  early
in order to establish a reputation, a practice that
has been called grandstanding.  Grandstanding
is costly for both the entrepreneur and the ven-
ture  capitalist,  since  the  earlier  the  firm  goes
public,  the  lower  the  price  that  investors  are
willing to pay for the firm’s securities.

But a lower price for a portfolio firm’s secu-
rities may not be the only problem.  Subjecting
a  fledgling  firm  to  the  scrutiny  of  the  public
market before it is ready may reduce the firm’s
long-term likelihood of success. Even more sig-
nificant,  pressure  to  bring  portfolio  firms  to
market  too  early  may  bias  the  venture
capitalist’s  investment  decisions  away  from
early stage firms toward later-stage firms. Thus,
highly promising start-up firms might never get
funded. 25

Some  Mechanisms  Promote  a  Long-Term
View.  Even if certain pressures drive venture

capitalists to push firms to market too quickly,
the  venture  capital  market  also  has
countervailing  mechanisms.

When a portfolio firm goes public, the ven-
ture  capitalist  doesn’t  just  unload  her  invest-
ment  and  cash  out,  but  instead  retains  a  sub-
stantial stake in the firm. For example, in one
study  of  venture-backed  IPOs  between  1978
and 1987, venture capitalists held 34.3 percent
of the firm’s equity before the offering and re-
tained 24.6 percent of the firm’s equity follow-
ing  the  offering.    (In  nearly  60  percent  of  the
cases  in  this  sample,  the  venture  capitalists
didn’t sell any of their stock.) And after a year,
the average holdings fell to only 17.8 percent.26
Retaining  a  substantial  financial  commitment
to  the  firm  after  the  IPO  focuses  attention  on
the firm’s longer term prospects.

The design of the venture capital fund also
promotes  a  long-term  view.  The  venture
capitalist’s investors have made a 10-year com-
mitment to provide money, with an option to
extend this commitment up to three more years.
This setup reduces pressure on the venture capi-
talist to rush a firm to market if, for example, a
number  of  firms  in  the  fund  portfolio  are  de-
veloping more slowly than expected.27  It also

25See Gompers’ 1996 article for evidence of grandstand-
ing and his 1994 article for a discussion of the influence of
institutional  investors.  There  is  some  evidence  of  a  shift
toward later-stage investments following the entry of many
institutional  investors  into  the  venture  capital  market  in
the early 1980s. But viewed over a longer period, there is
evidence of a renewed shift toward early-stage investments.
This reversal casts some doubt on claims that institutional
investors are the cause of a bias toward short-term results
in the venture capital industry.

24This  point  is  made  forcefully  in  the  article  by  Josef
Lakonishok, Andrei  Shleifer,  and  Robert  Vishny.  Relative
performance  evaluation,  in  which  a  fund  manager  is  re-
warded and penalized according to how well he does com-
pared with other fund managers, can promote a short-term
horizon. This can be viewed as an agency cost of delegat-
ing investment decisions.

26This evidence is from the article by Christopher Barry,
Chris  Muscarella,  John  Peavy,  and  Michael  Vetsuypens.
They  also  find  that  investors  seem  to  view  the  venture
capitalist’s involvement as a certification of a firm’s qual-
ity. For more empirical evidence on the role of venture capi-
talists  in  IPOs,  see  the  article  by  William  Megginson  and
Kathleen Weiss and Josh Lerner’s 1994(b) article.

lessens  the  pressure  to  force  a  merger  with  a
larger firm if the IPO market is cold. The setup
of the venture capital fund is well adapted to
reducing  pressures  on  venture  capitalists  to
choose myopic exit options.

CONCLUSION

  Despite  vibrant  growth  during  the  stock
market  and  IPO  boom  of  the  mid-1990s,  the
venture capital industry is quite small if mea-
sured by the amount of funds mobilized. Even
the  $6.2  billion  of  new  funds  committed  in
1996—a  healthy  jump  from  the  $3  billion  per
year of the 1980s—is tiny when compared with
$184 billion spent on research and development
in  the  United  States  in  1996.  But  a  list  of    the
venture-backed  firms  that  have  grown  to
prominence in the 1990s suggests that the ven-
ture  capital  industry  has  had  an  effect  out  of
proportion to the dollars invested.

27Some  venture  capital  firms  specialize  in  purchasing
portfolio remnants, composed of portfolio firms that have
yet to pay off after many years, but which are still too prom-
ising  to  liquidate.  These  portfolio  remnants  are  called
tailends and their component firms the living dead. Ven-
ture capitalists who specialize in resuscitating (or burying)
the  living  dead  are  analogous  to  vulture  funds  in  public
debt markets or banks’ workout specialists. See the article
by Renee Deger.

As a form of intermediation, two distinctive
features may help explain some of the successes
of the venture capital industry. Unlike most in-
termediated finance in the United States, ven-
ture capital combines the provision of finance
with active governance and control of the firm
by  the  venture  capitalist.  Thus,  entrepreneurs
can finance the development of  new ideas be-
yond the sometimes stifling confines of the large
corporation  but  without  losing  access  to  pro-
fessional management skills and strategic guid-
ance.  These  features  may  increase  the  speed
with which new ideas and products are brought
to market.

The central role of public equity markets is
the  second  distinctive  feature  of  the  venture
capital industry. Success for a venture capital-
ist  is  measured  by  the  number  of  firms  taken
public.  This market test of success reduces in-
trinsic  conflicts  of  interest  between  venture
capitalists  and  their  investors,  although  some
observers  argue  that  the  drive  to  take  firms
public  may  also  promote  a  short-term  bias  in
making investment decisions. The central role
of public equity markets in the venture capital
process reflects the unique depth and sophisti-
cation of U.S. equity markets. Any attempt to
reproduce  the  successes  of  the  U.S.  venture
capital industry must rely on a well-function-
ing capital market or find some functional sub-
stitute.
