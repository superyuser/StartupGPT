How to Get from a Good Idea 
to a Validated Business

Too many entrepreneurs and innovators exe-
cute ideas prematurely because they look 
great in presentations, make excellent sense 
in the spreadsheet, and look irresistible in 
the business plan… only to learn later that 
their vision turned out to be a hallucination.

Systematically applying Customer Development 
and Lean Startup  
This book builds on the seminal work by Steve Blank 
whose Customer Development methodology and the 
concept of “getting out of the building” to test busi-
ness ideas launched the Lean Startup movement and 
Eric Ries who coined the term Lean Startup. 

VIII

Don’t make the mistake  
of executing business ideas 
without evidence: test your 
ideas thoroughly, regardless 
of how great they may seem 
in theory.

Testing is the activity of reducing the risk of pursuing 
ideas that look good in theory, but won’t work in real-
ity. You test ideas by conducting rapid experiments 
that allow you to learn and adapt.  
  This book outlines the most extensive testing 
library on the market to help you make your ideas 
bulletproof with evidence. Test extensively to avoid 
wasting time, energy, and resources on ideas that 
won’t work. 

The entrepreneur’s and 
innovator’s #1 task is to 
reduce risk and uncertainty.

Business Concept Design 

Design is the activity of turning vague ideas, 
market insights, and evidence into concrete  
value propositions and solid business 
models. Good design involves the use of 
strong business model patterns to maximize 
returns and compete beyond product, price, 
and technology. 

The risk is that a business can’t get 
access to key resources (technology, IP, 
brand, etc.), can’t develop capabilities to 
perform key activities, or can’t find key  
partners to build and scale the value  
proposition.

Testing and reducing risk 

To test a big business idea you break 
it down into smaller chunks of testable 
hypotheses. These hypotheses cover three 
types of risk. First, that customers aren’t 
interested in your idea (desirability).  Second, 
that you can’t build and deliver your idea 
(feasibility). Third, that you can’t earn 
enough money from your idea (viability). 
You test your most important hypoth-
eses with appropriate experiments. Each 
experiment generates evidence and insights 
that allow you to learn and decide. Based 
on the evidence and your insights you either 
adapt your idea, if you learn you were  
on the wrong path, or continue testing other 
aspects of your idea, if the evidence  
supports your direction.

Feasibility risk  
We can’t build and deliver

The risk is that a business can’t 
get access to key resources 
(technology, IP, brand, etc.), 
can’t develop capabilities to 
perform key activities, or can’t 
find key partners to build and 
scale the value proposition.

Desirability risk  
Customers aren’t interested

The risk is that the market a 
business is targeting is too 
small; that too few customers 
want the value proposition; or 
that the company can’t reach, 
acquire, and retain targeted 
customers.

XI

Viability risk  
We can’t earn enough money

The risk is that a business can’t 
generate successful revenue 
streams, that customers are 
unwilling to pay (enough), or 
that the costs are too high to 
make a sustainable profit.

Team Design

What kind of team do we need  
to create our business? 

Having worked with teams all around the 
world, we have learned that behind every 
successful new venture is a great team. If 
you are at a startup, the founding team is 
the glue that holds it all together. If you are 
in a corporation, you’ll still need a solid team 
to create a new business venture. If you 
are a solopreneur, the team you eventually 
bring in will make or break your business.

Commonly Required Skills

Cross-Functional Skillset 
A cross-functional team has all the core 
abilities needed to ship the product and 
learn from customers. A common basic 
example of a cross-functional team con-
sists of design, product, and engineering.

Access to Missing Skillsets 
If you do not have all of the skills needed  
or are unable to partner with external  
team members, then evaluate technologi-
cal tools to fill the void.

Testing Tools  
There are new tools coming on to the market 
every day that allow you to:

•  Create landing pages
•  Design logos
•  Run online ads
•  And more... 

All with little or no expertise needed.

Entrepreneurial Experience 
It’s not a coincidence that successful 
businesses benefit from those who already 
have entrepreneurial experience.

Many entrepreneurs needed several 
attempts before finding success. Rovio’s  
hit game, Angry Birds, was preceded by  
six years and 51 failed games.

Diversity 
Team member diversity means they vary 
in aspects such as race, ethnicity, gender, 
age, experience, and thought. Now, more 
than ever, new businesses have real world 
impact on people and society. If the people 
who make up your team all have similar 
life experiences, thoughts, and appear-
ance, then it can make it very difficult to 
navigate uncertainty.

A lack of diverse experiences and perspec-
tives on a team will result in baking your 
biases right into the business. 
  When forming your team, keep diversity 
top of mind, rather than as an afterthought. 
Lead by example, by having a diverse lead-
ership team. The issues that arise from  
having a homogeneous team are very  
difficult to rectify later.

Team  
Behavior 

8

How does our team need to act? 

Team design is necessary, but not sufficient. 
You can have entrepreneurial experience, 
but how you interact with your team needs 
to exhibit entrepreneurial characteristics as 
well. Team behavior can be unpacked into 
six categories that are leading indicators of 
team success.

Successful Teams  
Exhibit Six Behaviors

1. Data Influenced

3. Customer Centric

5. Iterative Approach

You do not have to be data 
driven, but you need to be 
data influenced. Teams no 
longer have the luxury of 
burning down a product back-
log of features. The insights 
generated from data shape 
the backlog and strategy.

To create new businesses 
today, teams have to 
know “the why” behind the 
work. This begins with being 
constantly connected to the 
customer. This should not be 
limited to the new customer 
experience, and expands to 
both inside and outside of the 
product.

2. Experiment Driven

Teams are willing to be wrong 
and experiment. They are not 
only focused on the delivery of 
features, but also craft exper-
iments to learn about their 
riskiest assumptions. Match 
experiments to what you are 
trying to learn over time.

4. Entrepreneurial

Move fast and validate 
things. Teams have a sense of 
urgency and create momen-
tum toward a viable outcome. 
This includes creative  
problem-solving at speed.

Teams aim for a desired result 
by means of a repeated cycle 
of operations. The iterative 
approach assumes you may 
not know the solution, so you 
iterate through different tac-
tics to achieve the outcome.

6. Question Assumptions

Teams have to be willing to 
challenge the status quo and 
business as usual. They aren’t 
afraid to test out a disruptive 
business model that will lead 
to big results, as compared to 
always playing it safe.

Growing the Team 

You can begin this journey without a team, but as 
experiments get more complicated over time, chances 
are you’ll be adding to your team. Expect to grow 
and evolve your team configuration over time, as you 
eventually find product/market fit, build the right way, 
and scale.

DESIGN THE TEAM 
SYNOPSIS 

10

Team  
Environment 

How can you design an environment 
for your team to thrive?

Teams need a supportive environment to 
explore new business opportunities. They 
cannot be held to a standard where failure 
is not an option. Failure will occur, but failure 
isn’t the goal. The goal is to learn faster 
than the competition and put that learning 
into action. Leaders need to intentionally 
design an environment where this can occur, 
otherwise even an ideal team configuration 
with the right behaviors will eventually stall 
out and give up.

The Team Needs to be... 

Dedicated

Funded

Autonomous

Teams need an environment in 
which they can be dedicated 
to the work. Multitasking 
across several projects will 
silently kill any progress. 
Small teams who are dedi-
cated to the work make more 
progress than large teams 
who are not dedicated.

It’s unrealistic to expect 
these teams to function 
without a budget or funding. 
Experiments cost money. 
Incrementally fund the teams 
using a venture-capital style 
approach, based on the 
learnings they share during 
stakeholder reviews.

Teams need to be given  
space to own the work. Do 
not micromanage them to 
the extent where it slows 
down their progress. Instead, 
give them space to give an 
accounting of how they are 
making progress toward the 
goal.

c01.indd   10

2/3/2020   5:49:38 PM

DESIGN 
The Company Needs to Provide...

Support

Access

Direction 

Leadership 
Teams need an environment that has the 
right type of leadership support. A facilita-
tive leadership style is ideal here because 
you do not know the solution. Lead with 
questions, not answers, and be mindful that 
the bottleneck is always at the top of the 
bottle.

Customers 
Teams need access to customers. The trend 
over the years has been to isolate teams 
from the customer, but in order to solve 
customer problems, this can no longer be 
the case. If teams keep getting pushback 
on customer access, they’ll eventually just 
guess and build it anyway. 

Strategy 
Teams need a direction and strategy, or 
it’ll be very difficult to make informed pivot, 
persevere, or kill decisions on the new  
business idea. Without a clear coherent 
strategy, you’ll mistake being busy with 
making progress.

11

Coaching 
Teams need coaching, especially if this is 
their first journey together. Coaches, either 
internal or external, can help guide the 
teams when they are stuck trying to find the 
next experiment to run. Teams that have 
only used interviews and surveys can benefit 
from coaches who’ve seen a wide range of 
experiments.

Resources 
Teams need access to resources in order 
to be successful. Constraints are good, but 
starving a team will not yield results. They 
need enough resources to make progress 
and generate evidence. Resources can be 
physical or digital in nature, depending on 
the new business idea.

Guidance 
Teams need constraints to focus their 
experimentation. Whether it’s an adjacent 
market or creating a new one, to unlock new 
revenue teams need direction on where they 
will play.

KPIs 
Teams need key performance indicators 
(KPIs) to help everyone understand whether 
they are making progress toward a goal. 
Without signposts along the way, it may be 
challenging to know if you should invest in 
the new business.

Team  
Alignment 

How can you ensure your team  
members are aligned? 

Teams often lack a shared goal, context, 
and language when being formed. This 
can be devastating later on, if not resolved 
during the team formation and kickoff. 
  The Team Alignment Map, created by 
Stefano Mastrogiacomo, is a visual tool that 
allows participants to prepare for action: 
hold more productive meetings and struc-
ture the content of their conversations.  
It can help teams have more productive 
kickoffs, with better engagement and 
increased business success.

Each building block illus-
trates essential information 
to be discussed with your 
team. Identifying perception 
gaps early on can prevent 
you from being misaligned 
without even knowing it.

The first phase of the design 
loop is about generating as 
many possibilities and ideas 
as you can. It requires expan-
sive thinking. 

SYNOPSIS 

Business 
Design 

In the design loop you shape and reshape 
your business idea to turn it into the best 
possible value proposition and business 
model. Your first iterations are based on 
your intuition and starting point (product 
idea, technology, market opportunity, etc.). 
Subsequent iterations are based on evi-
dence and insights from the testing loop.

In this first step you try to come up with 
as many alternative ways as possible to 
use your initial intuition or insights from 
testing to turn your idea into a strong 
business. Don’t fall in love with your first 
ideas.  

2. Business Prototype 

In this second step you narrow down the 
alternatives from ideation with business 
prototypes. When you start out you 
might use rough prototypes like napkin 
sketches. Subsequently, use the Value 
Proposition Canvas and Business Model 
Canvas to make your ideas clear and 
tangible. In this book we use these two 
tools to break ideas into smaller testable 
chunks. You will constantly improve your 
business prototypes with insights from 
testing in future iterations. 

3. Assess 

In this last step of the design loop you 
assess the design of your business proto-
types. You ask questions like “Is this the 
best way to address our customers’ jobs, 
pains, and gains?,” or, “Is this the best way 
to monetize our idea?,” or, “Does this best 
take into account what we have learned 
from testing?” Once you are satisfied with 
the design of your business prototypes 
you start testing in the field or go back to 
testing, if you are working on subsequent 
iterations.

The Business 
Model  
Canvas

You don’t have to be a master of the 
Business Model Canvas to use this book, but 
you can use it to shape ideas into a business 
model so you can define, test, and manage 
risk. In this book, we use the Business Model 
Canvas to define the desirability, feasibility, 
and viability of an idea. If you’d like to go 
deeper than the synopsis of the Business 
Model Canvas, we recommend reading 
Business Model Generation or go online to

1.  Identify the Hypotheses 
Underlying Your Idea 
To test a business idea you 
first have to make explicit 
all the risks that your idea 
won’t work. You need to turn 
the assumptions underlying 
your idea into clear hypoth-
eses that you can test. 

2.  Prioritize Most Important 

Hypotheses 
To identify the most import-
ant hypotheses to test 
first, you need to ask two 
questions. First, “What is the 
most important hypothesis 
that needs to be true for my 
idea to work?” Second, “For 
which hypotheses do I lack 
concrete evidence from the 
field?”

c01.indd   29

DEFINITION

Hypothesis

30

The hypothesis has its roots in 
ancient civilization. The English 
word “hypothesis” comes from the 
Greek word hupothesis which means 
“to suppose.” Some even refer to a 
hypothesis as an educated guess. 
Hypotheses are instruments you use 
to prove or refute your assumptions. 

For the purposes of Testing Business Ideas, 
we focus on your business hypothesis,  
which is defined as:

•  an assumption that your value proposition, 

business model, or strategy builds on.
•  what you need to learn about to under-
stand if your business idea might work.

Creating a good business hypothesis

When creating hypotheses you believe to be 
true for your business idea, begin by writing 
the phrase “We believe that…” 

“We believe that millennial parents  
will subscribe to monthly educational  
science projects for their kids.” 

Be mindful that if you create all of your 
hypotheses in the “We believe that…” format, 
you can fall into a confirmation bias trap. 
You’ll be constantly trying to prove what 
you believe, instead of trying to refute it. In 
order to prevent this from occurring create 
a few hypotheses that try to disprove your 
assumptions.  

“We believe that millennial parents won’t 

subscribe to monthly educational science 
projects for their kids.” 
  You can even test these competing 
hypotheses at the same time. This is espe-
cially helpful when team members cannot 
agree on which hypothesis to test.

Characteristics of a good hypothesis

A well-formed business hypothesis describes 
a testable, precise, and discrete thing you 
want to investigate. With that in mind, 
we can continue to refine and unpack our 
hypotheses about the science project  
subscription business.

Testable 
Your hypothesis is testable when it can  
be shown true (validated) or false (invali-
dated), based on evidence (and guided  
by experience).

Precise 
Your hypothesis is precise when you know 
what success looks like. Ideally, it describes 
the precise what, who, and when of your 
assumptions.

Discrete 
Your hypothesis is discrete when it describes 
only one distinct, testable, and precise thing 
you want to investigate.

parents prefer craft 
projects.

 □ We believe millennial par-

ents prefer curated science 
projects that match their 
kids’ education level.

“Do they want this?”

The risk is that the market a

that the company can’t reach, 
acquire, and retain targeted 
customers.

“Should we do this?”

The risk that a business 
cannot generate more 
revenue than costs (revenue 
stream and cost structure).

How to Facilitate 

Core team 

The core team consists of individuals who 
are going to be dedicated to making this 
new business endeavor a success. They 
are cross-functional. This means they have 
product, design, and technology skills 
needed to ship and learn rapidly in the 
market with real customers. At a minimum, 
the core team needs to be present when 
mapping out the assumptions from your 
Business Model Canvas. 

Supporting team 

The supporting team consists of individuals 
who are not necessarily dedicated to the 
business endeavor but who are needed for 
it to be a success. People from legal, safety, 
compliance, marketing, and user research 
will be required for testing assumptions 
where the core team lacks the domain 
knowledge and know-how. 
  Without a strong supporting team, the 
core members may lack evidence and 
make uninformed decisions about what’s 
important.

DEFINITION

Assumptions 
Mapping 

36

A team exercise where desirability, 
viability, and feasibility hypotheses 
are made explicit and prioritized in 
terms of importance and evidence.

Every radically new idea, product, service, 
value proposition, business model, or strat-
egy requires a leap of faith. If proven false, 
these important and yet unproven aspects 
of your idea can make or break your busi-
ness. The Assumptions Mapping exercise is 
designed to help you make all risks explicit 
in the form of hypotheses, so you can  
prioritize them and focus your near-term  
experimentation.

Identify Hypotheses 
Step 1

Use a sticky note to write down each:

•  desirability hypothesis and put it  

on your canvases.

•  feasibility hypothesis and put it  

on your canvases.

•  viability hypothesis and put it  

on your canvases.

Best Practices

•  Use different color sticky notes for 

desirability, feasibility, and viability 
hypotheses.

•  Your hypotheses should be as specific as 
possible, to the best of your knowledge, 
based on what you know today.

•  Every hypothesis should be a single sticky 
note. Don’t use bullet points; that makes it 
easier to prioritize your hypotheses.

•  Keep your hypotheses short and precise. 

No blah blah blah.

•  Discuss and agree as a team when 

writing.

HYPOTHESIZEASSUMPTIONS MAPPING 
Prioritize Hypotheses 
Step 2

Use the Assumptions Map to prioritize all 
your hypotheses in terms of importance and 
existence or absence of evidence that sup-
ports different types of hypotheses.

x-Axis: Evidence 
On the x-axis you place all your hypothe-
ses positioned to show how much evidence 
you have or don’t have to support or refute 
a specific hypothesis. You place a hypoth-
esis on the left if you are able to produce 
relevant, observable, and recent evidence to 
support a hypothesis. You place a hypothe-
sis on the right if you do not have evidence 
and therefore will need to generate it.

y-Axis: Importance 
On the y-axis you place all your hypotheses 
in terms of importance. Position a hypoth-
esis at the top if it is absolutely critical for 
your business idea to succeed. In other 
words, if that hypothesis is proven wrong, 
your business idea will fail and all other 
hypotheses become irrelevant. You place a 
hypothesis at the bottom if it is not one of 
the first things you’d go out and test.

38

Top Left

Share

Check the top left quadrant 
against your evidence and 
share it with the team. Do 
these hypotheses really have 
observable evidence to back 
them up? Challenge the evi-
dence to make sure it’s good 
enough. Keep track of these 
hypotheses in your plan going 
forward. 

Top Right

Experiment

Focus on the top right quad-
rant to identify which hypoth-
eses to test first. This defines 
your near-term experimen-

themes in your business.

1.  Design Experiment

To get started with testing 
your business idea, you 
turn your most important 
hypotheses into experi-
ments. You should start with 
cheap and fast experiments 
to learn quickly. Every 
experiment will reduce the 
risk that you’ll spend time, 
energy, and money on ideas 
that won’t work. 

c01.indd   43

  Children naturally experiment and iterate 
their way through problems. Once they 
begin to progress through traditional school-
ing, experimentation gradually becomes 
less and less of a practice outside of science 
class. The way students are graded, judged, 
and tested means they have to find the sin-
gle right answer. In life, as it is in business, 
there is rarely a single right answer. So over 
time people optimize for being right, instead 
of making progress, because they’re accus-
tomed to being penalized for being wrong. 

It’s no surprise that children raised in this 
style of educational system become adults 
who often struggle with the idea of being 
wrong. The culture of rewarding who is right 
and penalizing who is wrong extends into 
their businesses. They’ve been conditioned 
to look for that one right answer. 
  As you read this book and learn how to 
test your business ideas, you will find there 
is often not one path forward, but many.

  As you experiment, think back to what 
it felt like to be in kindergarten and pre-
school: when you were allowed to try to 
fit the square peg into the round hole. 
Experimentation is about structured creativ-
ity. Tap into that energy within yourself and 
with your teams. 
  For the purposes of Testing Business 
Ideas, the focus is on business experiments, 
which:

•  are procedures to reduce the risk and  

uncertainty of a business idea.

•  produce weak or strong evidence that 

supports or refutes a hypothesis.

•   can be fast/slow and cheap/expensive  

to conduct.

DEFINITION

Experiment 

44

Experiments are the means to 
reduce the risk and uncertainty  
of your business idea.

The experiment is at the core of scientific 
method. Like the hypothesis, it can be 
traced back through history to everything 
from how the vision works with the eye to 
measuring time. 
  What has remained consistent over time 
is that the scientific method is a valuable 
method for generating insights.

What is a good experiment? 
A good experiment is precise enough so that 
team members can replicate it and generate 
usable and comparable data.

•  Defines the “who” precisely (test subject)
•  Defines the “where” precisely (test context)
•  Defines the “what” precisely (test elements)

What are the components of an experiment?  
A well-formed business experiment is made  
up of four components:

1. Hypothesis 

The most critical hypothesis from the top 
right quadrant of your Assumptions Map. 

2. Experiment 

The description of the experiment  
you will run to support or refute  
the hypothesis. 

3. Metrics 

The data you will measure as part  
of the experiment. 

4. Criteria 

The success criteria for your  
experiment metrics.

Call-to-Action Experiment 
A specific type of experiment that prompts 
a test subject to perform an observable 
action. Used in an experiment in order to 
test one or more hypotheses.

EXPERIMENTCreate multiple experiments  
for your hypothesis

We’ve yet to work with a team who created 
just one experiment, had a major break-
through, and then went on to create a 
multibillion dollar business from it. In reality, 
it takes a series of experiments to generate 
the possibility of a successful business. Use 
the Test Cards and the experiment library to 
create well-formed experiments to test your 
business hypotheses.

Experiments Reduce the Risk

As you read through Testing Business Ideas, 
you’ll begin to understand how experiments 
can help you rapidly reduce the risk of 
uncertainty. Instead of building internally for 
long periods in a customer-free zone, you’ll 
learn how to incrementally reduce your risk 
over time. This allows you to build at the 
right time and at the right fidelity.

1.  Analyze the Evidence

Evidence does not speak on 
its own. Gather the evidence 
you have from different 
experiments for a specific 
hypothesis and analyze it. 
Make sure you distinguish 
between strong and weak 
evidence.

2.  Gain Insights

Insights are key learnings 
you get from analyzing 
the data. They allow you 
to support or refute the 
hypotheses you’ve been 
testing. Your insights help 
you understand how likely 
your idea is to work.

The strength of a piece of evidence  
determines how reliably the evidence helps  
support or refute a hypothesis. You can

DEFINITION

Evidence

What is Evidence? 

52

Evidence is what you use to support or 
refute the hypotheses underlying your  
business idea. It is data that you get  
from research or generate from business 
experiments. Evidence can come in many 
different forms, ranging from weak to  
strong evidence. 
  For the purposes of Testing Business 
Ideas, we focus on your business  
experiment evidence which we define as:

•  data generated from an experiment  

or collected in the field.

•  facts that support or refute  

a hypothesis.

•  possibly of different nature (e.g., quotes, 
behaviors, conversion rates, orders,  
purchases…); can be weak/strong.

Opinions (beliefs)  
When people say things like  
“I would…,” “I think _____ is  
important,” “I believe…,” or “I like…”

What people say  
What people say in an interview or 
survey is not necessarily what they 
do in real life or will do in the future.

Lab settings  
When people are aware that you 
are testing something, they may 
behave differently than in a real 
world setting. 

Small investments  
Signing up by email to be  
informed about an upcoming  
product release is a small  
investment and relatively weak 
evidence of interest. 

Facts (events)  
When people say things like  
“Last week I _____ ,” “In that  
situation I usually _____ ,”  
or  “I spent _____ on.” 

What people do  
Observable behavior is generally  
a good predictor of how people  
act and what people might do in 
the future. 

Real world settings  
The most reliable predictor of 
future behavior is what you 
observe people doing when they 
are not aware they are being tested.

Large investments 
Pre-purchasing a product or  
putting one’s professional  
reputation on the line is an  
important investment and  
strong evidence of real interest.

Insights

54

What are insights? 

There is a difference between looking at 
something and looking for something. 
Evidence on its own will not help you reduce 
risk in your business idea; therefore, we  
recommend gleaning insights from the  
evidence your experiments generate. 
  For the purposes of Testing Business 
Ideas, business insights are defined as:

•  what you learn from studying the evidence.
•  learning related to the validity of a 

hypothesis and potential discovery of  
new directions.

•  the foundation to make informed business 

decisions and take action.

to help you determine your 
confidence level:

1. Type and strength of evidence 
Different types of evidence have 
different strengths. A quote from 
an interview is a relatively weak 
indicator of future behavior. A pur-
chase in a simulated sale is a very 
strong indicator of future behav-
ior. The type of evidence you’ve 
collected for a specific hypothesis 
will influence how confident you 
can be about the reliability of your 
insights.  

2. Number of data points  

per experiment 
The more data points you have, the 
better. Five quotes from personal 
customer interviews is obviously 
weaker than 100 quotes. However, 
those same quotes are likely to 
be more accurate than 100 data 
points in an anonymous customer 
survey.

DEFINITION

Confidence 
Level

56

Your confidence level indicates how 
much you believe that your evidence 
is strong enough to support or refute 
a specific hypothesis.

Not all evidence and insights are equal. 
You should be more confident about your 
insights when you’ve run several experi-
ments with increasingly strong evidence 
for a specific hypothesis. For example, you 
might start with interviews to gain some first 
insights into your customers’ jobs, pains, and 
gains. Then you might run a survey to test 
your insights on a larger scale with more 
customers. Finally, you might continue with 
a simulated sale to generate the strongest 
type of evidence for customer interest.

c01.indd   56

2/3/2020   5:51:03 PM

TEST  
Hypothesis Confidence Level
How confident are you that you can support 
or refute a specific hypothesis based on 
experiments, evidence, and insights?

Very Confident 
You can be very confident if you’ve 
run several experiments of which 
at least one is a call-to-action test 
that produced very strong evidence.

Somewhat Confident 
You can be somewhat confident 
if you’ve run several experiments 
that produce strong evidence or a 
particularly strong call-to-action 
experiment.

Not Really Confident 
You need to run more and stronger 
experiments if you’ve only done 
interviews or surveys in which 
people say what they will do. They 
might behave differently in reality.

Not Confident at All 
You need to experiment more if 
you’ve only run one experiment that 
produces weak evidence, such as an 
interview or survey.

57

3. Number and type of  

experiments conducted  
for the same hypothesis 
Your confidence level should rise 
with the number of experiments you 
conduct to test the same hypothe-
sis. Three interview series are bet-
ter than one. Conducting interviews, 
surveys, and simulated sales to 
test the same hypothesis is even 
better. You achieve the best results 
when you conduct experiments with 
increasing strength of evidence, 
and the more you learn.

TEST

1.  Perservere

The decision to continue 
testing an idea based on 
evidence and insights. You 
persevere by further testing 
the same hypothesis with 
a stronger experiment, or 
by moving on to your next 
important hypothesis.

2.  Pivot

The decision to make a 
significant change to one 
or more elements of your 
ideas, value proposition, 
or business model. A pivot 
often means that some 
of your earlier evidence 
may be irrelevant to your 
new trajectory. It usually 
requires retesting elements 
of your business model that 
you’ve already tested.

3.  Kill

The decision to kill an idea 
based on evidence and 
insights. The evidence 
might show that an idea 
won’t work in reality or 
that the profit potential is 
insufficient.

DEFINITION

Decide

Turning insights into action 

Learning faster than everyone else is no 
longer enough. You need to put that learning 
into action, because what you’ve learned 
has an expiration date. If you feel like this is 
happening faster than any time in recorded 
history, you may be correct. People today 
are exposed to more information in a year 
than those in the early 1900s experienced 
in a lifetime. Both markets and technology 
move so quickly that the insights you’ve 
gained can expire within months, weeks,  
or even days. 
  For the purposes of Testing Business 
Ideas, we define action as:

•  next steps to make progress with testing 

and de-risking a business idea.

•  informed decisions based on collected 

insights.

•  decisions to abandon, change, and/or 

continue testing a business idea.

Ceremonies

Ceremonies help us collaborate and 
it is no different for experimentation. 
If your goal is to create a successful 
new business, you’ll need more than 
one experiment to find your way. 
This is why we recommend a series 
of ceremonies to create a repeatable 
process. Each ceremony informs its 
connecting ceremony, creating a 
system.

68

This series of experiment ceremonies is a 
result of years of experience working with 
teams who’ve made business experimenta-
tion a repeatable process. We draw inspi-
ration from agile design thinking and lean 
methodologies.

In this rapidly evolving technical world of work, it’s no longer a 
prerequisite that teams need to sit in the same room to be highly 
effective. Whether you are co-located or distributed, we’ve  
witnessed teams adopt these Experiment Ceremonies to help  
propel their new business ideas.

70

Co-Located Teams 
For Co-Located Teams, we recommend 
having a space that is semiprivate. It can 
be difficult to secure a conference room for 
all of these ceremonies, and it would mean 
bringing your artifacts in every time if they 
are physically printed out. 
  Many teams we’ve coached pick a wall or 
have a pod setup that allows them to quickly 
collaborate and then get back to work.

Distributed Teams 
For Distributed Teams, we strongly recom-
mend video chat whenever possible. It’s 
important to make a connection to your 
team members and be able to see their 
body language. Luckily for you there are 
ample options to choose from in video chat. 
  When reviewing artifacts or conducting 
exercises, try to use software that shows 
people editing and moving things in real 
time. This will prevent confusion and dupli-
cation from attendees.

Weekly Planning 
Plan and task out the experiments for 
the upcoming week. While the plan 
may change, the planning that goes 
into it is still a valuable exercise.

Agenda 
1. Hypotheses to Test 
Identify and revisit the hypotheses you are testing. 
Choose at least one of your important hypotheses to 
test for the upcoming week.

2. Experiment Prioritization 
Once you’ve defined your hypotheses, prioritize the 
experiments you’ll need to run in order to learn about 
the hypotheses. Use our experiment library to identify 
which experiment is best suited for testing desirabil-
ity, viability, and feasibility.

3. Experiment Tasking 
After the experiments have been prioritized, task out 
the top experiments you’ve selected to run for the 
upcoming week. Remember that complex experiments 
take longer and often require sequential tasks.

Agenda 
1. What’s the Daily Goal? 
Create a daily goal. If your goal is to get an experi-
ment out the door, then it’s important to align your 
tasks to achieve that goal. Remember that daily 
goals feed into your larger, more ambitious goals for 
the overall business.

2. How to Achieve That Goal? 
Identify the tasks needed to achieve the daily goal 
and plan your day.

3. What’s in the Way? 
Identify any blockers that would prevent you from 
completing experiment tasks for the day or achiev-
ing the goal. Some of these can be addressed within 
the standup if it is quick, otherwise meet after the 
standup to work through it.

Weekly Learning  
Have a conversation to interpret  
the evidence and turn it into  
action. Remember that what you’ve 
learned from experiments should 
inform your overall strategy.

Agenda 
1. Gather Evidence 
Gather up the evidence your experiments have gener-
ated. This includes both qualitative and quantitative 
types of evidence.

2. Generate Insights 
Look for patterns and insights from your evidence. 
Even qualitative evidence can be quickly themed 
using techniques such as affinity sorting. Try to keep 
an open mind. You may find unexpected insights that 
lead you to new paths to revenue.

3. Revisit Your Strategy 
Take the new insights you have and revisit your 
Business Model Canvas, Value Proposition Canvas, 
and Assumptions Map. Make any updates needed  
so that they reflect your current state of learning.  
This is a crucial step in using what you’ve learned to 
inform your strategy. If it feels awkward, don’t worry, 
it’s a normal part of being an entrepreneur.

Biweekly Retrospective  
Take a step back, breathe, and talk 
about how you can improve the way 
you work. In our opinion, this is the 
most important ceremony. When you 
stop reflecting, you stop learning and 
improving.

Agenda 
1. What’s Going Well 
Take five minutes to silently write down what’s going 
well. This gets the retrospective off to a good start as 
people have space to speak positively about team 
members and how they are working together.

2. What Needs Improvement 
Take five minutes to silently write down what needs 
improvement. These are things that aren’t going well 
or could be doing better. It’s important to frame these 
items as an opportunity to improve, rather than as a 
personal attack against a team member.

3. What to Try Next 
Come up with three things you’d like to try. It can be 
one of the items you’ve previously discussed, or some-
thing completely new. This gives you a chance to try 
out a new way of working that isn’t simply rooted in 
what needs improvement.

Tip 
There are plenty of  
additional retrospective 
options, such as Speed Boat, 
Start — Stop — Keep, and 
Keep — Drop — Add.   
  We recommend trying out  
a few different formats to  
see what works best for you.

TESTCorporate Team 
Core members of the Corporate Team. 
For Corporate Teams, it’s important to detail what 
you can control inside the team and what may be 
outside your sphere of influence in the organization. 
  After the retrospective is completed, have a des-
ignated team member communicate any external 
issues upstream to get help.  

If you cannot get them resolved, try to find creative 

ways to mitigate their impact on the team.

Startup Team 
Core members of the Startup Team. 
For Startup Teams, keep in mind that as you incorpo-
rate improvements into the way you work, it can help 
build the culture you want to create in your startup. 
  Cofounders who exhibit the willingness to inspect 
and adapt how they work will eventually attract 
employees who want to work that way.

Solopreneur 
For Solopreneurs, it can sometimes feel like an isolat-
ing experience. Take the time to reflect on how you 
are working, even if it’s only you during the ceremony.  
If you are unable to achieve the results you are 
aiming for, then it’s a good idea to try new ways of 
working to break through. 

If you are using external contractors then they are 

optional to attend, unless you want to check in with 
them and improve how you are collaborating.

Keep stakeholders in the loop on  
how you are pivoting, persevering,  
or killing the idea.

Agenda 
1. What You’ve Learned 
Provide an executive summary of what you’ve learned 
over the past month. This includes each Weekly 
Learning Goal and any additional insights generated 
from experiments. It’s important not to overwhelm  
the attendees with detailed breakdowns of every 
experiment. Have the information in the appendix to 
dive deeper if needed.

2. What’s Blocking Progress 
This is the time to review any impediments that 
Stakeholders can assist in removing. This includes 
items from previous Retrospectives that fall outside 
your influence or control. These should be clearly 
communicated as requests for assistance.

3. Pivot / Persevere / Kill Decision 
Make your recommendation to Stakeholders on 
whether you should pivot, persevere, or kill the new 
business idea. This should be based not only on what 
you’ve learned, but also what you see as a path  
forward in your strategy.

Tip 
The three major types of 
pivots we witness are based 
on the customer, problem, and 
solution. You can stick with 
the customer, pivot on the 
problem. You can stick with 
the problem and pivot  
on customer. You can stick 
with customer and problem, 
and pivot on the solution.

TESTCorporate Team 
Core members of the Corporate Team and 
Stakeholders. 
For Corporate Teams, continue to communicate the 
progress on what you’ve learned to Stakeholders. 
Walk a balance between showing how you are work-
ing differently and making progress. 

If the Stakeholders take the form of a funding com-
mittee, then decisions will be made during the session 
on whether to fund the effort going forward.

Startup Team 
Core members of the Startup Team and 
Stakeholders. 
For Startup Teams, you want to keep investors in the 
loop on how you are making progress, even if that 
means sharing your struggles. Great investors realize 
it’s not a linear path to a success. Balaji Srinivasan 
affectionally calls this the “Idea Maze.” 
  You can choose to communicate this via an email 
or video update, if your Investors are not physically 
nearby.

Solopreneur 
Solopreneur and an Advisor.  
Get on a video call or have coffee with your advisor  
and share what you’ve learned and what you’re  
recommending. Although your advisor is not likely  
an investor, it’s still helpful to get an outside opinion 
on your strategy.

Principles of  
Experiment 
Flow

82

Running one experiment is great, but the goal 
is to reduce the uncertainty in your business. 
This means running several experiments 
over time. You want your experiment process 
to flow, generating the evidence needed to 
make informed investment decisions.

PRINCIPLE #1 
Visualize Your Experiments 
Make your work visible  
to yourself and others. 

We’ve found inspiration from the lean and 
kanban movements, particularly on this 
principle. If you keep all this work in your 
head, you’ll never be able to achieve flow. 
Not only are your teammates unable to read 
your mind, but much of flow requires you to 
visualize your work.

1. Write down your experiments 

2. Draw a simple experiment board 

3. Add your experiments to the  

We recommend only one experiment  
per sticky, to keep things organized.  
You don’t have to write down hundreds 
of experiments — only the ones you feel 
you’ll be running over the upcoming 
weeks.

This is one of the simplest forms of  
an experiment board you can create.  
We’ve been playing with this format for 
quite some time and used to like the 
“Validate” column, which we got orig-
inally from Eric Ries. Over time, we’ve 
started to back off a bit on that language 
because teams will set the bar so low on 
their hypotheses that they’ll artificially 
validate them and move on too quickly. 
We prefer “Learn” over “Validate.”

Backlog column 
Rank your experiments from top to 
bottom, where the top is the one you are 
going to do next. Pull them across as 
you begin to work on each, moving from 
Setup, to Run, to Learn.

MANAGEPRINCIPLE #2 
Limit Experiments in Progress 
Multitasking too many experiments 
can often lead to trouble.

Teams inherently underestimate how much 
work it is to run experiments, especially if 
they’ve never run them before. So it should 
come as no surprise that they often pull all 
the experiments over at once and try to do 
them all in parallel. This results in slowing 
the entire process down. It’s also difficult to 
extract insights from a previous experiment 
to inform your next one.

Define work in progress limits for  
your experiments. 
For example, start with a limit of 1 for Setup, 
Run, and Learn columns. This will prevent 
the team from pulling a second experiment 
over until the first is moved to the next col-
umn and finally archived. 

In this example, the team runs the cus-
tomer interviews before the survey, instead 
of trying to do both at once (and slowing 
everything down). The experiments flow, 
using what you’ve learned to inform your 
next experiment.

PRINCIPLE #3 
Continuous Experimentation 
Continue to experiment over time.

The last principle, which also finds its roots 
in lean and kanban, is the idea of continuous 
experimentation. A team that starts with the 
previous board to achieve flow will eventu-
ally outgrow it. You don’t want the board to 
artificially constrain the team from growing 
and maturing over time. As we recommend 
in the section on ceremonies (see page 80 
and following), have a retrospective every 
two weeks. This applies to your experiment 
flow, which can yield interesting artifacts for 
improvement.

Blocker Experiment 
As an example, is that the team is trying to 
line up customer interviews, but the research 
department won’t let them. They state that 
it’s against company policy to talk to custom-
ers. That is a “blocker” that’s preventing you 
from making progress on that experiment. 
It’s a good idea to identify and visualize 

these, which will help you communicate 
progress to stakeholders as to why things 
are slowing down. It’s hard to achieve flow 
when you are blocked.

Splitting Columns Experiment 
Another example is that the team has 
outgrown the initial board and is frustrated 
that the Setup column doesn’t capture the 
nuances of experimentation. 
  There is work setting up an experiment, 
but then you have to run it, and if the team 
is at capacity the experiment may sit 
around for a long time waiting to be run. 
When we talk about the board, it would be 
great to see which ones are ready to be run 
and which experiments are still being set up.

Ethics in  
Experimentation

86

Are you experimenting with your customers or on them?  

This book is about helping you determine if your business idea is 
desirable, viable, and feasible. What it is not is a reason to scam peo-
ple out of their money. Vaporware was a term that became popular 
during the late 1980s and much of the 1990s. It described products 
that never launched, but never really canceled either. Vaporware 
products managed to get people hyped up, often promising unreal-
istic expectations. In more severe cases, people even used the lure of 
vaporware to scam people out of real money. Our goal isn’t to recre-
ate the vaporware environment of the 1990s. This is especially import-
ant in the era of fake news, when techniques can be weaponized as 
propaganda to influence entire nations. Context is important when 
using experiments to de-risk your business. In short, don’t be evil.

TESTExperiment 
Guidelines

Poor communication can destroy any exper-
iment cadence you try to create. You can 
address this by clearly communicating the 
details and “the why” behind the experimen-
tation. Teams who’ve done this repeatedly, 
over time, find that they are repeating them-
selves quite a bit. To make things a bit more 
efficient, they’ve crafted experiment guide-
lines to help communicate with those outside 
of the team. This is particularly effective when 
working with legal, safety, and compliance 
departments.

Experiment 
Selection

Experiment Name

Experiment description

Pick the right experiment by asking these 
three questions:

1. Type of hypothesis: What type of 

hypothesis are you testing? 
Pick experiments based on your major 
learning objective. Some experiments 
produce better evidence for desirability, 
some work better for feasibility, and some 
are more appropriate for viability.

— what it’s ideal for

Experiment is not ideal for  
— what it’s not ideal for

2. Level of uncertainty: How much  

evidence do you already have (for  
a specific hypothesis)? 
The less you know, the less you should 
waste time, energy, and money. When 
you know little, your only goal is to 
produce evidence that points you in the 
right direction. Quick and cheap experi-
ments are most appropriate for that goal, 
despite the generally weak evidence. The 
more you know, the stronger the evidence 
should become, which is usually achieved 
by more costly and lengthier experiments.  

3. Urgency: How much time do you have 
until the next major decision point or 
until you run out of money? 
The selection of the right experiment may 
depend on the time and money you have 
available. If you have a major meeting 
with decision makers or investors com-
ing up, you might need to use quick and 
cheap experiments to quickly generate 
evidence on multiple aspects of your idea.  
When you are running out of money, you 
need to pick the right experiments to  
convince decision-makers and investors  
to extend funding.

EXPERIMENTSRules of thumb 

1. Go cheap and fast at the beginning. 

4. Reduce uncertainty as much as you 

Early on, you generally know little. Stick to 
cheap and quick experiments to pinpoint 
the right direction. You can afford starting 
out with weaker evidence, because you 
will test more later. Ideally, you select an 
experiment that is cheap, fast, and still 
produces strong evidence.    

can before you build anything. 
People often think they need to build 
something to start testing an idea. Quite 
the contrary. The higher the costs to build 
something, the more you need to run mul-
tiple experiments to show that customers 
actually have the jobs, pains, and gains 
you think they have.

Our work on experiments in 
the discovery and validation 
phases heavily build on  
Steve Blank’s foundational 
work in “The Four Steps to  
the Epiphany and “The 
Startup Owner’s Manual.”  
We strongly recommend both 
as essential reading.

2. Increase the strength of evidence  
with multiple experiments for the 
same hypothesis. 
Run several experiments to support or 
refute a hypothesis. Try to learn about a 
hypothesis as fast as possible, then run 
more experiments to produce stronger 
evidence for confirmation. Don’t make 
important decisions based on one experi-
ment or weak evidence. 

3. Always pick the experiment that pro-
duces the strongest evidence given 
your constraints.  
Always select and design the strongest 
experiment you can, while respecting 
the context. When uncertainty is high 
you should go fast and cheap, but that 
doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t pro-
duce strong evidence.

Discovery 
Weak evidence is sufficient 
to discover if your general 
direction is right. You get 
first insights into your most 
important hypotheses.

Validation 
Strong evidence is required to 
validate the direction you’ve 
taken. You aim to confirm the 
insights you’ve gotten for your 
most important hypotheses.

B2B Hardware Sequence

B2B Software Sequence

B2B Services Sequence

B2B hardware companies 
search for evidence of 
customers already hacking 
together their own solutions 
to a problem. They use this to 
inform their design to do the 
job even better. Then they test 
it out quickly by integrating 
standard components with 
potential customers and 
crowdfunding it if the signal 
is strong.

B2B software companies 
look for opportunities where 
employees are mandated to 
use subpar software. Many 
have disrupted incumbents 
simply by observing where 
their deficiencies exist and 
then designing a better 
experience that solves for a 
high value customer job, using 
modern technology.

B2B services companies often 
interview stakeholders to 
research the cost of poorly 
designed processes and ser-
vices. They analyze customer 
support data to see if this is 
reflected in other areas within 
the company. Afterward, they 
create a brochure to commu-
nicate the improvement and 
then deliver the service manu-
ally to a handful of customers 
before scaling.

DEFINITION

Experiment
Sequences

Go beyond pairing with 
experimentation sequences.

Once you’ve turned your insights into 
action, it’s time to move on and throw the 
experiment away, correct? Well, not neces-
sarily. As illustrated in the pairings for each 
experiment, there are experiments you 
can run before, during, and after. But what 
about a sequence of experiments? Great 
teams are able to gain momentum and 
build up stronger evidence over time with 
a series of experiments.

B2C Services Sequence

Consumer hardware compa-
nies have more options now 
than ever before. They can 
create Explainer Videos on 
how their new product will 
solve an existing problem, 
then rapidly build using stan-
dard hardware components. 
They can eventually crowd-
fund the build and distribute 
to the customer through retail 
or direct.

The rise of the Internet, open 
source software, and tools 
have catapulted new soft-
ware companies into global 
markets. Smart B2C compa-
nies use the words of their 
customers in their content to 
increase conversions. They 
rapidly prototype experiences 
and even deliver the value 
manually before building the 
product.

B2C services companies 
start in a specific region by 
interviewing customers and 
looking for search volume to 
determine interest. They can 
quickly launch ads that drive 
regional customers to their 
landing page, then follow it 
up with an email campaign. 
Once they’ve conducted a few 
presales, B2C services can 
deliver the value manually to 
refine it before scaling.

B2B2C with B2C 
Experimentation Sequence

B2B2C companies are in a 
unique position to use exper-
imentation to inform the sup-
ply chain. Many companies 
we work with go directly to 
the consumer with their exper-
iments, generate evidence, 
and then use it in negotiations 
with their B2B partners. The 
presence of evidence helps 
provide leverage, instead of 
circular conversations based 
only on opinion.

Highly Regulated Sequence

Contrary to popular belief, 
highly regulated companies 
can also use experimentation. 
They need to do so within 
the constraints of the system 
and be mindful that not all 
testing activities involve a 
catastrophic degree of risk. 
Companies carve out the 
extremely high risk areas they 
are not willing to experi-
ment on and then go after 
the places in which they can 
experiment.

CAPABILITIES  Research

Customer Interviews are ideal for gaining qualitative insights 
into the fit between your value proposition and the customer 
segment. It’s also a good starting point for price testing.

Customer Interviews are not ideal as a substitute for what 
people will do.

DETAILS

Cost 
Cost is relatively low as customers may not 
even need to be compensated. In general, 
remote interviews over video have a lower 
compensation than scheduled in-person 
interviews. B2B interviews are typically more 
expensive than B2C interviews, because the 
sample size is smaller and may have less 
free time.

Evidence Strength 
Customer jobs 
Customer pains 
Customer gains 
80% average accuracy ranking on top-3 
customer jobs, pains, and gains. You want to 
be really dialed into your customer segment, 
so set the bar high.

Setup Time 
Setup time for customer interviews can be 
very short or take a few weeks, depending  
on where your customers are and how 
accessible. You’ll need to create a script,  
find your customers, and schedule the  
interviews. 

Run Time 
Run time for customer interviews is relatively 
short: they only take 15 – 30 minutes each. 
You’ll need to have a 15-minute buffer in 
between each one to recap your findings 
and make any edits you need to the script.

Customer feedback 
Customer jobs, pains, and gains that were 
not originally in your Customer Profile, but 
were offered up by your interviewee.

Interview referrals 
Referrals are an added bonus. It’s a good 
sign if they occur and it’ll save you on acqui-
sition costs for more interviews. 

Customer Interviews are relatively weak 
evidence: it’s only what people say and not 
necessarily what they’ll do. However, they 
are great for qualitative insights to inform 
your value proposition and customer jobs, 
pains, and gains for future testing.

Capabilities 
Research 
While customer interviews can be decep-
tively difficult to do well, the good news 
it that almost anyone can do them with 
practice. It helps if you have a research 
background, but it isn’t required. You’ll need 
to write the script, source candidates,  
conduct the interview, and synthesize 
results. A partner makes this all so much 
easier — otherwise you’ll have to record all  
of the interviews and watch them again.

Requirements 
Target Customer 
Customer Interviews work best when you 
are focused on a narrow target audience. 
Without a customer in mind, you’ll end up 
getting very mixed results and conflicting 
feedback. It takes much longer to interview 
everyone, then back your way into a niche 
customer segment. Instead, we recommend 
you focus on a niche customer segment 
before running any customer interviews.

Writing a Script 
Scripts are a key part of conducting effec-
tive customer interviews, otherwise they 
often turn into conversations that wander 
and rarely extract the learning. You need to 
de-risk your idea. We recommend building 
your script after you’ve created your Value 
Proposition Canvas and ranked the top three 
customer jobs, pains, and gains.

110

DETAILS

Sample Script

1.  Introduction & Context

“Hello, I am [ name ] doing 
research on [ idea ]”

“No pressure to make a 
purchase.”

“Not going to sell you 
anything.” 

2.  Have Them Tell a Story

“When was the last time 
you experienced  
[ pain or job ]?”

“What motivated you  
to do [ action ]?”

“How did you solve it?”

“If not, why?” 

3.  Ranking Customer Jobs, 

Pains, and Gains

List the top three customer 
jobs, pains, and gains.

Interviewee ranks them 
based on personal 
experiences.

“Are there any others you 
expected to be on the list?” 

4.  Thanks & Wrap Up

“What question should  
I have asked you?”

“Can you refer me to  
someone else?”

“May we contact you  
in the future?”

“Thanks!” 

Finding Interviewees 
B2C Segment 
We recommend creating a Value Proposition 
Canvas for your B2C segment and then 
brainstorming where you can find them 
online and offline. Vote as a team where you 
want to focus your search.

B2B Segment 
Same exercise applies to B2B interviewee 
candidates, although it may be harder to 
brainstorm where to find them. Luckily there 
are online and offline locations that, in gen-
eral, work well for finding B2B interviewees.

Screening in-person 
The offline version of this is very similar, 
although you’d simply ask these questions 
in person before diving into the entire inter-
view. If they don’t qualify, thank them for 
their time and move on.

Roles & Responsibilities 
We recommend not doing these on your own 
if at all possible, whether your customer 
interview is online or in person. It’s very diffi-
cult and time-consuming to ask the ques-
tion, actively listen, note body language and 
response, and then ask the next question.  
If you get permission to record the interview, 
it’ll take twice as long because you’ll need to 
watch and listen to it all again. Instead, we 
recommend conducting interviews in pairs.

Scribe

•  Takes notes.

•  Writes exact quotes 

when possible without 
paraphrasing.

•  Describes body language. 

Interviewer

•  Asks questions from script.

•  Delves deeper when needed 

by asking why.

•  Thanks and wrap up.

Interviewee

•  Answers questions.

Vetting Interviewees 
Vetting interview candidates isn’t fail-safe, 
but overall it’ll save you time by screening 
out those who do not qualify for the inter-
view process. One or two less-than-ideal 
candidates will always slip through, but  
it’s still better than not qualifying people at 
all. One way to do so is a simple screener 
survey to qualify people before scheduling 
anything.

Screening on Craigslist 
Craigslist is a popular website for posting 
things to buy and sell, but it’s also a gold 
mine for finding customers to interview. 
Simply go to the Community -> Volunteers 
section of Craigslist and post your research 
request. In the description, include a survey 
link for those who are interested in partici-
pating. The survey should include qualifying 
and disqualifying questions.  
  For example, if you are looking for people 
who own a bicycle, ask: “How many bicycles 
do you own — 0, 1, 2, or 3+?” 

If people answer 0, then it saves you from 
interviewing those who do not own a bicycle. 
If people answer 3+, they also might not be 
ideal candidates because they own so many 
bicycles. Simple screener questions like this 
will save you and your interviewees hours.

c01.indd   111

2/3/2020   5:51:48 PM

 
 
 
15-Minute Debrief 
Immediately after each interview is con-
cluded, take 15 minutes to debrief with your 
partner to quickly recap what you learned 
and if anything needs to be revised.

Debrief Topics
•  What went well with that interview?
•  What did we learn from body language?
•  Did we bias the candidate in any way?
•  Is there anything we want to quickly revise 

in the script?

112

DETAILS

Synthesizing Feedback 
In addition to the 15-minute debrief, the 
team should synthesize their notes and 
update the Value Proposition Canvas to help 
inform your strategy. One quick way to sort 
through a lot of qualitative feedback is a 
technique called Affinity Sorting.

Affinity Sorting 
As a team, set aside 30 – 60 minutes and 
bring your notes.

•  Make sure there is plenty of wall space  

if meeting in person.

•  Write one quote per sticky note.
•  Write one insight per sticky note.
•  Place the interviewee name or initials 

 on the bottom of the sticky note.

•  Place all stickies on the wall.
•  Sort them into similar themes.

Updating Your Canvas 
After you’ve synthesized the qualitative 
feedback and analyzed rankings from your 
first batch of customer interviews, go back 
to your Value Proposition Canvas and make 
any edits needed. It’s important that your 
testing inform your strategy.

Ranking Analysis 
Ranking isn’t a perfect science, but it’ll give 
you a sense of how close you are to the 
ranking in your Customer Profile. The draw-
back of having interviewees rank is that on 
its own, you don’t know how much they feel 
the job, pain, or gain, relatively, compared 
to others. This is why it’s important to ask 
follow-up questions and pick up on body 
language. 

If you’ve interviewed 10 customers that 
match your Customer Profile, then ideally 
you want the customer jobs, pains, and 
gains ranking from your Customer Profile to 
be at the 80%+ accuracy rate. Which means 
8 out of 10 ranked job 1 as #1, job 2 as #2, 
job 3 as #3, and so on.

 □ Ask for permission before 

recording.

 □ Qualify the candidate so 

that you don’t waste each 
other’s time.

 □ Adopt a beginner’s mind.

 □ Listen more than you talk.

 □ Get facts, not opinions.

 □ Ask “why” to get real 

motivations.

 □ Ask for permission to follow 

up.

 □ Ask for referrals to 

interview.

 □ Ask if there is anything you 
should have asked, but 
didn’t. 

 – Talk more than you listen.

 – Pitch the solution.

 – Be thinking of the next 

question to ask, instead 
of actively listening to the 
response.

 – Nod your head yes or no 
while the interviewee is 
speaking.

 – Ask only closed ended 

questions.

 – Schedule the interviews 

back to back, without any 
time in between to debrief.

 – Forget to update your 

Value Proposition Canvas 
with your findings.

Run Time 
Run time for A Day in the Life is a bit longer 
than other methods, in that you need to 
spend several hours each day observing 
customer behavior. This can extend over 
several days or weeks at a time, depending 
on the number of participants.

Customer quotes 
Take note of additional quotes from the 
customers that are not limited to jobs, pains, 
and gains. 
  Customer quotes are relatively weak, but 
helpful for context and qualitative insights 
for upcoming experiments.

Capabilities 
Research 
Almost anyone can use A Day in the Life. 
It will help if you have research abilities so 
that you can collect and document the data 
properly. It’s recommended that you have  
a partner when doing so to compare notes.

Requirements 
Consent 
A Day in the Life ideally requires consent  
from those you are observing. It also 
requires you to coordinate with manage-
ment and security at the locations in which 
you observe. For example, if you are going 
to hang out at a retail store and observe 
patterns, then speak to the manager first  
to get permission. If you wish to observe 
someone who made a purchase, ask them 
for permission before doing so. Otherwise 
this can become creepy and you may be 
escorted out by security.

A DAY IN THE LIFE
Closing the Say/Do Gap
Intuit’s Follow-Me-Home Program

Intuit creates financial, accounting, 

and tax preparation solutions for 
small businesses, accountants, and 
individuals, such as TurboTax, Quick-
Books, and Mint.com. Intuit is located 
in the heart of Silicon Valley (Moun-
tain View, California) and is well 
known for pushing the boundaries of 
customer-centric problem solving.

CASE STUDY

Can you give us a brief explanation of 
the Follow-Me-Home Program at Intuit?
The Follow-Me-Home is one technique from 
Intuit’s “Design for Delight” program, that 
teaches our employees the skills required to 
create awesome products for our customers. 
Design for Delight includes three core prin-
ciples: Deep Customer Empathy, Go Broad 
to Go Narrow, and Rapid Experimentation 
with Customers. The Follow-Me-Home is the 
most powerful technique from the Design for 
Delight principle, Deep Customer Empathy. 
There is nothing more effective than observ-
ing a customer when and where they are 
actually experiencing the pain and problems 
we are trying to solve.
  We teach the Follow-Me-Home tech-
nique to each and every employee in the 
company, and each new person who joins 
Intuit learns the technique as part of their 
onboarding process. In fact, each new hire 
conducts at least two Follow-Me-Homes 
within the first few weeks of starting their 
career at Intuit, regardless of their function 
or level of seniority. From new engineers, 
to seasoned HR personnel, to product 
managers, to our most senior leaders, 
everyone is expected to learn how do to a 
Follow-Me-Home.

How did it get started?
Intuit’s founder, Scott Cook, was inspired 
by a similar technique used by Toyota. 
In the early days of Intuit, Scott suspected 
he could use this technique to improve 

Intuit's products, and so he began testing 
the Follow-Me-Home approach while 
building our early products such as Quicken 
and QuickBooks. In those days software 
was installed on a physical computer via 
floppy discs (sounds crazy), so Scott and our 
product teams asked real customers if they 
could watch them install the software after 
it was purchased.
  Through observation, product teams 
uncovered new insights, and complete sur-
prises about how customers actually used 
our software in the real world. These insights 
often led to product improvements, so the 
Follow-Me-Home principles were codified, 
then shared with our employees. The Follow-
Me-Home technique continues to evolve 
with the times, but the spirit remains the 
same — go observe customers where they 
are experiencing the pain or problems about 
which you need to learn.

What’s your role in the program?
My team reports to Diego Rodriguez, Intuit’s 
Chief Product and Design Officer. Our mis-
sion is to nurture Intuit’s culture of innova-
tion, through programs such as Design for 
Delight, our network of expert Innovation 
Catalyst Coaches, and high-impact train-
ing. Our job is to ensure each and every 
employee has the opportunity to learn and 
apply the most effective innovations skills to 
their daily work, such as Follow-Me-Homes, 
and we continuously improve these skills as 
the world changes.

c01.indd   120

2/3/2020   5:51:55 PM

  We also know that not everyone is 
comfortable “getting outside the building” 
to speak with people who are complete 
strangers. It does take a bit of courage to go 
try a Follow-Me-Home the first few times, so 
getting people over their initial reluctance is 
something we focus on, as well as encour-
aging them to practice often. The good news 
is that the vast majority of people tell us 
Follow-Me-Homes are transformative, and 
they often begin doing Follow-Me-Homes on 
their own. They end up loving the technique.  

How do you see programs like this evolving 
in the future? 
We’ve already improved our approach to 
Follow-Me-Homes over the years, and we’ll 
continue to do so as the world around us 
evolves. For example, Intuit has an increas-
ing number of customers all over the world. 
We’ve adapted the Follow-Me-Home so we 
can conduct them remotely, using video 
camera and screen share technology. We’ve 
also tweaked the approach to ensure we 
respect the cultures and traditions of the 
locations we visit. As the world continues to 
get flatter, and technology changes, we’ll 
continue to adapt our approach. However, 
the spirit remains the same. Go observe for 
yourself.

What advice would you give readers who’d 
like to try this at their organization? 
The simple answer is to just try it. Start small, 
trying it yourself on a few projects so you can 
learn what works and what does not work in 
the context of your organization. Then you 
build on what you learned to scale a formal 
program, or just continue using the technique 
yourself. You just might become the most 
effective person in your organization. 
  People who read this book are familiar 
with innovation best practices, so I simply 
suggest you apply these best practices 
to your future Follow-Me-Home program 
as if it is a “new product.” Remember that 
Follow-Me-Homes are just one of the many 
skills required to be an effective innovator, 
so Follow-Me-Homes won’t make you suc-
cessful in a vacuum. You will likely need to 
develop supporting programs, and a culture 
which embraces these types of techniques. 
The good news is Follow-Me-Homes and the 
related skills are extremely fast to execute, 
flexible, and much cheaper than a failed 
product launch. Get out there and try it.

  We partner with other organizations such 
as HR, Learning and Development, and 
functional communities to achieve this goal, 
but our team’s specialty is ensuring Intuit’s 
innovation flame always burns bright. I work 
with an amazing team who are all dedicated 
to this goal, so my job is to simply continue 
learning and improving as a team. There are 
always ways we can get better.

What do you find most challenging about 
training employees in this technique? 
Techniques like Follow-Me-Home can be 
learned by anyone, but just like any new 
skill, it takes consistent practice to master. 
In the early stages of learning people often 
misunderstand the details of how to execute 
a Follow-Me-Home, and it takes time for 
best practice to become second nature. 
  For example, one VERY important aspect 
of a great Follow-Me-Home is the focus 
on observation, versus traditional inter-
viewing — i.e., talking. We teach people to 
focus first on what they observe a customer 
actually doing in a real situation, using their 
real tools, rather than overly scripting a 
simulation, or asking questions. Once obser-
vation is complete, only then should you 
ask interview-like questions, and when you 
ask questions focus on the “why” behind the 
observed behaviors, not speculation or opin-
ions. When people first learn how to conduct 
a Follow-Me-Home, they typically ask way 
too many questions, and do not focus on 
simply observing the behaviors in question. 
That’s just one example.

 □ Identify your target  

audience for the survey.

 □ Assuming a 10–20% 

response rate and calculate 
how many people should 
receive the survey.

 □ Set a start and stop date 

for the survey.

 □ Create your survey.

ter responses into themes. 
Don’t label before you sort; 
allow the labels to emerge 
from the sorting.

 □ Use word clouds or a text 

analyzer to quickly visualize 
which words and phrases 
customers use most 
frequently.

 □ Review the themes and 

quotes with your team and

Cost 
Discovery surveys are not very expensive 
and there are several free and low-cost 
services that you can use to send them to 
your customers. Much of the cost comes 
from reaching the target audience. It gets 
more expensive if you are targeting profes-
sionals or are in the B2B space. Your sample 
size gets smaller; therefore you may end 
up spending time and money to reach your 
audience.

Setup Time 
Discovery surveys do not take very long to 
set up and configure. Many of the questions 
are open-ended. It should only take a few 
hours to a day at most. 

124

Run Time 
Much of the run time on a discovery survey 
depends on the size of your customer pool 
and how easy it is to reach them. It shouldn’t 
take more than a few days, but could take 
longer if you aren’t able to get enough 
results.

DETAILS

Evidence Strength

# of free text answer responses 
Insights 
Look for repeating patterns in the responses 
to the survey. By the fifth survey response 
with a similar target customer, you should 
start seeing the same thing written in differ-
ent ways.

# people willing to be contacted after  
the survey 
Valid Emails 
Ideally you have a small percentage, around 
10%, who want to be contacted in the future.

Capabilities 
Product / Marketing / Research 
Discovery surveys require the ability to write 
open-ended survey questions without  
a negative tone. You’ll also need to be able 
to identify the audience and interpret the 
results by Affinity Sorting or using word 
clouds to find patterns in the feedback.

Requirements 
Qualitative Source Material 
Surveys are generally more impactful when 
you already have qualitative insights from 
other methods that don’t scale. Use that 
material to inform your survey design.

Access to an Audience 
Getting in front of the right audience is just 
as important as your survey design. If you 
have an existing site with lots of traffic, 
then you can leverage that to get to your 
audience. If you do not have this luxury or 
are going after a new market, then brain-
storm channels to use before designing your 
survey.

Capabilities 
Marketing / Research / Data 
Search Trend Analysis can be performed 
by almost anyone who is willing to learn 
online trend analysis tools. Most of them, 
such as Google Trends and Google Keyword 
Planner, will have contextual help to walk 
you through the process. You’ll still need to 
be able to interpret the results, so having a 
marketing, research, and data background 
will be beneficial.

Requirements 
Online Customers 
Search Trend Analysis can be a powerful 
way to uncover customer jobs, pains, gains, 
and even their willingness to pay for a solu-
tion. However, they must have performed 
searches online to generate this evidence. 
If you are targeting a niche, B2B, or mainly 
offline customer, your searches are not 
going to return any significant volume.

Cost 
The cost of performing web traffic analysis 
is relatively cheap, especially if you use a 
free tool like Google Analytics. If you require 
more in-depth, event-level tracking and 
want to pay for a tool, they can vary widely 
in cost. Some start out very cheap, but as 
your customer traffic scales the cost can 
increase with it. If you are looking for heat 
map analysis of how people use the pages, 
there are low-cost options for that as well.

132

Setup Time 
Setup time to perform web traffic analysis 
is relatively short, from a few hours to a few 
days. You’ll need to integrate the tool into 
your website and log into the dashboard to 
view the data. Depending on the tool, it may 
take a day or more for the data to appear. 

Run Time 
Run time to perform web traffic analysis is 
unfortunately rather long, typically from 
weeks to months. It largely depends on the 
amount of traffic you have, but essentially 
you don’t want to make large risky decisions 
based on a few days’ worth of data.

DETAILS

Evidence Strength

# of sessions 
Number of interactions with your website 
within a given time frame, for a specific user. 
Usually within a 30-minute period.

# of drop-offs 
Drop-offs occur when a user drops out of the 
flow you’ve defined. You’ll want to analyze 
the percent of drop-offs at which step and 
whether they left the site entirely. 
  How many customers you have on the site 
and where they are dropping off is relatively 
strong evidence, as it is measuring what 
they do. You don’t know why they are doing 
it until you ask them.

Amount of attention 
Attention can be a number of different user 
actions, usually including time spent on 
page and where they clicked. Users don’t 
always click on buttons and links, so hav-
ing heat map data can give you amazing 
insights into how you are gaining or losing 
attention in your site. 
  Attention is also relatively strong evi-
dence, and yet, like session and drop-offs, it 
only tells you the “what” and not the “why.”

Capabilities 
Technology / Data 
The learning curve on web traffic analysis 
can get steep rather quickly, especially once 
you go beyond the basics of user behavior. 
We suggest having the technical capability 
to integrate the analytics software and the 
data awareness of being able to analyze 
the results. For example, the heat map data 
will show you where people clicked, but 
you’ll want to slice that data by source to 
see if people coming from online ads click 
differently than those who come from an 
email campaign.

Requirements 
Traffic 
Web traffic analysis requires an existing 
website with active users, otherwise you 
won’t be able to collect any evidence. 
Similar to the simple landing page, we rec-
ommend driving traffic to your site using:

•  Online ads
•  Social media campaigns
•  Email campaigns
•  Word of mouth
•  Discussion forums

 □ Search for phrases related 

to your questions on discus-
sion forums.

 □ Take screenshots and 
export your results.

 □ Write down notes about 

sense of urgency and tone 
in the forum threads.

Analyze

 □ Update your Value 

Proposition Canvas based 
on your findings.

 □ Contact the forum posters 

in direct messages to learn 
if they’ll speak to you in 
more detail.

 □ If yes, then run experiments 
with them to help close the 
gap.

Prepare

 □ Identify what discussion 

forums you want to use for 
your analysis (internal vs. 
external).

 □  Define the questions you 
want to answer such as,  
is there evidence that:

• you are not solving for  

top customer jobs?

• you are not addressing 
major customer pains?

• you are not creating  

customer gains?

• customers are creating 
their own work-around 
solutions to address your 
product deficiencies?

DETAILS

Evidence Strength

Types of work-arounds 
Look for a pattern of work-arounds or ways 
to hack the product to get it to do what 
people need. This can provide insights into 
improvements. 
  Similar to Steve Blank’s “built a solution 
to solve the problem,” it’s strong evidence if 
people are hacking together their own meth-
ods to solve problems the product doesn’t 
fully address.

Types of feature requests 
Look for a pattern in the top three features 
requested on the discussion forums and 
what pains and underlying jobs they could 
solve. 
  Feature requests are relatively weak 
evidence, in that you’ll need to perform more 
experiments around the underlying job or 
pain the proposed feature is intended to 
solve.

Capabilities 
Research / Data 
You’ll need to be able to identify discussion 
forums, gather data, and analyze it. In doing 
so, it’ll help to be able to understand how to 
scrape online websites and what questions 
you’ll want to answer from looking through 
the data. It’ll help if you have data and 
research capabilities when doing so.

Requirements 
Discussion Forum Data 
The most important requirement for analyz-
ing discussion forum data is having existing 
discussion forums to analyze the questions 
you need to answer. If you feel there are 
unmet needs in a competitor’s product, go to 
community and support forums where their 
customers post topics. If you have your own 
discussion forums, they should also be a 
great source of data. 

Cost 
Cost is relatively cheap, since you are basi-
cally analyzing online discussion forums to 
find unmet needs. If it’s your own discussion 
forum, this should be relatively cost effective 
and analytics may even be already built  
into your software. If you are analyzing a 
competitor’s or other community discussion 
boards, you’ll likely be web scraping them 
with low-cost tools or just doing it manually 
yourself. You’ll save on the cost by manually 
doing so but it might take much longer.

136

Setup Time 
Setup time to analyze discussion forums is 
relatively short. It’ll require you to define the 
questions you want to answer and identify 
which discussion forums to analyze. 

Run Time 
Run time for analyzing discussion forums is 
also relatively short. It takes a bit longer if 
you decide not to use a web scraping tool, 
so we’d recommend automating it if possible 
to shorten run time. You’ll want to look for 
patterns of unmet customer jobs, pains, and 
gains.

usable way from your existing sales force. 
The analysis of the sale force feedback data 
can be done without expensive software or

# of near misses 
Near miss feedback 
When your sales group has successfully 
closed, what almost prevented the sale from 
occurring? You’ll want to log how many sales 
were almost lost and what customers had 
to say about what “almost prevented them 
from purchasing” to better understand fit. 
  Customer feedback on why they almost 
didn’t purchase, but ultimately did, is a gold 
mine of relatively strong evidence. It’s stron-
ger than most feedback because they’ve 
just converted. 

Types of feature requests 
Look for a pattern in the top three features 
requested in the sales process and what 
pains and underlying jobs they could solve. 
  Feature requests are relatively weak 
evidence, in that you’ll need to perform more 
experiments around the underlying job or

its own, but can be used to inform future 
experiments.

Types of feature requests 
Look for a pattern in the top three features

Customer Support Data 
The most important requirement for  
customer support analysis is already having 
customer support data to analyze. This can 
be in many forms, whether it is recorded 
calls from your support team to emails or 
bug/feature requests submitted. The data 
you analyze should consist of more than 
one-off, anecdotal conversations with a 
handful of customers.

Finding Target Customers 
Finding target customers online can be chal-
lenging, but it is possible with creativity and 
resilience. You can start thinking about this 
early, even before your experiment design. 
  For example, when creating your Value 
Proposition Canvas, take time to brainstorm 
different places to find your target custom-
ers online. Then as a team, vote on the ones 
you’d like to test first.

What Stage Are Your Customers? 
After prioritizing places to find your target 
customers, you’ll want to customize your 
approach based on the state of the cus-
tomer. You can use Steve Blank’s model to 
help inform your strategy for engaging with 
customers.

OVERVIEW

Aware

Have the problem

This tool was inspired by Steve Blank’s Earlyvangelist Characteristics  
in Chapter 3 of The Four Steps to the Epiphany, page 47, figure 3.1.

Push-Based Approach 
With customers who have the problem and are aware 
of it, you can use a push-based approach to getting 
them into your experiments. Leverage advertising to 
create targeted ads for them. With display advertis-
ing you can segment people into interests and “push” 
your experiment to them.

SOCIAL MEDIA AD 
Prepare

 □ Define on which social 

media platforms you’ll run 
the ad.

 □ Create your target audience,  
ad campaign length, and 
budget.

 □ Choose CPC (cost per click) 

option.

 □ Include your business name 

and logo.

 □ Craft a value statement 

from your Value Proposition 
Canvas to properly commu-
nicate your offering.

 □ Create a compelling image 
that reinforces your value 
statement.

 □ Include the destination URL 
that directs to a landing.

Execute

 □ Once approved, run your 

social media ad.

 □ Monitor how it performs 

daily with:

• ad spend.

• impressions.

• click through rate.

• comments and shares.

Analyze

 □ Analyze your ad perfor-

mance daily.

 □ If you are spending a large 
amount of money for a 
very low click through 
rate, pause the campaign, 
iterate on your text and 
images, then run the cam-
paign again.

in Chapter 3 of The Four Steps to the Epiphany, page 47, figure 3.1.

Pull-Based Approach 
In contrast to push-based acquisition, you can take a 
slightly different approach for those already seeking 
a solution to the problem. You will need to get in front 
of them when they are seeking it. 
  Pull-based acquisition means ensuring your exper-
iment is displayed when people go online to search 
for a solution to their problems. Using online search 
advertising you can narrow in on the key search terms 
and “pull” them to your value proposition as they 
actively seek a solution.

Cost 
Online ads can vary in cost, depending 
on whether you are doing display versus 
search, the keywords, and the average 
cost per click for your industry. Overall 
you should stay away from very expensive 
online ads early on in your journey. You don’t 
want to get addicted to paid acquisition and 
have trouble scaling your business later on.

Setup Time 
If your ad is text only, you can create it in 
a few minutes. If your ad contains imagery, 
it might take longer to find and create the 
right image for the ad. 

150

Run Time 
Depending on the platform, it may take 
1 – 3 days for your ad to be approved. Once 
it’s approved, you’ll usually run your ad 
for at least a week to see how it performs 
day-to-day.

DETAILS

Evidence Strength 
# of unique views 
# of clicks 
Click through rate = clicks that your ad 
receives divided by the number of times 
your ad is shown. CTR varies per industry, so 
research online to see what a comparable 
CTR is for your product. 
  Users clicking ads is a relatively weak 
strength of evidence, but it it necessary 
to test acquisition channels. It can also 
be combined with conversions on a simple 
landing page to make the evidence stronger 
overall.

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Marketing 
Running online ads is much easier than it 
used to be, mostly because online ad plat-
forms give you a step-by-step experience for 
managing them. You’ll still need to be able 
to design an ad that conveys your value 
proposition well, with the right call to action 
and target audience. This means you’ll need 
product, marketing, and design skills —  
otherwise your ads will not convert.

Requirements 
Destination 
You are going to need a destination for the 
target audience to visit once they click the 
ad. Most of the time this is some type of 
landing page. Platforms have become more 
restrictive over the years, so the page will 
need to match the overall value proposition 
of the ad and meet the site’s ad destination 
requirements. Be sure to review these before 
running your ads, otherwise they’ll get 
rejected in the approval process.

DETAILS

Cost 
Link tracking is relatively cheap. Most online 
web analytics, online ad, and email software 
provide the ability to track unique URL links. 

Setup Time 
The setup time for link tracking is relatively 
short if you use existing software. You’ll need 
to create the links for your different digital 
media formats. 

Evidence Strength 
# of unique views 
Click rate = percentage of people who 
viewed your link divided by the number of 
people who clicked on your link. 
  Click rates vary by industry. Use industry 
guidelines to determine what the average is 
for your experiment. 
  Link clicks are an average strength of 
evidence. You’ll learn what they do, but you 
won’t know why unless you talk to them.

Run Time 
The run time for link tracking is usually over 
a few weeks. It’ll take time for people to view 
it and decide to click, or not.

154

Capabilities 
Technology / Data 
Link tracking doesn’t require deep expertise, 
as most software already has it included. 
You’ll need to be able to create links with 
tracking and interpret the results.

Requirements 
Call to Action 
Link tracking isn’t going to be very success-
ful without a clear call to action and value 
proposition. You’ll want to clearly communi-
cate this in your content and imagery, while 
providing a link that brings the customer to 
a web page.

Prepare

 □ Decide where you are going 
to include the Feature Stub: 
preferably in the part of 
your product where your 
customers would need it 
most in the workflow.

 □  Define the length and 

schedule for the Feature 
Stub.

 □ Create the Feature Stub, 
using the same visual 
styling as the rest of the 
product.

 □ When clicked, launch a 

popup that states the fea-
ture isn’t completed yet.

 □ Include a “learn more” link 
to determine if people are 
interested enough to click 
again. Optionally, it can 
display a survey that asks 
how interested and has an 
email signup.

 □ Integrate analytics to track 

views and clicks.

 □ Implement a feature toggle 
that allows you to quickly 
turn it on and off. This is a 
very important step!

Execute

Analyze

 □ Toggle your Feature Stub on.

 □ Monitor the activity usage 
of the link very closely, by 
the hour.

 □ Toggle the Feature Stub off 
once you’ve reached the 
end of the schedule.

 □ Calculate conversion rates 
on your button, learn more, 
and surveys. Did these 
reach your success criteria?

 □ Review the findings with 
your team to determine 
whether the feature is still 
worth pursuing.

DETAILS

Cost 
Feature Stubs are usually very cheap, since 
you are not building out an entire feature 
but merely the entry point for it.

Setup Time 
It should only take few hours to set up a 
Feature Stub in your existing product or 
service. If it takes longer than that, you may 
need to rethink your architecture when it 
comes to implementing experiments. 

Evidence Strength 
# of unique views 
# of button clicks 
Button % Conversion Rates 
You can calculate the conversion rate by 
taking the number of unique views divided 
by button clicks = conversion rate. Aim for  
a 15% conversion on button click. 
  Button views and clicks are relatively 
weak evidence, although they do signal 
interest in the feature.

158

Run Time 
Feature Stubs should never be run for more 
than 1– 3 days. They are designed as a short 
experiment  to quickly gather evidence.  
  Anything longer will frustrate your cus-
tomers, since they’ll continue to expect it to 
work.

# of “learn more” clicks 
Learn More % Conversion Rates 
You can calculate the conversion rate by 
taking the number of unique “learn more” 
views divided by link clicks = conversion rate. 
Aim for a 5% conversion on learn more click. 
  Clicking to learn more is a bit stronger 
than simply closing the popup. 

# of surveys completed 
Survey Feedback 
You can calculate the conversion rate by 
taking the number of unique learn more 
clicks divided by completions = conversion 
rate. Aim for a 3% conversion on survey 
completion. 
  Filling out the survey from the learn more 
link is a bit stronger than closing the popup. 
You can learn valuable insights from people 
voluntarily clicking on and filling out  
a survey on a feature they'd love to see in 
the product.

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Technology 
You’ll need to be able design a button that 
fits into the existing product. You’ll also 
need the button to launch a window stating 
that the feature isn’t ready yet and option-
ally asks the customer to fill out a survey. 
Analytics will be important — you’ll need to 
measure its performance.

Requirements 
Existing Product 
Feature Stubs require a product that 
already has daily active users. If you don’t 
already have one with a steady stream of 
users, it will be difficult to gauge customer 
interest. They have to see it in the context  
of the product for the evidence to be 
believable.

Integration and Analytics 
Feature Stubs need to be toggled off and 
on at a moment’s notice. Make sure you 
have this capability and that it works before 
launching one. In addition, you’ll need ana-
lytics to measure feature interest.

VARIATION

404

160

DISCOVERY / INTEREST DISCOVERY

404 Test

Another faster, and somewhat riskier, variation of a Feature Stub  
is the 404 test. It is very similar, except you do not put anything 
behind the button or link whatsoever. Hence, the 404 test name, as  
it generates 404 errors each time it is clicked. To learn if a feature  
is desirable, you simply count the number of 404 errors generated. 

This variant has trade-offs 
since, on one hand, you can 
test something as quickly  
as possible at scale with  
customers. On the other hand, 
it gives the impression that 
your product is broken. 

When running a 404 test,  
do not run it for more than  
a few hours.

404 Test

The notion of doing a quick test,

— Stephen Kaufer, CEO of TripAdvisor

Endless Meetings 
Have you ever been in a meeting where 
team members debated over whether a  
feature would be a good idea to build for 
your customers? 
  Without evidence, the conversation goes 
in circles, using only opinions for decision- 
making. 
  A Feature Stub will generate data to help 
you gauge demand. 
  What if the test is a wild success and cus-
tomers reach out to you asking when they 
can use the feature? It then helps break the 
circular meetings of opinion on the feature. 
  What if the test is a dud and no one even 
clicks on it? Then it also helps move the  
conversation forward. 

It’s not so much about being right and 
able to gloat in the meeting to your peers 
that your prediction was correct, but instead 
to use data to help move the conversation 
forward. Making progress is far more import-
ant than being correct in these scenarios, 
and a Feature Stub is a great way to make 
progress.

DETAILS

Cost 
Email campaigns are relatively cheap: there 
are several services that make it cost effec-
tive to manage the creation, distribution, 
and analysis of emails across large numbers 
of subscribers.

Evidence Strength 
Opens 
Clicks 
Bounces 
Unsubscribes 
Open rate = unique clicks divided by the 
number of unique opens. 

Setup Time 
Using today’s email tools, it only takes 
minutes to a few hours to craft an email 
campaign. You can create auto-drip emails 
to send on a schedule over time without 
manually having to intervene. 

164

Run Time 
Depending on the nature of the email cam-
paign, it can take 1 – 2 days or 3 – 4 weeks. 

Click rate = percentage of people 
who clicked on at least one link in 
your email message. 

Open and click rates vary by industry. Use 
industry guidelines to determine what the 
average is for your experiment. They can be 
found in most email service tools as part of 
the reports package. 
  Email opens and clicks are an average 
strength of evidence.

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Marketing 
Email campaigns are relatively easy to create  
and manage now that many dedicated tools 
and services exist. You’ll still need to be able 
to write clear, coherent copy with compelling 
images and a strong call to action. Much 
of the formatting can be taken care of by 
online templates.

Requirements 
Subscriber List 
Email campaigns require subscribers before 
you can effectively use them. You can 
acquire subscribers from a number of differ-
ent sources including:

•  Social media campaigns
•  Website signup
•  Blog posts with email signup
•  Word of mouth
•  Discussion forums

Campaign Goal 
Email campaigns need a goal, otherwise you 
can’t be confident that it’s helping you make 
progress. Goals can vary from driving traffic  
to a page for conversions, onboarding new 
customers, building trust, and learning cus-
tomers needs to re-engaging existing or lost 
customers. Create a goal before putting in 
the effort to create the email campaign.

CASE STUDY

EMAIL CAMPAIGN
Share, Discover, Discuss New Products
Product Hunt

Product Hunt is a website that lets users 

share and discover new products. The 
website has grown tremendously over the 
years since it’s inception in 2013. Product Hunt 
has become the place to launch your new 
product, but curiously enough it all started off 
in a Philz Coffee as a 20-minute experiment 
by Ryan Hoover, mainly using email.

c01.indd   166

2/3/2020   5:52:27 PM

Hypothesis 
Ryan believed that product people would 
join an online community to share, discover,  
and discuss new and interesting products. 

Experiment 
Creating the first version of Product Hunt 
as an email campaign. 
In only 20 minutes, Ryan created a group 
on Linkydink, a link-sharing tool built by 
the folks over at Makeshift. At the time, it 
allowed people to share links with a group 
and send them out as a daily email. He 
then invited a few of his startup friends to 
contribute to the group. To promote it, Ryan 
announced the experiment on Quibb (a 
technology focused, online community) and 
Twitter. 

Evidence 
Opens, clicks and shares. 
Within two weeks, over 200 people had sub-
scribed to product discoveries from 30 hand-
picked contributors, consisting of startup 
founders, venture capitalists, and prominent 
bloggers.  
  Ryan also received several unsolicited 
emails and in-person conversations express-
ing their love and support of the project.

Insights 
There is a there, there. 
The response was overwhelmingly posi-
tive and unlike most email that is opened 
and clicked (or not), Ryan had an audience 
openly contributing and sharing links over 
email. He had built up a network over the 
years of hungry entrepreneurs and product 
people. Clearly there was an unmet need of 
a community for product enthusiasts, based 
on the sheer volume of activity from his 
email list.

Actions 
Turning user behavior from email into  
a platform. 
Ryan used what he learned from the experi-
ment to inform the design and technology of 
Product Hunt as a community platform. 
  Since then, Product Hunt graduated from 
Y Combinator (YC S14) and was acquired 
by AngelList for a reported $20 million in 
2016. It's become the place where makers 
and startups launch their new product to 
a global community of founders, journal-
ists, investors, and enthusiastic people in 
technology.

Cost 
Social media campaigns are moderately 
cheap to produce if you are doing the work 
yourself and not paying for social media 
ads. However, costs can go up rather quickly 
($5k to $20k a month), if you are paying  
people to manage and create content.

Setup Time 
Setup time for a social media campaign 
can take days or weeks, depending on how 
much content you need to create. Setup 
time increases as well if you are running it 
across multiple platforms. 

170

Run Time 
Run Time for a social media campaign is 
long, usually several weeks or months.  
You’ll need time to post, read, and respond 
over social media. You’ll also need to  
measure the effectiveness it has toward 
your business goals.

DETAILS

Evidence Strength

# of views 
# of shares 
# of comments 
Engagement is how customers are viewing, 
sharing, and commenting on your social 
media posts. 
  Social media engagement is rather weak 
evidence. You can learn qualitative insights 
from the comments to inform your value 
proposition.

# of clicks 
Click through rate is the number of views 
your social media post receives divided by 
the number who clicked. 

# of conversions 
Conversion rate is the number who clicked 
on the social media link divided by the  
number who used it to sign up or make  
a purchase. 
  Conversions are strong evidence and  
can help you determine what social media 
platform works best for driving business.

Capabilities 
Design / Marketing 
Social media campaigns require a great 
deal of marketing and design: marketing to 
create, respond, and manage social media 
across multiple platforms; design to help 
shape and visualize the content before it is 
posted.

Requirements 
Content 
Social media campaigns are not simply 
posting here and there, they are about 
scheduling content over weeks and months. 
Without content, your campaign will not be 
successful. Make sure you have a plan and 
the resources to create the content before 
jumping into your campaign.

Cost 
Referral programs are moderately cheap. 
You’ll need to incentivize customers (advo-
cates) for making referrals, which will incur 
cost in the way of discounts for both the 
advocate and the customer (friend) being 
referred. Low cost software can help you 
manage referrals, so that you have analyt-
ics on how the program is performing.

Setup Time 
Setup time for a referral program is short. 
You’ll need to configure your referral codes 
and choose which advocates to send them 
to. 

174

Run Time 
Run time for a referral program is long, 
usually several weeks or months. You’ll need 
time for advocates to refer and for their 
friends to decide whether or not to act on 
the referral.

DETAILS

Evidence Strength

# of advocates 
# of advocate shares 
Advocates are the customers you provide 
referral codes to for sharing. The number 
of shares is how many customers actively 
shared the code with friends. 
  Advocate share rate is the number of 
advocates who received a code divided 
by the number who shared it with a friend. 
Target 15% – 20%. 
  Advocates agreeing to accept and share 
a code is relatively strong evidence. They 
are acting to refer friends to your product.

# of friends 
# of friend clicks 
# of friend conversions 
Friends are the people who received the 
code from the advocate.  
  Friend click through rate is the number of 
friends who received the code divided by the 
number who clicked on it. Percent varies by 
channel. Target 50% – 80%. 
  Friend conversion rate is the number who 
clicked on the code divided by the number 
who used it to sign up or make a purchase. 
Target 5% – 15%. 
  Friends accepting the referral code and 
converting is strong evidence. They are act-
ing on a referral for an incentive, so it remains 
to be seen if they will stay over time.

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Marketing 
Referral programs mostly require product 
and marketing capabilities. You’ll need to 
clearly communicate why you are offering 
the discount and how your friends would 
benefit from it. You’ll need design skills if you 
have custom emails, social media posts, or 
landing pages dedicated to the program.

Requirements 
Passionate Customers 
Customers usually do not start out passion-
ate about your product. It takes time for 
them to be satisfied and grow into passion-
ate customers. Therefore, we recommend 
that you gauge this before randomly send-
ing out referral codes. You’ll want to give 
codes to those who you think will actually 
refer their friends to your product and speak 
to it in a positive light.

Cost 
3D prints are moderately cheap. If you are 
printing small basic prototypes to test with 
customers, it can be less expensive. The 
more complex and larger the 3D print, the 
more costly it will be.

Setup Time 
The setup time for a 3D print can take days 
or weeks, depending on your ability to 
model it out and your access to a printer. 

178

Run Time 
Run time for a 3D print is relatively short. 
You’ll want customers interacting with  
the prototype to better understand the  
fit between your value proposition and  
customer jobs, pains, and gains.

DETAILS

Evidence Strength

Customer jobs 
Customer pains 
Customer gains 
Customer jobs, pains, and gains and how the 
prototype could solve for them. 
  The evidence is relatively weak evi-
dence — they need to suspend belief and 
imagine using it in real world scenarios.

Customer feedback 
Customer Quotes 
Take note of additional quotes from the cus-
tomers that are not limited to customer jobs, 
pains, and gains. 
  Customer quotes are relatively weak, but 
helpful for context and qualitative insights 
for upcoming experiments.

Capabilities 
Design / Technology 
You’ll need to be able to model the 3D print 
in software, then create it using a 3D printer. 
Some software is easier to learn that others, 
but the learning curve can be quite steep 
if you don’t have a design background. We 
suggest getting help from a 3D modeling 
expert. With regards to 3D printers, don’t 
rush out and purchase one. Maker spaces 
and workshops usually allow members to 
rent time for creating 3D prints.

Requirements 
Sketches to Model 
Before planning to create a 3D print, make 
sure you’ve spent time testing faster, lower 
fidelity experiments. For example, you 
should have at least placed paper proto-
types in front of customers to receive feed-
back. That feedback should help inform your 
design and solution. It doesn’t necessarily 
mean you make all of the changes custom-
ers requested.

The National Security Agency (NSA) is a 

world leader in cryptology (the art and 

science of making and breaking codes) 
that helps protect sensitive national secu-
rity information, even in space! If you’re like 
most people, the word “satellite” conjures up 
images of a bus-sized object weighing sev-
eral tons and costing hundreds of millions of 
dollars orbiting the Earth for several years.

c01.indd   180

2/3/2020   5:52:36 PM

Experiment 
The team set out to devise a way to help 
these stakeholders quickly and unequivo-
cally see the need for a new solution. After 
a few failed attempts, the team and their 
coach wondered if using a 3D-printer to 
create a life-sized mockup of the CubeSat 
might help them see it. They were ready  
the next day!

Evidence 
The stakeholders immediately saw the need 
for a new solution after seeing how the 
currently certified encryption product simply 
wouldn’t fit in the 3D printed mock-up!

Actions 
The team was resourced, and they confi-
dently began building their solution that will 
be tested in orbit in 2019. 

CubeSats, on the other hand, are a newer 
type of satellite that measure only 10 cm 
× 10 cm × 11.35 cm, weigh less than 2 kg, 
and utilize commercial off-the-shelf compo-
nents. An Innovation Corps (I-Corps) team 
from NSA’s Cybersecurity Solutions Group 
had an idea for creating a new type of 
cryptographic device to secure uplink and 
downlink communications from CubeSats. 
Their solution had dramatically smaller size, 
weight, power, and price characteristics as 
compared to existing products designed and 
certified for use with those expensive bus-
sized satellites.

Hypothesis 
The NSA team believed that… 
Resisting the urge to start building an early 
version of their encryption device, these 
intrapreneurs “got out of the building” to 
validate the desirability of their product. 
Finding broad demand for CubeSat encryp-
tion by external customers, they sought to 
determine if they could get the “buy-in” of 
some key internal stakeholders who unfortu-
nately didn’t see the need for a new solution. 
If we can help them see the need, thought 
the entrepreneurs, then they will authorize 
and fund our project.

Cost 
Paper prototypes are very cheap. You are 
sketching out what the solution could be and 
simulating the experience with paper. Your 
paper prototype should not be an expensive 
endeavor. If you purchase stencils or apps 
to assist in the process it can add a small 
amount of cost.

DETAILS

Evidence Strength

Task completion 
Task completion percentage 
Time to complete tasks 
  Manual task completion is not necessarily 
strong evidence, but it will provide glimpses 
into where customers could get confused.

Setup Time 
Setup time for a paper prototype is rela-
tively short. It should only take a few hours 
to a few days to create your paper proto-
type. It’ll most likely take you longer to find 
customers to test with than to create the 
paper prototype itself. 

184

Customer feedback 
Customer quotes on the value proposition 
and usefulness of the imagined solution. 
  Customer quotes on paper prototypes are 
relatively weak, but can be helpful to inform 
your higher fidelity experiments.

Capabilities 
Design / Research 
In addition to an imagination, you’ll need 
some design skills to sketch out the product. 
You’ll also want to write a coherent script 
and record the sessions.

Requirements 
An Imagined Product 
Paper prototyping requires a great deal of 
imagination and creativity. You’ll need to be 
able to sketch out the flow of the product 
and manually replicate customer interac-
tions. This will require you to think through 
the experience first, before putting it in front 
of potential customers.

Run Time 
Run time for a paper prototype is  also a few 
days to a week. You’ll want to rapidly test 
the paper prototype with target customers, 
to get feedback on the value proposition 
and flow of the solution.

DETAILS

Cost 
Physical brochure costs are low if you can 
use a word processor and have basic design 
skills. The costs increase if you decide to 
outsource the creation of the physical bro-
chure to a professional agency or designer.

Setup Time 
If you have the skills, a brochure should only 
take 1–2 days to set up and create. This 
includes the time needed to define the bro-
chure hypothesis, pull in concepts from your 
Value Proposition Canvas, write the content, 
and include the graphics. If you do not have 
the skills, it can take 1–2 weeks instead. 

Run Time 
Testing your brochure with customers is 
generally quick and only takes about 15 
minutes. Your brochures can be used with 
interviews wherever your customers are 
located physically, whether that be on the 
street, a cafe, or at a conference.

Evidence Strength 
# of brochure views 
# of brochures taken 
# of interviews 
# of people who contact you 
Email % Conversion Rates 
Phone % Conversion Rates 
You can calculate the conversion rate by 
taking the number people given a brochure 
divided by number who took action =  
conversion rate. 
  Brochure conversion rates vary by indus-
try and segment; however, if you target a 
very specific segment for your brochure, 
you should look for a strong signal of 15% or 
more on the call-to-action conversion. 
  When customers take action to reach out, 
it’s a good signal that you are on the right 
path. This is different than a landing page 
where people are giving up their email. On a 
brochure with a call to action, it takes more 
initiative on the customer’s side to take the 
brochure home, read through it, and then 
call or email you to find out more about the 
value proposition you are offering.

196

Capabilities 
Marketing / Research 
Brochures require design skills to create 
a compelling visual experience, with high 
quality images and styling. If you are unable 
to do so, you may get false negatives in 
your testing — people won’t believe your 
value proposition is real. The other import-
ant aspect of the brochure is the copy and 
content. You’ll need to be able to write clear, 
concise sentences that resonate with your 
customers.

Requirements 
Acquisition Plan 
Brochures are different than online digital 
experiments — you need to physically inter-
act with people to distribute them. Have a 
plan about what you are trying to achieve 
and where to find your customers before 
finalizing a brochure. Brainstorm locations to 
visit, such as:

•  Conferences.
•  Meetups.
•  Events. 
•  Cafes.
•  Stores.
•  Door-to-door.

American Family Insurance is a private 

mutual company that focuses on prop-

erty, casualty, and auto insurance. As an 
insurance company, they understand risk 
very well and do not want to build complex 
insurance offerings that no one will buy. In 
this example, the Commercial Farm Ranch 
division was searching for fit for new market 
risk protection offerings.

c01.indd   198

2/3/2020   5:52:49 PM

In the past, this team had used Facebook/ 
Google Ads to drive traffic to a landing 
page, which is a great combination but it 
was difficult to target farmers online, and 
the team wasn’t getting enough qualitative 
insights. So they decided to go analog and 
face-to-face at a large farmer convention.

Hypothesis 
The Farm and Ranch team believed that… 
We believe that farmers desire a new type of 
financial/insurance risk protection offering. 

Experiment 
Going analog with physical brochures. 
The team went to a farming trade show 
in Missouri and handed out professional 
physical marketing brochures with a clearly 
articulated value proposition and solution. 
They had a call to action of getting in touch 
with the team via a phone call or email for 
more information.  
  The team screened for small/mid-sized 
cattle and corn farmers.   
  Their target metric was that 20% of the 
target farmers (small/mid sized cattle or 
corn farmers) would take initiative and call 
or email. 

Evidence 
Conversions using a brochure. 
15% target farmers who received the  
brochure called or emailed requesting  
more info. 
  Qualitative learnings talking to the  
farmers and getting reaction to the  
brochure in face-to-face conversations.

Insights 
Segmenting different types of farmers  
for a stronger value proposition. 
Cattle farmers’ pain points seemed greater 
based on metrics and emotion in conversa-
tions compared to corn farmers. 
  The farmers’ current way to solve the 
problem was to go to a bank and get 
another loan/line of credit but that felt risky 
to them.  
  Several farmer focused banks/credit 
unions were interested in the the concept. 
The team could explore this as a channel.

Actions 
Narrowing in on cattle farmers. 
The team refined the value proposition and 
marketing to be more cattle-farmer specific. 
Next they reran the experiment to see if 
focusing on a more niche customer segment 
would get a more decisive validation signal.

Cost 
The cost of running an Explainer Video is 
relatively cheap, but can get expensive 
quickly depending on the production value. 
There are many products that’ll enable you 
to create an Explainer Video that looks good 
enough, but if you want to stand out, it’ll 
likely cost you for professional videography. 
You should also consider how you’ll drive 
traffic to the Explainer Video as part of the 
cost.

DETAILS

Evidence Strength

# of unique views 
How many unique views you receive and 
from what referral source. 
# of shares 
How many shares of the video there are  
and via what platform. 
  Views and shares are relatively weak 
evidence.

Setup Time 
Good Explainer Videos take a few days or 
weeks to set up. You’ll need to think through 
how to clearly convey your value proposi-
tion, write a script, and do multiple takes 
and edits. 

202

# of clicks 
Click through rate = clicks that your video 
receives divided by the number of views. 
  Clicks are stronger evidence in that peo-
ple are clicking to learn more.

Run Time 
Run time for Explainer Videos is relatively 
long, from several weeks to months, unless 
it goes viral. While viral videos get a lot of 
buzz, they tend to be the outliers. Many 
Explainer Videos require a great deal of 
work to drive traffic to them, both with paid 
advertising and social media.

Comments 
Viewer comments on the video with regard 
to availability, price, and how it works. 
  Comments are relatively weak evidence 
but at times good for qualitative insights.

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Technology 
You’ll need to be able to write a script for 
a compelling Explainer Video, create the 
video, edit it, and then share and promote it 
to your target audience. The Explainer Video 
will need a clear call to action, usually at 
the end, to encourage your audience to click 
and learn more.

Requirements 
Traffic 
Explainer Videos need traffic to generate 
evidence, regardless whether they exist on 
a video hosting platform or a landing page. 
Drive traffic to your Explainer Video using:

•  Online ads.
•  Social media campaigns.
•  Email campaigns.
•  Redirecting existing traffic.
•  Word of mouth.
•  Discussion forums.

Boomerang is ideal for finding unmet needs with potential 
customers in an existing market, without building anything. 

Boomerang is not ideal for stripping away branding and test-
ing a product as if it’s your own.

c01.indd   204

OVERVIEW

Perils of Rebranding 
Competitor Products as 
Yours 
Over time we’ve observed 
Boomerang tests and vari-
ants of it, sometimes called 
Imposter Judo. While, at 
times, these techniques vary 
widely in definition, we have 
come to a consensus that it 
is too risky to rebrand a com-
petitor’s product entirely for 
customer testing purposes. 
  The technique usually 
involves creating a clone of 
the competitor’s, stripping 
away the branding and 
replacing it with your brand-
ing, or a fabricated brand. 
  This has legal and ethical 
implications which we advise 
against, especially for estab-
lished corporations or those 
operating in heavily regulated 
environments. 

Interestingly enough, we’ve 

seen both corporations and 
startups use Boomerang test-
ing with branding intact to get 
an idea of unmet needs.  
  Corporations have pointed 
their Boomerang testing at a 
hot up-and-coming startup. 
  Startups have pointed 
their Boomerang testing 
at entrenched established 
corporations.

Prepare

 □ Identify a product to test 
that has unmet needs 
related to your idea.

 □ Create a script for customer 

testing.

 □ Recruit customers who 

agree to test the product 
and be recorded.

 □ Schedule the Boomerang 

sessions.

 □ Prepare the Boomerang 

location with a competitor’s 
product.

Execute

 □ Share the script and explain 

the goal.

 □ Record the session and take 
notes on what they say, 
where they get stuck, and 
how long it takes them to 
complete tasks.

 □ Wrap up and thank the 

participants.

Analyze

 □ Review your notes with  

the team.

• Which tasks were unfin-

ished? Took the longest?  
Caused the most 
frustration?

 □ Create a Value Proposition 
Canvas for the competition 
indicating where they are 
misaligned.

 □ Use this information to 
inform your upcoming 
experiments to learn more.

Cost 
Boomerang is a low cost experiment involv-
ing pointing people to your competitor’s 
product and not building anything. Any 
incurred costs would be associated with 
sourcing people to test with and recording 
the sessions.

Setup Time 
Setup time for a Boomerang is short, in that 
you only need to find and schedule people 
to participate in the test. 

206

Run Time 
Run time for a Boomerang is short, as the 
sessions should not last more than 30 
minutes each. Even if you schedule several 
of these, it should only take a few days to 
complete.

Capabilities 
Product / Marketing / Research 
Boomerang capabilities include the ability to 
select an applicable product, craft a script, 
recruit an audience to test with, record the 
sessions, and synthesize the results. Many 
of these capabilities reside within product 
and marketing and research. Like interviews, 
these are best performed in pairs when 
possible.

Requirements 
Existing Product 
Before you schedule a Boomerang exper-
iment, you’ll need to identify the existing 
product to use for the testing. It needs to be 
a product from which you can extract  
learning to inform your new idea, otherwise 
the feedback you’ll collect will not be useful.

DETAILS

Evidence Strength

Task completion 
Time to complete the task 
Task completion rate = tasks completed 
divided by tasks attempted. 

Average time to complete a task. 

In the evidence you are looking for unmet 
gaps and needs when it comes to the 
espoused value proposition versus what it 
really takes for an average customer. 
  Evidence for measuring tasks in existing  
competitors’ products is relatively strong —  
you are measuring actual behavior in the 
product.

Customer feedback 
Customer quotes with regards to ease of use 
and unmet needs. 
Look for gaps in what the customer wants 
and expects the product to do versus what it 
does in reality. 
  Customer feedback is relatively weak evi-
dence, but it is helpful in determining unmet 
needs to explore.

DETAILS

Cost 
Cost of Pretend to Own is very cheap, in that 
you are using readily available material 
such as wood and paper. Cost can increase 
with size and complexity.

Setup Time 
Setup time for Pretend to Own is a few min-
utes to a few hours. You don’t want to iterate 
on the design internally very much at all, but 
instead have the bare bones shape and user 
interface. 

Evidence 
When do you use it? 
Engagement Logbook 
Keep a spreadsheet that tracks the amount 
of time it was available and the number of 
occurrences in which you thought it would be 
of use to you. 
  Document the types of uses and in what 
scenarios they occurred. Overall engage-
ment is a relatively weak strength of 
evidence, but you’ll learn firsthand insights 
that can help shape the idea and value 
proposition.

Capabilities 
Design / Research 
Basic design and research skills are helpful 
when running a Pretend to Own experiment. 
You’ll need to be able to create a rough 
replica and then log your activities over 
time.

Requirements 
Pretend to Own doesn’t require a great deal 
to get started: simply an idea that you want 
to validate and some creativity on how to 
create a nonfunctioning replica of it.

210

Run Time 
Run time for Pretend to Own can be several 
weeks to several months, depending on the 
nature of your idea. You’ll want to test it 
over time, in order to forget that it isn’t real 
(almost).

Before the Palm Pilot was created, Jeff 

Hawkins wanted to gauge the desirability 

of the product. He had seen personal digital 
assistants in the past that were feasible, but 
not desirable. These ultimately led to large 
expensive failures.

c01.indd   212

2/3/2020   5:52:59 PM

Jeff Hawkins cut a block of wood to fit the 
overall size of the envisioned product and 
printed out a simple user interface, like the 
one he envisioned. He taped the printout 
over the wooden block and used a wooden 
chopstick as the stylus. This was rough 
enough that it only took hours to create. He 
then carried it around in his pocket at work 
for months to determine the desirability of 
the value proposition in the real world. 
  When someone asked for a meeting or 
email, he would pull the wood block out of 
his pocket, tap on it with the chopstick and 
then put it away. 
  After several instances when he felt it 
would’ve been useful to have the real prod-
uct, only then did he decide to go forward 
with the product development of the Palm 
Pilot.

Adapted from The Right It by Alberto Savoia

 □ Create your nonfunctioning 
replica as soon as possible 
in the design process.

 □ Be thrifty and use low cost, 
commonly available craft 
materials.

 □ Use your creative inspira-

tion to pretend it functions 
in real life.

 □ Keep a logbook of your 

interactions, whether they 
be physical or digital. 

 – Spend a lot of money and 
time creating the replica.

 – Choose extremely large 

and expensive products for 
this technique.

 – Be embarrassed to carry 
it around in real world 
scenarios.

 – Forget to have fun in the 

process.

OVERVIEW

Prepare

 □ Recruit 15–20 target 

customers.

 □ Set up the room with boxes 
and supplies for each table.

Execute

 □ Set the stage by defining 

the area to explore. 

 □ Have each table design a 

box for a product idea they 
would buy. 

 □ Have them include messag-
ing, features, and benefits 
of the imaginary product.

 □ Each team has to imagine 
selling the imaginary prod-
uct at a trade show. Have 
them take turns pitching the 
product to you, a skeptical 
customer.

 □ Take notes during the 

pitches on key messaging, 
features, benefits.

Analyze

 □ Debrief with your team. 

What aspects did the teams 
emphasize over others?

 □ Use what you’ve learned 
to update your Value 
Proposition Canvas. This 
can be the basis of future 
experiments.

Cost 
Running a Product Box experiment is rela-
tively cheap. The materials you need are low 
cost and widely available at craft stores. 
You’ll need cardboard boxes and supplies to 
decorate the box, colored markers, paper, 
and stickers.

Setup Time 
Setup time for Product Box is relatively 
short, in that you’ll need to recruit customers 
to participate. You’ll need to purchase the 
supplies and set up the room. 

216

Run Time 
Run time for Product Box is very short. You 
can facilitate it in less than 1 hour.

DETAILS

Evidence Strength 

Value propositions 
Customer jobs 
Customer pains 
Customer gains 
Collect and organize the key customer jobs, 
pains, and gains offered up by the partici-
pants. Highlight the top three of each. 
  Take note of the messaging of the value 
propositions from the participants, as these 
can inform your own messaging. 
  Artifacts produced by Product Box are 
relatively weak evidence, but they can be 
used to shape and inform your upcoming 
experiments.

Customer feedback 
Customer Quotes 
Take note of additional quotes from the 
customers that are not limited to jobs, pains, 
and gains. 
  Customer quotes are relatively weak  
evidence, but helpful for context and quali-
tative insights for upcoming experiments.

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Research 
Almost anyone can facilitate a Product Box 
with some practice. It will help though if you 
have design, research, and product abilities — 
 you’ll want to assess the outputs and provide  
inspiration when needed.

Requirements 
Idea and Target Customer 
Product Box requirements are not expansive, 
although ideally you’ll want to have an idea 
and target customer in mind. Without this, 
the session will likely go very wide and the 
results will be difficult to interpret.

1. Recruit

3. Facilitate

4. Analyze

 □ Recruit 15–20 customers 

who use your existing prod-
uct for the exercise.

2. Prepare

 □ If it’s in person, you’ll want 
a picture of a speed boat 
and cards. If it’s remote, 
then you’ll need to set up a 
virtual whiteboard that has 
a speed boat and virtual 
cards which customers can 
write on digitally.

 □ Give each customer a few 
minutes to think before 
writing down anchors. After 
they’ve placed them near 
the speed boat, note their 
location. Anchors that are in 
groups, repeating the same 
thing in different ways, are 
clustered together. If they 
are deeper below the speed 
boat, then it means they 
are slowing things down 
more so than others. Be 
mindful to review each card 
with the group, but refrain 
from trying to solve or 
provide feedback. Doing so 
will bias the group and the 
exercise.

 □ Once Speed Boat has con-
cluded and the customers 
have left, assign a severity 
and urgency to each anchor 
as a team. Some you may 
want to address right away 
while others you may ignore 
entirely. These results, 
after you’ve processed  
the anchors, should be 
inputs into your upcoming 
experiments.

Cost 
Running a Speed Boat experiment is rela-
tively cheap. The materials you need are 
a picture of a speed boat, writing utensils, 
and note cards. If you choose to run this 
remotely, then you’ll need to use a virtual 
product, which could slightly increase cost.

Setup Time 
Setup time for Speed Boat is relatively short, 
in that you’ll need to recruit customers to 
participate. You’ll also want to review any 
existing support data that could help inform 
what to look for during the experiment. 

220

Run Time 
Run time for Speed Boat is very short. It 
takes 1–2 hours to facilitate with multiple 
customers involved.

DETAILS

Evidence 

# of anchors 
Severity 
Urgency 
# of severe and urgent anchors 
The higher number of severe and urgent 
anchors, the bigger gap you have between 
your Value Map and your Customer Profile. 
  Artifacts produced by Speed Boat are still 
relatively weak evidence, but it’s stronger 
than simply talking to customers. You are 
unpacking what specifically is keeping 
your product from living up to its value 
proposition.

Customer feedback 
Customer Quotes 
In addition to the anchors, you’ll want to  
collect customer quotes to better under-
stand their context when struggling with  
the product. 
  Customer quotes are relatively weak  
evidence, but helpful for context and quali-
tative insights on your product.

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Technology 
In addition to facilitation capabilities, which 
are not necessarily role specific, you’ll 
need the right people in the room to assign 
severity and urgency to the anchors. Not all 
anchors are created equal, and some you’ll 
want to fix right away while others you may 
ignore entirely.

Requirements 
Facilitation Skills 
Speed Boat requires some degree of facil-
itation skills, especially with a group of 
customers who are about to complain about 
your product. You’ll need to check your ego 
at the door and have the skills to extract the 
specific anchors. If you feel you are unable 
to do so because you are too close to the 
product, then we recommend bringing in  
a neutral third-party facilitator to lead the 
session.

2. Prepare

 □ If it’s in person, you’ll need 
cards you’ve created for 
customer jobs, pains, and 
gains as well as blank 
cards for customers to fill 
out. If it’s remote, then you’ll 
need to set up a virtual 
whiteboard that has cards 
you’ve already created as 
well as blank ones.

 □ Explain the categories of 
customer jobs, pains, and 
gains that you’ve witnessed 
in the market. Have the 
participants map the exist-
ing cards to each category 
and rank them. Encourage 
them to talk out loud as 
they do so. Ask if there are 
any missing and, if so, have 
the participants write them 
down and include them in 
the ranking. Have an addi-
tional person take notes on 
your side during the session 
for qualitative insights.

 □ Once card sorting is 

concluded, identify any 
themes you’ve found and 
calculate how the partici-
pants have ranked the top 
three jobs, pains, and gains.

remotely over video, then you’ll need low-
cost or free virtual white-boarding software.

about a potential niche customer as well. 
Both will require you to put thought into 
customer jobs, pains, and gains so that the 
output can be used to inform your Value 
Proposition Canvas and future experiments.

OVERVIEW

Prepare

Execute

 □ Explain to the customers 
how this is an exercise to 
get their feedback on what 
you are planning to deliver. 
Make sure they understand 
that you value their input.

 □ Have one person conduct 

the interviews and interact 
with the customer.

 □ Have another person write 
notes and act as a scribe.

 □ Wrap up and thank the 

participants.

 □ Define the goals of your 
clickable prototype 
experiment.

 □ Determine the target audi-

ence to test with, preferably 
a group that isn’t cold and 
has no context for your 
offering.

 □ Write your script.

 □ Create your clickable proto-
type screens with hot zones.

 □ Test it internally to make 
sure that the interaction 
works.

 □ Schedule your clickable 

prototype experiments with 
target customers.

Analyze

 □ Place the sketches on the 
wall and place your notes, 
observations, and quotes 
around them.

 □ Where did they get stuck or 

confused?

 □ What did they get excited 

about?

 □ Use this feedback to inform 
your next experiment of the 
experience.

Cost 
Clickable prototypes are a little more 
expensive than paper prototypes, but still 
relatively cheap. There are many tools and 
templates that allow you to quickly create  
a clickable prototype without having to  
create it from scratch yourself.

Setup Time 
Setup time for a clickable prototype is rela-
tively short. It should only take a day or two 
to create your clickable prototype.

238

Run Time 
Run time for a clickable prototype is also 
short, as in a few days to a week. You’ll want 
to rapidly test the clickable prototype with 
target customers, to get feedback on the 
Value Proposition and flow of the solution. 

DETAILS

Evidence  

Task completion 
Task completion percentage.  
Time to complete tasks. 
  Manual task completion is not necessarily 
strong evidence, but it is a bit stronger than 
using paper and will provide glimpses into 
where customers could get confused.

Customer feedback 
Customer quotes on the Value Proposition 
and usefulness of the imagined solution. 
  Customer quotes on clickable prototypes 
are relatively weak evidence, but stronger 
than feedback on paper prototype  
experiments. 

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Technology / Research 
In addition to a digital product idea, you’ll 
need design skills to create the appearance 
of the product in a prototype tool or template.  
It’ll require you to create hot zones that link 
to other mocked up screens once clicked. 
You’ll also want to write a script and have 
the sessions recorded.

Requirements 
A Digital Product Idea 
Clickable prototyping requires that your 
idea be digital in nature, since your audience 
will be clicking through a digital experience 
on a screen. At the point at which you’re con-
sidering a clickable prototype, you should 
have a strong opinion on what the flow of 
the product should look like, but still be open 
to it being wrong.

Cost 
Single Feature MVPs are a bit more expen-
sive then low fidelity experiments, because 
you're creating a higher fidelity version that 
delivers value to the customer.

Setup Time 
Setting up a Single Feature MVP can take 
1–3 weeks. You’ll need to design, create, 
and test it out internally before involving 
customers. You are likely going to charge 
for this version, so it’ll need to do one thing 
really well.

242

Run Time 
Running a Single Feature MVP experiment 
can take several weeks or months. You’ll 
want to run it long enough to analyze qual-
itative and quantitative feedback before 
prematurely optimizing or trying to scale. 

DETAILS

Evidence  

Customer satisfaction 
Customer quotes and feedback on how sat-
isfied they were after receiving the output 
from your Single Feature MVP. 
  Customer satisfaction evidence is strong 
in this case because you are asking for 
feedback after the value was delivered to 
the customer, instead of a hypothetical 
situation.

# of purchases 
Customer purchases from using the Single 
Feature MVP. 
  Payments are strong evidence, even if 
it’s only a single feature customers are 
purchasing.

Cost 
How much does it cost to design, create, 
deliver, and maintain a Single Feature MVP? 
  The cost it takes you to deliver a Single 
Feature MVP is strong evidence and a lead-
ing indicator of what it’ll take to create a 
viable business in the future. 

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Technology / Legal / 
Marketing / Finance 
You’ll need all of the capabilities to create 
and deliver the feature to the customer. 
This is very context specific, depending on 
whether you are delivering a physical or  
digital product or service to the end customer.

Requirements 
Evidence of Niche Customer Need 
This is a longer, more expensive experiment 
with a higher transaction cost. Before con-
sidering a Single Feature MVP, you’ll need 
to have worked through a series of lower 
fidelity experiments to inform the feature. 
You should have clear evidence of a specific 
customer need that the feature will address.

c01.indd   245

2/3/2020   5:53:25 PM

 
 
Cost 
Mash-Ups are a bit more expensive then low 
fidelity experiments, since you need to piece 
together multiple existing technological 
components to deliver an overall solution. 
The costs incurred will be paying for the 
existing technology and the effort to wire it 
all together.

Setup Time 
Setting up a Mash-Up can take 1–3 weeks. 
You’ll need to evaluate and piece together 
existing technology.

246

Run Time 
Running a Mash-Up experiment can take 
several weeks or months. You’ll want to run 
it long enough to analyze qualitative and 
quantitative feedback before prematurely 
optimizing or trying to scale. 

DETAILS

Evidence  

Customer satisfaction 
Customer quotes and feedback on how sat-
isfied they were after receiving the output 
from your Mash-Up. 
  Customer satisfaction evidence is strong 
in this case because you are asking for 
feedback after the value was delivered to 
the customer, instead of a hypothetical 
situation.

# of purchases 
Customer purchases from using the 
Mash-Up. 
  Payments are strong evidence, even if 
they don’t realize it’s pieced together  
behind the scenes with existing technology. 

Cost 
How much does it cost to design, create, 
deliver, and maintain a Mash-Up? 
  The cost it takes you to deliver a Mash-Up 
is strong evidence and a leading indicator 
of what it’ll take to create a viable business 
in the future.

Capabilities 
Design / Technology / Product /  
Marketing / Legal / Finance 
You’ll need to be able assess existing 
technology, choose the right components, 
and integrate them together into a solu-
tion that can deliver the needed value to 
customers. It doesn’t necessarily mean you 
need to know how all the technology works, 
but you’ll need to know enough to put it all 
together behind the scenes. In addition, the 
Mash-Up will need all of the other character-
istics of a legitimate product.

Requirements 
A Process to Automate 
This is another longer, more expensive 
experiment with a higher transaction cost. 
Before considering a Mash-Up, you’ll need to 
have run enough lower fidelity experiments 
to have an idea of the process you’ll need 
to deliver value to the customer. Use that 
process knowledge to begin the assessment 
of what existing technology you could piece 
together to deliver that value.

You’ll need all of the capabilities to man-
ually create and deliver the product to 
the customer. This is very context specific, 
depending on whether you are delivering a 
physical or digital product or service to the 
end customer.     

Requirements 
Time 
The biggest requirement for a concierge  
test is time. Your time. The team’s time. If 
you do not make time to run this experiment, 
it will be frustrating for both you and the 
customer. Be sure to plan when you will run 
the Concierge experiment and clear your 
schedule so that you can give it the atten-
tion it will need. 

Cost 
As long as you keep the concierge experi-
ments small and simple, they are cheap to 
run, mostly because you are doing all of the 
work manually with little to no technology 
involved. If you try to scale the experiment 
or make it overly complex, it’ll increase the 
cost.

Setup Time 
Setting up a concierge experiment takes a 
bit longer than other rapid prototyping tech-
niques, because you have to manually plan 
out all of the steps and acquire customers 
for it.

250

Run Time 
Running a concierge experiment can take 
days to weeks, depending on how complex 
the process is and how many customers  
you involve in the experiment. It generally 
takes longer than other rapid prototyping 
techniques.  

DETAILS

Evidence  

Customer satisfaction 
Customer quotes and feedback on how  
satisfied they were after receiving the output  
from your experiment. 
  Customer satisfaction evidence is strong 
in this case because you are asking for 
feedback after the value was delivered to 
the customer, instead of a hypothetical 
situation.

# of purchases 
Customer purchases from the concierge 
experiment. What are they willing to pay  
for a manual experience? 
  Payments are strong evidence, even if  
you are manually delivering value. 

Time it takes to complete the process 
Lead time is the total time measured from 
customer request to when the order was 
delivered. 
  Cycle time is the amount of time spent 
working on the request. It does not include 
the time the request sits idle before action 
was taken on it. 
  The time it takes for you to complete the 
concierge experiment is very strong, in that 
it gives you firsthand knowledge of the steps 
needed to receive a request and deliver 
value to a customer.

CONCIERGE
Buying and Selling a Home
Realtor.com

Realtor.com is a real estate listings web-

site operated by Move, Inc. out of Santa 

Clara, California. It provides buyers and 
sellers with the information, tools and pro-
fessional expertise they need throughout 
the home journey.

c01.indd   252

2/3/2020   5:53:30 PM

As realtor.com teams spoke with people who 
were looking to sell their home, one of the 
problems commonly heard was the struggle 
with timing the process of selling a house 
with buying a new one. When people move, 
they end up moving to another zip code or 
other cities or even other states.  
  The idea was to aggregate and show 
the market insights for them with the two 
markets side by side. Would that be useful 
for them? Would we extend that into a real 
feature?

Hypothesis 
The realtor.com team believed that sellers 
on their site who are looking to sell within 
the next year will also be buying at the 
same time.

Experiment 
Concierge delivery of PDF insights. 
The team did a simple concierge experiment 
that was triggered by a call to action. When 
clicked, the modal window highlighting a 
value proposition for insights on timing your 
ability to buy and sell at the same time 
appeared. Users would then click through 
a series of questions. Once complete, Dave 
Masters (the product manager) manually 
created the output by piecing together 
insights from other parts found throughout 
Realtor.com into a PDF.  

  Dave would then individually email 
these PDFs out to the users who signed 
up. Additionally in his email to them, Dave 
added a meeting link to further connect to 
these users in hopes to learn more and see 
how we could help. 

Evidence 
80 signups in just a few minutes. 
It surpassed expectations quite quickly. 
Based on site statistical data, the team had 
estimated that it would generate 30 signups 
within 3 hours. It generated more than 80 
signups in a few minutes, faster than they 
could even shut it off.

Insights 
Hypothesis validated — audience has prob-
lem. The team learned that a reasonably 
large pool of people within their site that 
had the buying and selling problem. 
  The team also learned about the chal-
lenge with concierge testing. High volume 
could be a good sign but might require you 
to do a lot more manual work than you ini-
tially set out to do. It’s probably worth noting 
that this type of work requires your ability to 
execute for these users. When dual-tracking 
work, you have to anticipate and set aside 
appropriate time to deliver on this promise 
and really aim to learn. With the copious 
amounts of work you might have in your 
day-to-day, it can be hard to manage it all.

Actions 
Persevere by testing in app features. 
Knowing the audience mix was roughly  
the size anticipated, the team felt confident 
in moving forward with more experiments 
targeting these users within this app. In fact, 
the very next experiment was a feature stub 
that included a link to a nonexistent tab 
for “Selling-Tools” — a place that the team 
would begin to put Seller specific features 
and tests.

Cost 
Life-sized prototypes can be moderately 
expensive. They need to have a believable 
level of polish and the bigger the size, the 
greater the expense.

Setup Time 
The setup time for a life-sized prototype 
can be quite long, depending on the size 
and complexity of your solution. It may take 
several weeks or months to create a high 
fidelity replica.

256

Run Time 
Run time for a life-sized prototype is rela-
tively short. You’ll want customers interact-
ing with the prototype to better understand 
the fit between your Value Proposition and 
their customer jobs, pains, and gains.  

DETAILS

Evidence  

Customer jobs 
Customer pains 
Customer gains 
Customer feedback 
Customer jobs, pains, and gains and how  
the prototype could solve for them. 
  Take note of additional quotes from the 
customers that are not limited to customer 
jobs, pains, and gains. 
  The evidence is relatively weak evidence —  
they need to suspend belief and imagine 
using it in real world scenarios.

# of successful mock sales 
You can calculate the mock sale conversion 
rate by taking the number people who view 
the price divided by the number of people 
who filled out payment information. 
  Payment information submission is very 
strong evidence. 

# of email signups 
Conversion rate on people who you inter-
viewed who provided their email address to 
be contacted when the solution is available. 
  Customer emails are rather weak  
evidence, but good for future experiments.

Capabilities 
Design / Product 
You’ll need mostly product and design capa-
bilities to create the life-sized prototype. It 
doesn’t need to be fully operational or have 
all of the bells and whistles, but it needs to 
be at a high enough fidelity to interact with 
customers.

Requirements 
Evidence of a Solution 
Before considering a life-sized prototype, 
you’ll want to have a significant amount  
of evidence that a solution is needed.  
This means you’ve gathered and generated 
evidence of unmet customer jobs, pains,  
and gains in the market that warrant testing 
a high fidelity experiment with customers.

LIFE-SIZED PROTOTYPE
Validating a Physical Space
Zoku

Zoku is a hive of smart lofts and friendly 

spaces based in Amsterdam and is viewed 

by experts as the next evolution of Airbnb. 
They provide a home base for traveling 
professionals who are living and working in 
a city for periods from a few days to a few 
months. As is the case any time you create 
a new market, the Zoku team has risky 
assumptions about their business that 
need testing.

c01.indd   258

2/3/2020   5:53:34 PM

Hypothesis 
The Zoku team believed that traveling pro-
fessionals would like to stay for weeks and 
months in a micro-apartment of only 25m2 
(around 250 square feet).

Experiment 
Testing living spaces with customers. 
The team built a Life-Sized prototype of 
the micro-apartment to test with traveling 
professionals to determine if they’d stay 
for weeks and months. They sourced 150 
traveling professionals, shuttling them over 
from their workplaces, to interact with the 
Life-Sized Prototype. 
  Travelers toured and stayed in the Life-
Sized Prototype. The Zoku team interviewed 
them while they interacted with the physical 
space, learning about what worked and 
what didn’t in the design. 

Evidence 
Gathering qualitative feedback on  
the space. 
People were the most enthusiastic about 
staying when the space used stacking,  
eliminating internal walls and circulation.  
If the stairs are in, there is more living space; 
if the stairs are out it becomes circulation 
space for the sleeping area. This evidence 
especially came out when they tested with 
groups of 4–5 people at once.

Insights 
The experience of the space means more 
than the size of the space. 
The experiment helped the Zoku team 
understand nuances about the prototype. 
When stacked all the normal home elements 
(sleeping area, storage area, bathroom and 
kitchen) on to each other like Tetris/Lego, it 
resulted in a distinction between secondary 
space (functional elements) and primary 
space (living space to move around and put 
your loose furniture).  
  During the course of all the validation 
rounds they learned that “the experience 
of space” is different from the amount of 
square feet and can be positively influenced 
by clear sight lines through the furniture 
(the shutters in the sleeping area), large 
windows, and smart lighting. 

Actions 
Testing space flow with cleaning services. 
Using what they had learned from the 
Life-Sized Prototype testing, the team ran 
another round of testing with cleaning 
services for the unit. This helped them learn 
about the service challenges, specifically 
with the raised sleeping platform.

Connections

1
Value propositions come 
from your Value Map. Do not 
create your Value Proposition 
in a vacuum or neglect the 
work that you’ve already 
done. The Value Map contains 
hypotheses and your landing 
page value proposition test  
is a great way to prove or 
disprove those hypotheses.

2
Customer pains come from 
your Customer Profile. Take 
the top three voted customer 
pains from the canvas and 
include them in the pains 
description at the bottom left 
of the landing page.

3
Solution comes from the 
Value Map product and 
service. The visitor needs to 
know how you are delivering 
the Value Proposition in a real 
tangible way. The product and 
services in the middle column 
of the page should reflect this.

4
Gains come from the customer  
profile. Take the top three 
voted customer gains from the 
canvas and include them in the 
gains description at the bottom  
right of the landing page.

c01.indd   261

DETAILS

Evidence  
Unique Views 
Time Spent on Page 
Email Signups 
You can calculate the conversion rate by 
taking the number views divided by actions 
= conversion rate. Email conversion rates 
vary widely by industry but on average it’s 
between 2% – 5%. For early stage validation 
we recommend 10% –15% in that you want 
to be better than average, otherwise why 
create something new? 
  Email is a rather weak strength of evi-
dence, in that everyone has email and they 
give it out freely if even mildly interested. 
It’s not difficult to unsubscribe or send 
unwanted email to a junk folder.

Cost 
Landing pages are relatively cheap to 
produce, mostly due to the fact that digital 
tools have evolved and are much easier to 
use. It’s one of the cheapest ways you can 
test your Value Proposition at scale with 
potential customers.

Setup Time 
Landing pages can be deceptively difficult 
to do, mostly because you are distilling 
down all the customer jobs, pains, and gains 
into short easy-to-understand statements. 
Still, it shouldn’t take more than a few days 
at most to design a landing page.

262

Run Time 
Run time takes a few weeks, although it is 
largely depending on the amount of traffic 
you can drive to the landing page. If the 
daily traffic is low (i.e., less than 100 unique 
visitors), then you’ll need to run the test for 
a longer period of time to gather sufficient 
information. 

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Technology  
Landing pages need to communicate the 
value clearly and succinctly in the language 
of the customer. You’ll need the ability to do 
this well, otherwise it has the risk of gen-
erating false negatives. If you do not have 
these abilities yourself, then don’t despair 
because you are in luck. There are many 
landing page services that have professional- 
looking templates that allow you to cre-
ate landing pages using drag-and-drop 
technology.

Requirements 
Traffic 
Landing pages need traffic to generate evi-
dence, generally about 100 unique visitors a 
day. The good news is that there are many 
ways you can drive traffic to your landing 
page, including:

•  Online ads.
•  Social media campaigns.
•  Email campaigns.
•  Redirecting existing traffic.
•  Word of mouth.
•  Discussion forums.

EXPERIMENTSVALIDATIONCONISDERATIONS

  Create a sub-brand or new company to 
test the business idea. It allows you to go 
faster, without the endless meetings around 
branding and what happens if people sign 
up. A side effect of this approach is that you 
won’t be able to leverage existing acquisition  
channels for the brand. This means you’ll 
need to do your own customer acquisition 
by running ads, talking to people, and using 
social media to drive traffic.

Branding Concerns 
Branding the landing page can become a  
hand-wringing decision if you are part of a 
larger corporation. Startups have the luxury 
of testing without drawing attention, based 
on their brand alone. They can launch a 
landing page and when people sign up, 
it’s rarely because of the startup’s brand. 
Instead, people sign up because the idea 
stands on its own merit as a solution that 
can solve a problem for them. 

If corporations keep the landing page 
on-brand, with the corporate logo front-and-
center, it can make things harder for the 
team. Branding and marketing reviews will 
usually slow down the process by weeks, if 
not months. People will visit the page just to 
check it out because of the branding. It can 
be difficult to sift through all of the traffic 
noise to see who is really interested in the 
Value Proposition. 

 □ Use the words from cus-
tomer interviews in your 
headline. 

 □ Contact the people who 

signed up and ask if they 
are available for customer 
interviews.

 □ Use high quality photos 

and videos.

 □ Use a short domain name. 

 – Don’t include fake tes-
timonials to generate 
conversions.

 – Don’t label products as 
“sold out” when you’ve  
not yet created them.

 – Don’t make unrealistic 

claims for your product.

 – Don’t use a negative or 

harsh tone.

OVERVIEW

 □ Review how many pledges 
were received, the amount 
for each, and if you reached 
your funding target goal.

 □ If you did not achieve your 
goal, use what you’ve 
learned to iterate on the 
campaign.

 □ If you did achieve your goal, 
then keep actively respond-
ing on your progress to 
backers through social 
media and email.

 □ How did different traffic  

sources convert? For exam-
ple, if a specific social media 
ad or email campaign 
causes more customers to 
pledge, you may want to 
keep that in mind for cus-
tomer acquisition once the 
product is live and for sale.

1

 □ Define the dollar amount for 
your funding target goal. Be 
pragmatic and specific on 
how the money will be used 
for each activity needed to 
create the product.

 □ Choose an existing crowd-
funding platform or create 
your own, custom crowd-
funding website.

 □ Create your crowdfunding 
video. It should be high 
quality and draw the user 
in to convince them to fund 
your product.

 □ Include a Value Proposition 

statement below your video 
in large font, preferably 
header sized.

 □ Place your call to action for 
funding the product to the 
right of the video in clear 
language.

 □ Include customer pains, 
your solution, and the 
customer gains below the 
Value Proposition.

 □ Include different pledge 
amounts and desirable 
perks.

 □ Account for the commission 
percentage crowdfunding 
platforms take as a fee 
from your campaign.

 □ Refund those who contrib-
uted if you didn’t meet 
your goal.

 □ Be specific and transparent 
on how the funds you are 
raising will be used, includ-
ing a cost breakdown of 
the activities. 

 – Include so may perks that 
you spend all of your time 
fulfilling them instead of 
building the product.

 – Be greedy and raise more 
than you need for your 
product build.

 – Cut corners on the produc-
tion quality of your video.

Cost 
Crowdfunding costs are typically focused 
around the video production, marketing, 
logistics, and length of campaign. Even 
though there are crowdfunding platforms 
available, the fidelity needs to be high or 
you will not garner interest from customers.

Setup Time 
Crowdfunding campaigns can take a few 
weeks to a few months to put together. It’s 
not trivial to produce a compelling, high 
quality video, create content that conveys 
the Value Proposition, and structure the  
pricing tiers and perks for your customers.

268

Run Time 
Run time typically takes 30 – 60 days for a 
crowdfunding campaign to run its course. 
This isn’t to say you won’t be wildly suc-
cessful and fund it in less — just be aware 
that those funded in a few days are the 
exceptions.

your idea gets funded. 
  Viewers pledging their money to make 
your crowdfunding campaign a success is

their wallets, not just their words.

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Marketing / Finance 
Crowdfunding’s popularity has created a 
rise in crowdfunding platforms, which means 
you don’t need an entire development team 
to create a campaign anymore. You’ll still 
need to create an authentic campaign with 
interesting perks, while building awareness 
in the market. Design plays a big role here in 
that it needs to look professional, otherwise 
you may get false negatives on your Value 
Proposition. Finance plays a bigger role,  
in that you need to correctly spec out your 
pricing tiers and perks in hopes that you 
can build a sustainable business from the 
campaign.

Requirements 
Value Proposition and Customer Segment 
Before jumping into a crowdfunding cam-
paign, you’ll need a clear Value Proposition 
that you can turn into a high quality 
video and a target customer segment. 
Crowdfunding campaigns without videos are 
few and far between and their success rate 
is quite low. You’ll also want to know how 
you are targeting the customer, otherwise 
it’ll be very difficult to drive people to it.

script into your page or app, then log into 
the product and configure the Split Tests. 
It resembles using a word processor, by 
dragging, dropping, and typing. Split Tests 
become more expensive if you are building 
customized hardware or printing out mailers,  
since you have to physically make two  
different versions to test with customers.

272

Setup Time 
The setup time for Split Tests is relatively 
short, especially with digital products where 
you can use existing Split Testing tools. 
Setup time can be a bit longer if you are 
physically making two different versions.

Run Time 
The run time for Split Tests usually spans 
several days to weeks. You’ll want to have 
statistically significant data to gain insights 
into which one performed better.  

DETAILS

Evidence Strength  

Traffic 
Control A behavior 
Control A Conversion Rate 
Conversion rate is the number of people who 
are routed into the Control A test divided by 
number of actions. Use previous data if pos-
sible to predict what the control conversion 
rate is for a baseline.

Variant B behavior 
Variant B Conversion Rate 
Conversion rate is the number of people 
who are routed into the Variant B divided by 
number of actions. Define what measurable 
impact you’d like Variant B to have on the 
conversion percentage. 

Evidence strength is moderate — customers 
aren’t aware they are participating in the 
Split Test. You’ll want to have, at the very 
least, an 80% confidence level in the results. 
Ideally you’d want 98% confidence level, 
but it can vary depending on what you are 
testing. Use an online Split Test calculator to 
help guide you through the process. 

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Technology / Data 
You’ll need the capabilities required to 
define what you’ll be testing, the expected 
baseline for Control A, and the needed 
improvement from Variant B. You’ll want to 
design it visually to fit the overall theme, 
otherwise you’ll receive false negatives. It’ll 
require some degree of technology to inte-
grate if it’s software. Lastly, you’ll need to 
be able to analyze the results to help inform 
your next experiment.

Requirements 
Significant Traffic 
Split Tests need a significant amount of 
traffic to generate believable evidence. Your 
traffic will be randomized to display either 
Control A or Variant B to the customer. If you 
have little to no traffic, it’ll take entirely too 
much time to come to a conclusion that one 
performs better than the other.

Cost 
Presales are relatively cheap, but unlike 
mock sales you have the additional costs 
of processing the transaction and shipping 
the product. If you are using a point of sale 
system, then you may need to purchase 
hardware or software. In addition, most 
payment systems take a percentage of your 
sales (2%–3%) and may charge a monthly 
fee on top of that.

Setup Time 
Setup time for a presale is relatively short. 
Once you are close to shipping your product,  
it requires the setup of accepting and pro-
cessing financial information.

276

Run Time 
Run time for a presale is a few days or 
weeks. You’ll want to target a specific 
audience with your solution and give 
them enough time to consider a purchase. 
Presales aren’t usually very long — payment 
providers may require you to ship product 
within 20 days of purchase.

DETAILS

Evidence  

# of unique views 
# of purchases 
You can calculate the purchase conversion 
rate by taking the number people who view 
the price divided by the number of purchases. 
  Purchases are strong evidence. 
Customers are paying for your solution 
before it is generally available to the public. 

# of abandons 
Mostly associated with online shopping 
carts, if people are beginning the purchase 
process and then leaving, they are aban-
doning the sale.  
  You can calculate the abandonment rate 
by dividing the total number of completed 
purchases by the number of people who 
entered the purchase process. 
  People dropping out of the purchase  
process is strong evidence, albeit a bad sign. 
It means something is incorrect with your 
process, misconfigured, or the purchase 
price is not appropriate.

Capabilities 
Design / Sales / Finance 
Conducting a presale will require defining 
your price options. You’ll also need to design 
the sale in such a way that it is the right 
fidelity for your target audience. Finally, 
you’ll need sales capability, especially if 
you are conducting these in person in the 
physical world.

Requirements 
Ability to Fulfill 
Presales are different than mock sales: 
you are collecting and processing payment 
information, conducting an actual sale.  
This means you should be close to the final 
solution or at the very least have a minimum  
viable product to deliver. Do not rush ahead 
and conduct several presales without having  
the ability to fulfill your promise to customers.

Ranking Customer Jobs, Pains, and Gains    
Another popular type of validation survey 
is validating the importance ranking of the 
jobs, pains, and gains in your Customer 
Profile in the Value Proposition Canvas. Most 
teams take their best guess at this ranking 
in a workshop setting, but need to quickly 
get feedback from outside the building to 
see how close they are to the real world. You 
can easily do this in most survey software 
today by creating two boxes, one for the list 
and next to it one for the customer ranking.

Other Types of Validation Surveys 
Validation surveys are, in general, very sim-
ple with closed-ended feedback responding 
to a single question. With that in mind, you 
can apply that to other types of assumptions  
you wish to validate with your customers 
such as:

•  CSAT (customer satisfaction).
•  CES (consumer effort score).
•  Brand awareness.

Sean Ellis Test 
One type of survey is called the Sean Ellis 
Test, which is named after it’s creator 
and growth-hacking expert Sean Ellis. His 
approach is to gauge desirability through 
scarcity. 
  The Sean Ellis Test keys in on one import-
ant question: “How disappointed would you 
be if you could no longer use this product? 
Very disappointed, somewhat disappointed, 
or not disappointed?” 

It can be argued that you’ve not achieved 

product/market fit until a score of 40% is 
reached. If customers are apathetic and do 

not care if your product goes away, then you 
have a desirability problem. It doesn’t make 
sense to scale before you have fit, otherwise 
you can waste a lot of money scaling things 
that no one wants. 
  Context is important when running a Sean 
Ellis Test. If you run it as soon as the customer 
experiences the Value Proposition, it can feel 
very out of place and return skewed data 
because they’ve yet to really experience the 
product. Who is going to genuinely be disap-
pointed if they’ve never really used it? 
  On the flip side, if you show this survey to 
someone who hasn’t used the product in six 

months, then there’s a good chance they’re 
long gone and won’t even take the survey at 
this point. 
  The recommendation is to show this 
survey to gauge desirability with customers 
who have experienced the core of your prod-
uct at least twice in the past two weeks.

NPS  
Net promoter score (NPS) is one of the most 
common types of surveys and is widely 
adopted by organizations around the world.  
  The key question for a NPS survey is: 
“How likely is it that you would recommend 
this product to a friend or colleague? 
0 (not at all) to  10 (extremely likely)” 
  You can calculate NPS score using the  
following formula: 

  % PROMOTERS - % DETRACTORS = NPS 

Much like the Sean Ellis test, the context 
of when you show this to your customer 

matters. They need to have completed 
something meaningful in your product 
before they would be willing to recommend 
it to a friend or colleague. While interesting, 
it’s not enough for customers to want to 
recommend before they’ve used it. Likewise, 
it’ll be tough to believe customers who say 
they’ll recommend if they’ve used it, but 
wouldn’t be disappointed if it went away 
entirely. Use the NPS after they’ve answered 
the Sean Ellis test.  
  You want to avoid prematurely scaling  
a business based on hypothetical referrals, 
from people who’d not be disappointed if 
your product went away.

Cost 
Validation surveys are inexpensive because 
you should already have a channel to reach 
them. There are many tools and services 
today to help you intercept active customers  
on your website through a pop-up or email,  
if they trigger a specific action.

Setup Time 
Setting up a validation survey is relatively 
quick and should take you a few hours or a 
day to configure.

DETAILS

Evidence  

How disappointed would you be? 
% Disappointed. 
More than 40% disappointed is an ideal 
score before you worry about scaling your 
business. Otherwise, you’ll churn out people 
as fast as you sign them up. 
  Survey data is rather weak, but hinting 
that the product could go away will solicit  
a better response. 

282

Run Time 
If you have sufficient validation survey distri-
bution channels, a survey may only take 1–3 
days to get thousands of responses. If you 
have a difficult time reaching your audience, 
it may take a few weeks to get enough 
responses. 

How likely would you be to refer? 
% Likely to Refer 
More than 0% is considered good, although 
these can vary by industry. You’ll want to 
search online for industry benchmarks. 
  NPS survey data is weaker than a Sean 
Ellis test. You are getting answers to a  
hypothetical referral situation. 

Jobs / Pains / Gains ranking 
% Accuracy When Compared to  
Customer Profile 
Aim for 80%, since being wrong on this has 
ripple effects in your entire strategy. 
  Rather weak strength but an important 
step before moving to more involved testing.

Capabilities 
Product / Marketing / Research 
Validation surveys require the ability to 
carefully craft questions and have the correct  
tone and structure. Because validation sur-
veys target existing customers, you’ll need 
to be able to identify specific segments and 
sub-segments to help reduce noise in the 
data. 

Requirements 
Quantitative Source Material 
Validation surveys are meant to have  
customers respond to a situation, price,  
or feature. You’ll need to have something  
for them to respond to so that you can 
quantitatively measure their responses.  

Channel to an Existing Customer 
Validation surveys are meant for existing 
customers, which means you need to con-
firm you can leverage the existing channel 
to reach them, whether that is online via  
the website, by email, or offline via direct 
mail or a handout.

Drawing a Line in the Sand 
Wizard of Oz is one way to address the 
issue of prematurely scaling a solution. We 
recommend drawing a line in the sand where 
automation of the manual Wizard of Oz 
tasks makes sense. 

If it takes you 15 minutes to manually 

create the value for the end customer,  
ask yourself:

1. How many customer requests could  

we perform manually each day?
2. What is the cost to deliver each one  

(cost structure)?

3. What is the most customers will pay  

(revenue streams)?

4. At what volume is it more cost effective  

to automate these tasks?

We’ve witnessed entrepreneurs rush to 
automate the solution and, in turn, prema-
turely scale. When you draw a line in the 
sand to manually deliver the value, then 
you don’t have to scale until that threshold 
is exceeded. Some entrepreneurs exceed 
it and and then turn to automation. Others 
may never hit the threshold. For those who 
never hit it, we recommend taking a step 
back and re-evaluating the strategy.

Cost 
As long as you keep the Wizard of Oz exper-
iments small and simple, they are cheap to 
run, mostly because you are doing all of the 
work manually with little to no technology 
involved. If you try to scale the experiment or 
make it overly complex, it’ll increase the cost.

Setup Time 
Setting up a Wizard of Oz experiment takes 
a bit longer than other rapid prototyping 
techniques, because you have to manually 
plan out all of the steps and acquire cus-
tomers for it.

286

Run Time 
Running a Wizard of Oz experiment can take 
days to weeks, depending on how complex 
the process is and how many customers 
you involve in the experiment. It generally 
takes longer than other rapid prototyping 
techniques.

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Tech / Legal / Marketing 
You’ll need all of the capabilities to man-
ually create and deliver the product to 
the customer. This is very context specific, 
depending on whether you are delivering  
a physical or digital product or service to  
the end customer.

Requirements 
Time 
The biggest requirement for a Wizard of 
Oz experiment is time, closely followed by 
a digital curtain. Like the Concierge exper-
iment, you’ll need quite a bit of time to 
perform the testing but in addition to this, 
you’ll need a curtain to hide the people per-
forming the tasks from the customer. This 
can take many forms, but the most common 
is a simple landing page or digital interface 
where the customer requests and receives 
the value.

DETAILS

Evidence  

Customer satisfaction 
Customer quotes and feedback on how  
satisfied they were after receiving the output  
from your experiment. 
  Customer satisfaction evidence is strong  
in this case because you are asking for feed-
back after the value was delivered to the 
customer, instead of a hypothetical situation. 

# of purchases 
Customer purchases from the Wizard of Oz 
experiment. What are they willing to pay for 
a manual experience? 
  Payments are strong evidence, even if  
you are manually delivering value.

Time it takes to complete the process 
Lead time is the total time measured from 
customer request to when the order was 
delivered. 
  Cycle time is the amount of time spent 
working on the request. It does not include 
the time the request sits idle before action  
is taken on it. 
  The time it takes for you to complete the 
Wizard of Oz experiment is very strong — it 
gives you firsthand knowledge of the steps 
needed to receive a request and deliver 
value to a customer.

Cost 
Mock sale is relatively cheap: you are price 
testing your product without building all of 
it. You’ll need a believable level of fidelity 
for your target audience, so there is some 
cost in presenting your solution digitally or 
physically.

Setup Time 
Setup time for a mock sale is relatively 
short, meaning you can create a believable 
platform for your Value Proposition in a few 
hours or a few days.

290

Run Time 
Run time for a mock sale is a few days 
or weeks. You’ll want to target a specific 
audience with your solution and give them 
enough time to consider a purchase.

DETAILS

Evidence  

# of unique views 
# of purchase clicks 
You can calculate the purchase conversion 
rate by taking the number of people  
who view the price divided by the number  
of purchase clicks. 
  Purchase clicks are relatively strong, 
although not as strong as subsequent email 
and payment submissions. 

# of purchase email signups 
You can calculate the purchase email con-
version rate by taking the number of people 
who view the price divided by the number  
of email signups. 
  Email signups after purchase clicks are 
relatively strong, although not as strong as 
payment submissions.

# of purchase payment  
Information submitted 
You can calculate the purchase payment 
conversion rate by taking the number of 
people who view the price divided by the 
number who filled out payment information. 
  Payment info submissions are very  
strong evidence.

Capabilities 
Design / Sales / Finance 
Conducting a mock sale will require financial 
modeling skills to inform the price options. 
You’ll also need to design the sale in such a 
way that it is the right fidelity for your target 
audience. Finally, you’ll need sales capabil-
ity, especially if you are conducting these in 
person in the physical world.

Requirements 
Pricing Strategy 
Mock sale does require some thought and 
number crunching before you conduct the 
experiment. This isn’t a scenario where you 
simply ask people how much they’ll pay. 
Customers are notoriously bad at answering 
that question. Instead, you’ll need to be able 
to present a sale price or multiple prices to 
have them respond. If you test a ridiculously 
low price, then you’ll receive false positives 
on something you won’t be able to deliver. 
Therefore, spend time thinking through the 
cost structure to make the mock sale  
evidence worthwhile.

MOCK SALE
They will come, when you build it.
Buff er

When Joel Gascoigne, cofounder of 

Buffer, started the company from his 

bedroom nine years ago, he wasn’t certain if 
people would even pay for his social media 
scheduling service.
  At the time, social media managers were 
still manually logging into multiple social 
media platforms and posting their content. 
They used calendars and reminders to tell 
them the perfect moment to log in and post 
across time zones. This wasn’t ideal, especially 
when it occurred in the middle of the night.

c01.indd   292

2/3/2020   5:54:04 PM

Actions 
Evidence that Buffer should be built. 
After generating evidence and insights into 
the demand of Buffer, Joel decided to build 
the application. He used this learning to 
help shape his price points for launch. Joel 
also kept it lean and manually processed 
the payments for each customer early on. 
Today Buffer is used by hundreds of thou-
sands of customers around the world and 
has a monthly recurring revenue of $1.54 
million.

an option, an email signup form appeared 
stating Buffer wasn’t quite yet ready for 
launch. Each option in the page had ana-
lytics integrated, so Joel could analyze who 
was signing up based on the selected price.

Evidence 
A $5/month signal. 
The evidence showed that the $5/month 
plan was the clear winner in this initial test. 
This option generated the most email  
signups when he compared it to the $0 and 
$20 options.

Insights 
People were interested in paying. 
With the data showing the $5/month plan 
being the most popular, it started to become 
clear how people valued Buffer. They didn't 
need to only schedule one tweet a day, 
because they could simply log in and do 
that. On the other hand, they didn't need 
unlimited tweets because social media man-
agers don't want to overwhelm their audi-
ence and be perceived as spam. The sweet 
spot seemed to be 5 tweets per day, where 
it was enough of a hassle that people would 
pay a $5/month fee to address.

The Buffer application would solve that 
problem, beginning with a scheduling service 
for Twitter, before expanding to additional 
social media platforms. Joel decided to 
lightly test the desirability of the Buffer app 
by adding a “Plans and Pricing” button to 
his simple landing page. When clicked, it 
displayed a message about not being ready 
yet with an email signup to be notified. 
  After a few people submitted their email, 
Joel determined there was initial interest but 
wanted to collect more evidence.

Hypothesis 
Joel believed that people would pay a 
monthly fee to schedule their social media 
posts on Twitter.  
It wasn’t enough that people would enter 
their email without any pricing information. 
Joel needed to know if it was viable.

Experiment 
Price testing different monthly fees to 
gauge viability. 
Joel decided to test viability by adding three 
different payment tier options to the landing 
page. Free = $0/month for 1 tweet a day and 
5 tweets in your buffer queue. Standard = 
$5/month for 10 tweets a day and 50 tweets 
in your buffer queue. Max = $20/month 
for unlimited tweets a day and unlimited 
tweets in your buffer queue. These options 
appeared once people clicked the “Plans 
and Pricing” button. Once people clicked

Customer feedback

Feedback is weak but generally good  
for qualitative insights.

Capabilities 
Product / Technology / Legal / Finance 
To create a letter of intent it helps to have 
basic legal understanding, even though it’s a 
non-legal document. If using it with partners, 
you’ll need to be able to articulate the key 
activity or key resource needed in detail. 
For B2B customers, you’ll need to be able to 
speak clearly about your value proposition 
and pricing structure.

Requirements 
Warm Leads 
Unless you have warm leads, meaning there 
is a basic understanding of your perceived 
Value Proposition and business, then we 
don’t recommend using a letter of intent. It 
would be poor form to cold email your LOIs 
to people, resulting in a dismal conversion 
rate. Instead, have the LOI ready for sched-
uled conversations so that you can present 
it during or shortly after the meeting.

LETTER OF INTENT
Using LOIs with Landscapers
Thrive Smart Systems

Thrive Smart Systems is a company set 

on empowering people with the latest 
in irrigation technology. Their wireless sys-
tem saves you time and money, providing 
smarter irrigation.

c01.indd   298

2/3/2020   5:54:08 PM

The cofounders, Seth Bangerter and Grant 
Rowberry, wanted to know if people would 
buy their product before they completed 
product development. Many people, land-
scapers in particular, expressed so much 
interest that when they asked them how 
many they would buy they would respond 
with “a ton” or “as many as you can give 
me.” While this was exciting to hear, Seth 
and Grant wanted to get a firm number on 
how many these customers were willing to 
purchase. 
  The Thrive team chose to have interested  
customers write a letter of intent to purchase.  
The idea was to allow people to write down, 
in numbers,  precisely what they wanted. 
Seth and Grant decided to make a template  
to include vital elements that a letter 
of intent should have. When a potential 
customer stated they are willing to buy x 
amount of Thrive’s product, then x amount 
was to be placed on the letter of intent. 
  Thrive called this template their letter  
of intent form.  

Hypothesis 
Seth and Grant believed that they could 
generate $25,000 during the test phase 
through 20 LOIs. 

Experiment 
Asking customers to write an LOI. 
They began to test this hypothesis by ask-
ing interested customers to write a Letter of 
Intent for how many units they were willing 
to purchase.  
  After receiving a few, they created a LOI 
template to pass out to each person that 
expresses interest in buying the product. 

Actions 
Iterating on the LOI approach. 
From the LOI experiments, Seth and Grant 
refined their LOIs to two different flavors. 
One being a “pledge of purchase” for those 
who want to buy the end product. The other 
flavor being a “testing agreement” for those 
who want to participate in the beta test.

Evidence 
Generating over $50k in purchases. 
The Thrive team found that with no advertis-
ing and by just asking potential customers 
to fill out a form, they could generate over 
$50,000 in projected revenue.

Insights 
Expectations versus reality. 
They also learned that the number of units 
people say they will purchase is much more 
than they are willing to put into writing. 
  Those who said they would buy 1000 units 
only wrote down that they will buy 300 units. 
A few who said they would buy 100 only 
wrote down that they will buy 15–20. From 
this, Seth and Grant gained insights into how 
to formalize their purchasing process. Even 
though the LOI is non-binding, when a poten-
tial customer puts pen to paper they have 
more skin in the game.

Evidence  

# of customer visits 
# of email signups 
Conversion rate on people who visited and 
provided their email addresses.

Customer Feedback 
Customer quotes provided in the feedback 
to you. 
  Customer visits, emails, and feedback are 
rather weak evidence, but good for qualita-
tive insights. 

Capabilities 
Design / Product / Legal / Sales / Marketing 
To set up and run a pop-up store, you’ll need 
legal expertise to determine licensing, per-
mits, lease, and insurance contracts. You’ll 
need online marketing skills to promote the 
store and sales experience to staff it for 
customer interaction.

Requirements 
Traffic 
Pop-up stores thrive on the idea of a niche, 
limited-time offer for customers. In order to 
create that demand, you’ll need to advertise 
and create buzz for your shop via:

# of presales 
# of mock sales 
# of sales 
Conversion rate on people who are willing  
to pay or paid for the product. 
  Sales are strong evidence that customers 
want your product.

•  online ads.
•  social media campaigns.
•  email campaigns.
•  word of mouth.

Cost 
Pop-up stores are generally small, but 
will still cost more money than low fidelity 
experiments. Much of the cost is leasing 
the space and advertising, which can vary 
depending on the location and access to 
the store. You can bring costs down if you 
can find an owner to give you extra space 
in their existing store for the experiment. 
Additional costs may include licenses,  
permits, and insurance required in order  
to conduct business transactions.

302

Setup Time 
Setup time for a pop-up store can take days 
or weeks, depending on what locations  
are available. It’ll need to look professional, 
which requires having the right people and 
appearance for the store. You’ll also need to 
create demand using ads, unless it is a very 
high traffic area with your target customers.

Run Time 
Run time for a pop-up store is generally 
short, from a few hours to a few days.  
The intent here is to learn quickly, synthesize 
the results, and move on.

Learning Through Temporary Retail
Topology Eyewear

Topology Eyewear aims to solve the 

problem of poorly fitting glasses, by 

making custom-tailored glasses that are 
sized and styled via an augmented reality 
app. Customers can take a selfie, see how 
different glasses look on their faces, and 
then purchase custom glasses that are spe-
cifically sculpted to fit their unique dimen-
sions. As with any new innovation, there are 
risky hypotheses that need to be tested.

customers face to face.

Even though the technology worked,  
the team needed to test for any barriers  
to adoption with customers. 

Hypothesis 
The Topology team believed that many 
people would identify with the problem of 
poor glasses fit, and would welcome the 
high-tech approach as a potential solution.

Experiment 
Getting out of the building with a  
pop-up store. 
The team rented a partially empty store-
front on San Francisco’s Union Street for  
a Friday and created a temporary company 
name — Alchemy Eyewear — and commis-
sioned posters and flyers to make it feel 
exclusive and exciting. Chris Guest, the 
marketing lead, went out onto the street to 
cold approach strangers, ask about their 
eyewear, summarize the pitch, and encour-
age them to visit the pop-up store. When 
customers entered the store, Topology staff 
would first ask them about the problems 
they experience with their eyewear, taking 
note of how they describe the problem in 
their own words. Then they would introduce 
our solution and note their response and 
what questions they asked about it. They 
would then demo the app using a default 
face model and note their responses and 
questions. They would then seek their per-
mission to take a face scan so they could 

try it for themselves. When loaded, they 
would guide them how to scan themselves 
and noted and answered their questions. On 
selecting a chosen design, they would ask 
if we could get their email address so we 
could save the design and send it to them.

Evidence 
Finding early adopters off of the street. 
Despite humble expectations, after 2 hours, 
they sold 4 pairs of glasses at an average 
price of about $400.  
  The conversion rates on email signups 
were too small to be meaningful in the 
absolute sense, but they were helpful to see 
where the biggest drop-off occurred in the 
the process.

Insights 
People knew their glasses didn’t fit,  
but weren’t sure why. 
Even though the team sold 4 pairs of 
glasses, it was the qualitative insights that 
were the most valuable.  
  The team noticed noticed that people 
seemed to be “symptom aware” but not 
“problem aware.” That is, when asked if they 
had a problem with fit, most people would say  
no. But when asked if their glasses slid down 
their nose, pinched, created red marks etc, 
most people would say yes. They understood  
the symptoms of bad fit, but nobody thought 
of it as being due to bad fit. This directed 
marketing messages for years afterwards.

criteria.

 □ Define your time box for  

the spike.

 □ Plan your start and end 

date.

Execute

 □ Write the code to achieve 
the acceptance criteria.

 □ Strongly consider pairing 

programming with another 
person to help navigate 
the code and create any 
needed tests.

Analyze

 □ Share what you’ve found 

with regards to:

• performance.

• level of complexity.

• outputs.

 □ Determine if the acceptance 
criteria were successfully 
met.

 □ Use what you’ve learned 

to build, borrow, or buy the 
necessary solution.

Cost 
Cost is relatively cheap and much more 
inexpensive than building the entire solu-
tion — only to find out at the end if it  
is feasible.

Setup Time 
Setup time for an Extreme Programming 
Spike is usually about one day. This is the  
time needed to research what methods are 
available and usually done by someone  
that already has technical expertise.

308

Run Time 
Run time for an Extreme Programming  
Spike is typically from 1 day to 2 weeks.  
It is aggressively time boxed for a reason —  
you are laser focused on testing feasibility 
for a specific solution.

DETAILS

Evidence  

Acceptance criteria 
The acceptance criteria defined for the spike 
was sufficiently met. Did the code perform 
the task and generate the output required? 

Recommendation 
The people working on the spike provide 
their recommendation on how steep of a 
learning curve it is to use the software and 
if it is fit for your purpose in creating the 
solution. 
  Spikes generate strong evidence: you are 
working with code that is representative of 
the bigger solution.

Capabilities 
Product / Technology / Data 
You’ll need product capabilities to clearly 
communicate how the solution creates the 
Value Proposition. This includes answering 
any questions from the team and customer 
expectations with regard to speed and  
quality. Data capabilities are also helpful if 
there is any visualization or analytics aspect 
to the spike. The most important capability 
you’ll need is technology and software, 
since the spike is usually working with code 
to produce a signal on the next course of 
action.

Requirements 
Acceptance Criteria 
Before performing a spike, clearly define the 
acceptance criteria and time box so that 
everyone is clear on the goal before getting 
started. These can turn into never-ending 
research projects if left unchecked.

SYNOPSIS

Experiment  
Pitfalls

The best plans for experimentation don’t 
always come through. We’ve learned this 
in working with teams to design, run, and 
analyze experiments over the years. Part 
of learning this process is becoming more 
proficient at quickly running experiments. 
We have found common pitfalls that you 
can identify early on and benefit from our 
mistakes.

Time Trap 
Not dedicating  
enough time. 

Analysis Paralysis 
Overthinking things  
that you should just 
test and adapt. 

Incomparable  
Data/Evidence 
Messy data that are  
not comparable. 

 – You get what you invest. 
Teams that don’t put in 
enough time to test busi-
ness ideas won’t get great 
results. Too often, teams 
underestimate what it takes 
to conduct multiple experi-
ments and test ideas well. 

 □ Carve out dedicated time 
every week to test, learn, 
and adapt.

 □ Set weekly goals in regard 
to what you’d like to learn 
about your hypotheses.

 □ Visualize your work so  
that it becomes clear  
when tasks are stalled  
or blocked.

 – Good ideas and concepts 
are important, but too 
many teams overthink and 
waste time, rather than get-
ting out of the building to 
test and adapt their ideas.

 □ Time box your analysis 

work.

 □ Differentiate between 

reversible and irreversible 
decisions. Act fast on the 
former. Take more time for 
the latter.

 □ Avoid debates of opinion. 
Conduct evidence-driven 
debates followed by 
decisions.

 – Too many teams are sloppy 

in defining their exact 
hypothesis, experiment, and 
metrics. That leads to data 
that are not comparable 
(e.g., not testing with the 
exact same customer seg-
ment or in wildly different 
contexts).

 □ Use the Test Card.

 □ Make test subject, experi-
ment context, and precise 
metrics explicit.

 □ Make sure everybody 

involved in running the 
experiment is part of the 
design.

Improving 
Business 
Models

318

Language

Facilitation

How you interact with teams while improving 
business models is also important. As you 
grow into a leader at higher levels of the 
organization, you’ll realize that facilitation 
skills are imperative. 
  We recommend taking courses on facil-
itation to level up your leadership game. 
There might be many different options to 
improve the business and instead of choos-
ing one, use facilitation to select multiple 
experiments. Have the evidence shape what 
approach works best for your business.

 □ “We, Us, Our”

 □ “How would you achieve this business outcome?”

 □ “Can you think of 2 – 3 additional experiments?” 

 – “I, Me, Mine”

 – “Deliver this feature by release date.”

 – “This is the only experiment we should run.”

Leaders who are improving existing business 
models need to be aware of their language 
and tone. Chances are you have evolved 
into a leader over time because you are an 
expert with knowledge and experience.  
  As you lead teams through experiment-
ing on a known business model, be mindful 
of the fact that overuse of your words can 
unintentionally disempower the teams. They 
may feel as though their decision-making 
authority is taken away, even if you are 
merely giving your opinion. They’ll simply 
wait for you to assign them experiments, 
which is not ideal. 

Accountability

Accountability often has a negative con-
notation in today’s organizations, but it 
doesn’t need to. Teams do not always need 
to be “held accountable” to hitting dates 
and releasing features. While features are 
important, they are outputs, not outcomes. 
Remember to focus on business outcomes, 
not just the features and dates. 
  Your teams need the opportunity to give 
an account on how they are experimenting 
and making progress toward business out-
comes. As a leader, it’s your job to create an 
environment for these opportunities to occur.

Inventing 
Business 
Models

Allow your intuition to guide  
you to a conclusion, no matter 
how imperfect — this is the  
“strong opinion” part. Then —  
and this is the “weakly held” 
part — prove yourself wrong.  

— Paul Saffo

Strong Opinions, Weakly Held

Inventing new business models requires 
experimentation and openness to the idea 
of being wrong. One way to think about this 
is from Paul Saffo’s “strong opinions, weakly 
held” approach. It means you start out with 
a hypothesis, but be open for it to be proven 
wrong. If you are merely trying to prove that 
you are right, then you become susceptible 
to your cognitive biases. 
  For example, when attending a stake-
holder review, teams will be sharing what 
they tested and where they want to go. If 
you lead with answers and ignore all of the 
data that contradict your opinion, it’ll be 
a very frustrating meeting for everyone. 
It’ll essentially unravel the experimentation 
culture you are trying to build.

 □ “What is your learning goal?”

 □ “What obstacles can I remove to help you  

make progress?”

 □ “How else might we approach this problem?”

 □ “What learning has surprised you so far?”

 – “I don’t trust the data.”

 – “I still think it’s a good idea and we should  

build it anyway.”

 – “You need to talk to 1,000 customers before  

it means anything.”

 – “This has to be a $15 million dollar business  

by the end of next year.”

Steps  
Leaders  
Can Take

320

Create an Enabling Environment: 
Processes, Metrics, and Culture

Make Sure Evidence Trumps Opinion: 
Change Decision-Making

Leadership’s key role in helping test 
business ideas is to create the right envi-
ronment. Give people enough time and 
resources to test ideas iteratively. Leaders 
need to abolish business plans and estab-
lish appropriate testing processes and 
metrics that differ from execution processes 
and metrics. They need to give teams the 
autonomy to make decisions, move fast, and 
then get out of the way. 

Leaders are used to deciding based on their 
often deep experience and extensive track 
record. Yet, in innovation and entrepreneur-
ship, past experience might actually prevent 
an individual from seeing and adapting 
to the future. Here evidence from testing 
trumps opinion. The leader’s role is to push 
a team to make a compelling case for an 
idea based on evidence, not based on the 
leader’s preferences. 

Remove Obstacles and Open Doors: 
Access to Customers, Brand, IP, and  
Other Resources

Ask Questions Rather Than Provide 
Answers: Help Teams Grow and Adapt 
Their Ideas

Leaders can remove obstacles when teams 
that are testing business ideas encounter 
internal roadblocks, like lack of access to 
internal expertise or specialized resources. 
Leaders can open doors to customers when 
required. It’s surprising how few corporate 
innovation and growth teams have easy 
access to customers to test new ideas. 

Leaders need to up their questioning skills 
to push teams to develop better value 
propositions and business models that 
can succeed in the real world. They need 
to relentlessly inquire about experiments, 
evidence, insights, and patterns on which 
teams build Value Propositions and business 
model ideas.

Meet Your Teams One-Half Step Ahead

Say “I Don’t Know.”

Leaders need to bring their teams along for 
the journey, instead of inadvertently leaving 
them behind. Think of where you eventually 
want team members to be, then look back-
ward. How will they get here? What steps 
will they have to take? It’s a small cognitive 
trick but it works. Leaders need a sense of 
where their teams are today and how to 
nudge them down that path. Find opportu-
nities to guide them to take that first step, 
whether it be in scheduled one-on-ones, 
retrospectives, or in hallway conversations.

Understand Context Before Giving Advice

Leaders need to actively listen and under-
stand the context before giving advice 
to team members. Practice letting team 
members speak until they are finished. Once 
there is a pause in the conversation, ask 
clarifying questions to make sure you under-
stand the context before giving advice. Don't 
get too excited and interrupt team members 
while they are speaking because you’ve 
already thought of an answer. You may pre-
maturely provide advice and connected dots 
where none exist.

These three simple words can strike fear 
into the heart of leaders. “I don’t know.” We 
often ask leaders when was the last time 
they uttered these three words in front of 
their employees. The answers range from 
“Why, just yesterday!” to “Never!” It’s the 
latter answer that is concerning. Imagine 
feeling the pressure of leading an organiza-
tion and always having the answers. There’s 
a good chance that you don’t have them. 
When building a culture of innovation and 
entrepreneurship, acting like you have all 
the answers can be disastrous. Teams will 
quickly see through the veil once they learn 
how to run experiments and generate their 
own evidence. Worse yet, you’ll feel like you 
have undermined your position of leadership 
by being proven wrong. Instead, we strongly 
recommend that you practice saying these 
three words, “I don’t know,” when you are 
in a situation where you don’t know. It 
will help your teams begin to understand 
that you don’t have all of the answers, nor 
should you. Follow it up with “How would you 
approach this?” or “What do you think we 
should do?” Saying “I don’t know” will help 
you model the behavior the leaders you 
create will embrace.

Silos vs. Cross- 
Functional 
Teams

Much of how we’ve structured organizations today 
is based on the Industrial Era. Back then, you would 
create a factory to assemble a product, such as an 
automobile. You’d break the creation of an automo-
bile into tasks, create an assembly line, and have 
workers complete the same task over and over. This 
works if you know the solution, since you can analyze 
your way to efficiently create the solution. Today’s 
corporations are, not coincidentally, modeled the 
same way. We create projects, break them down into 
tasks, and assign them across functions. Organizing 
by function can work if you truly know the problem 
and the solution — and nothing changes. 
  We’ve learned over the last few decades of work 
that rarely do we know the solution, especially in 
software. Things change fast. Really fast. So the idea 
that the solution is known and nothing changes is 
becoming less and less common in today’s market. 
This is why there has been a shift from traditional, 
functionally siloed organization models to more agile, 
cross-functional team approaches. When testing out 
new business ideas, speed and agility are imperative. 
cross-functional teams can adapt more quickly than 
functionally siloed teams. In many organizations, 
small, dedicated, cross-functional teams can outper-
form large, siloed project teams.

Thinking Like  
a Venture Capitalist

Another outdated model we observe in organizations pertains to 
funding. Many organizations still adhere to the big bang, annual 
funding style of the past. This severely limits the agility of the  
organization and incentivizes bad behavior. For example, if your 
department doesn’t spend all of its budget, then it is likely your 
budget for the upcoming fiscal year will be decreased. Therefore, 
budget is spent not on the most impactful activities, but those 
that will ensure there will be no money left at the end of the cycle. 
Annual funding also limits your at-bats, in that instead of taking one 
big home run swing, you’re much better off taking several base hit 
level swings. This is where organizations can learn from the Venture 
Capital community. Unfortunately, the level of patience and willing-
ness to give teams space is somewhat limited in organizations,  
as we illustrate below.

In contrast to the annual budgeting, orga-
nizations are adopting a more venture 
capitalist-style approach. This helps leaders 
invest incrementally in a series of business 
ideas and double down on the ones that are 
successful. It greatly increases your at-bats 
and your chance at finding a unicorn, 
instead of placing 1–2 large bets.

Investment Committees

Another important aspect of funding in a venture capitalist-style method is having a small 
investment committee that consists of leadership to usher the process along. These leaders  
in the organization need to have decision-making authority when it comes to budget, 
because they’ll be helping the teams navigate from seed, launch, and growth stages. 
These funding decisions typically take place in the Stakeholder Review Ceremony (see 
page 80). While we recommend stakeholder reviews to occur every month, the investment 
decisions usually take place at 3 – 6 month intervals, depending on your business venture. 
Here are some guidelines when it comes to creating your investment committee. 

Designing the Committee

Create a Working Agreement 

Foster an Environment 

•  3 – 5 members: Keep the committee rela-
tively small in size so that you can make 
decisions and run fast. 

Once assembled, create a working agree-
ment for the committee before inviting teams 
to present their recommendations. As a team, 
write down and agree upon rules such as:

This committee is in part responsible for fos-
tering the team environment we introduced 
on page 10.

327

•  External member: Consider adding an 
external member or entrepreneur in 
residence (EIR) who can help bring a fresh 
perspective to the portfolio. 

•  Decision-making authority: Include mem-
bers who can make decisions with regard 
to approval and budget. 

•  Entrepreneurial: While members do not 
necessarily have to have a history of 
entrepreneurship, they need to be willing 
to challenge the status quo. Too many 
conservative members will prematurely 
stunt the growth of new innovations.

•  Be on time: Members have busy sched-
ules, but they have to prioritize the 
stakeholder review ceremonies, otherwise 
teams will be left wondering if their initia-
tives are important. 

•  Make decisions in the meeting: Teams 

should not leave the review wondering if 
they can move forward. Decide with the 
teams present before adjourning. 

•  Leave ego at the door: Have an opinion in 
the review but be willing to be swayed by 
evidence. The teams will be bringing what 
experiments they ran and how to move 
forward. It is your job to listen, not talk 
over them.

Without your help, the teams will not be 
able to sustain over time even if they 
are cross-functional and exhibit the right 
behaviors.

As a committee, have a plan to revisit how 
you are helping the team with obstacles 
centered on:

•  Time.
•  Multitasking.
•  Funding.
•  Support.
•  Access.
•  Direction.

  A book can feel like a very large batch 
waterfall process. We did our best to test 
our content as we iterated along the way.  
I want to thank everyone who helped  
proofread and provided feedback early on. 
Your insights helped shape the book into 
what it is today. 

— David J. Bland 2019

I particularly want to thank Steve Blank,  
one of the seminal modern thinkers on entre-
preneurship, and a good friend and mentor. 
Without Steve’s Customer Development 
process, his founding of the entire Lean 
Startup movement, and his personal encour-
agement, my books would have remained a 
modern version of the business plan — great 
in concept, not grounded in reality. Steve’s 
thinking, experience, and writing on the topic 
of “getting out of the building” and testing 
ideas with customers, became the founda-
tion of much of my own thinking. Many of 
the ideas in this book emerged from long 
conversations with Steve, on walks at his 
beautiful ranch.

This book would have been impossible to 
create without the love and support of my 
wife, Elizabeth. She’s been my rock through-
out the years and continues to provide 
encouragement for me on this journey. Our 
kids have been amazing during this writing 
process, providing me with love and time to 
focus. So to Catherine, Isabella, and James:  
I thank you for cheering me on. I’m lucky to 
be a father to such amazing kids. 

I want to thank my coauthor Alex 

Osterwalder. He provided excellent guidance 
and insights throughout the entire book.  
It has been my pleasure and honor to have 
him be a part of this ambitious endeavor. I’d 
also like to thank Alan Smith and the entire 
Strategyzer team for putting in long hours 
and weekends creating such a beautifully 
designed book. 
  Testing Business Ideas is written from 
the viewpoint that we are standing on the 
shoulders of giants. To all of those who have 
influenced my thinking over the years, in 
small ways and in large, it is only because 
of you that this book exists. You were brave 
enough to put your thoughts out there for 
others to see.  

I want to thank all of you who continue to 

push these ideas forward in practice: Eric 
Ries, Steve Blank, Jeff Gothelf, Josh Seiden, 
Giff Constable, Janice Fraser, Jason Fraser,
