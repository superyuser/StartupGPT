In this episode of The Social Radars, Jessica Livingston and Carolynn Levy talk to Tracy Young, Co-Founder of PlanGrid.
PlanGrid revolutionized the construction industry by getting blueprints off paper and onto tablets. You’ll hear about how they found their idea, how they lost a cofounder to cancer in the first few weeks of YC, how they sold the company for almost a billion dollars in 2018, and how she’s now gone on to start a new startup called TigerEye.
